Y.",Improvements of Population Fitness and Trophic Status of a Benthic Predatory Fish Following a Trawling Ban,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,.,"Trawl fisheries have been shown to cause overfishing and destruction of benthic habitats in the seabed. To mitigate these impacts, a trawling ban has been enforced in Hong Kong waters since December 31, 2012 to rehabilitate the ecosystem and enhance fisheries resources. Previous studies demonstrated that reduced trawling activities would increase the heterogeneity of benthic habitats, thereby enhancing species richness and abundance of benthic fauna and providing more prey resources for predatory fishes. This study aimed to test a hypothesis that the population and trophic dynamics of the Bartail flathead Platycephalus indicus, a heavily fished benthic predatory fish, at inner and outer Tolo Channel of Hong Kong (i.e., EI and EO) improved with increases in their body size, abundance, biomass, trophic niche, and trophic position after the trawl ban. Samples were collected from trawl surveys before and after the trawl ban to compare the pre-ban and post-ban populations of P. indicus from EI and EO. Body size, abundance, and biomass were assessed in 2004, 2013-2014, and 2015-2016, whereas trophic niche and trophic position were analyzed based on stable isotopes of fish samples collected in dry season of 2012, 2015, and 2018. Following the trawl ban, the abundance and biomass of P. indicus increased in EO, with body size increased in EI. Furthermore, as indicated by the results of stable isotope analysis (SIA) on their tissues and prey items, trophic niche, and trophic position of P. indicus increased in EI and EO, respectively. Our study demonstrated that the trawl ban had promoted the recovery of a predatory fish population through restoring size structure and trophic dynamics.",0,2021,10.3389/fmars.2021.614219,WOS:000677563600001,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

However, certain areas within the Florida Keys, especially the Dry Tortugas and many upper mesophotic habitats (30-60 m), have maintained relatively healthy coral communities, even in the face of recent severe and widespread coral disease outbreaks. Relatively little is known about the genetic connectivity of corals among these sites or the potential for mesophotic sites to act as refugia by contributing to metapopulation recovery and persistence. Using a paired shallow and upper mesophotic sampling design, we assessed the genetic connectivity of a dominant, broadcast spawning coral species, Montastraea cavernosa, across the Northern and Southern Dry Tortugas, Lower Florida Keys, and Upper Florida Keys. A genetic dataset based on a suite of > 9000 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci indicated that the level of vertical genetic connectivity between paired shallow and upper mesophotic populations varied significantly based on location. Shallow and upper mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in the Northern Dry Tortugas and the Upper Keys were genetically similar. In contrast, populations were significantly differentiated across depth in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas. While upper mesophotic populations in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas were distinct from their shallow counterparts, there was evidence of relatively high levels of genetic connectivity to both the shallow and upper mesophotic populations downstream in the Upper Keys. These results suggest that while vertical connectivity between paired shallow and mesophotic populations can vary, certain upper mesophotic populations may fill an important role in maintaining coral metapopulations throughout the Florida Keys and should be considered in future management strategies.",0,2021,10.1007/s00338-021-02112-y,WOS:000658282800001,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs) are an increasing threat causing, for example, recent devastation to coral reefs around the world. We show that these impacts extend to adjacent terrestrial systems and could negatively affect the breeding of endangered species. We demonstrate that during an MHW that resulted in major coral bleaching and mortality in a large, remote marine protected area, anomalously warm temperatures also occurred on sea turtle nesting beaches. Granger causality testing showed that variations in sea surface temperature strongly influenced sand temperatures on beaches. We estimate that the warm conditions on both coral reefs and sandy beaches during the MHW were unprecedented in the last 70 years. Model predictions suggest that the most extreme female-biased hatchling sex ratio and the lowest hatchling survival in nests in the last 70 years both occurred during the heatwave.

Herein, we review studies characterizing thermal tolerance and cardiac performance in notothenioids - a group that includes both red-blooded species and the white-blooded, haemoglobinless icefishes - as well as the relevant biochemistry associated with cardiac failure during an acute temperature ramp. Because icefishes do not feed in captivity, making long-term acclimation studies unfeasible, we focus only on the responses of red-blooded notothenioids to warm acclimation. With acute warming, hearts of the white-blooded icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus display persistent arrhythmia at a lower temperature (8 degrees C) compared with those of the red-blooded Notothenia coriiceps (14 degrees C). When compared with the icefish, the enhanced cardiac performance of N. coriiceps during warming is associated with greater aerobic capacity, higher ATP levels, less oxidative damage and enhanced membrane integrity. Cardiac performance can be improved in N. coriiceps with warm acclimation to 5 degrees C for 6-9 weeks, accompanied by an increase in the temperature at which cardiac failure occurs. Also, both cardiac mitochondrial and microsomal membranes are remodelled in response to warm acclimation in N. coriiceps, displaying homeoviscous adaptation. Overall, cardiac performance in N. coriiceps is malleable and resilient to warming, yet thermal tolerance and plasticity vary among different species of notothenioid fishes; disruptions to the Antarctic ecosystem driven by climate warming and other anthropogenic activities endanger the survival of notothenioids, warranting greater protection afforded by an expansion of marine protected areas.",0,2021,10.1242/jeb.220129,WOS:000660873700001,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Physically isolated yet genetically connected reefs such as Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) may serve as potential refugia for degraded Caribbean reefs. However, little is known about the mechanisms and trade-offs of pathogen resistance in reef-building corals. Here, we measure pathogen resistance in Montastraea cavernosa from FGBNMS. We identified individual colonies that demonstrated resistance or susceptibility to Vibrio spp. in a controlled laboratory environment. Long-term growth patterns suggest no trade-off between disease resistance and calcification. Predictive (pre-exposure) gene expression highlights subtle differences between resistant and susceptible genets, encouraging future coral disease studies to investigate associations between resistance and replicative age and immune cell populations. Predictive gene expression associated with long-term growth underscores the role of transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions, contributing to the growing body of knowledge surrounding genes that influence calcification in reef-building corals. Together these results demonstrate that coral genets from isolated sanctuaries such as FGBNMS can withstand pathogen challenges and potentially aid restoration efforts in degraded reefs.

This decline is frequently attributed to fishing mortality, which increases in areas closer to humans and outside marine reserves. Although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of fishing mortality from other anthropogenic pressures on sharks, comparing shark abundance and diversity in jurisdictions with near zero fishing mortality versus prevalent shark fishing can demonstrate the role of overfishing. We used baited remote underwater video systems to compare shark abundance and diversity on coral reefs in 2 Caribbean nations with contrasting levels of shark exploitation: Belize (shark fishing) and The Bahamas (shark sanctuary). The abundance of targeted shark species and diversity were significantly higher in The Bahamas than in Belize. Caribbean reef and nurse shark abundance in Belize were best predicted by fishing-related factors (marine reserves, market gravity, their interaction). In The Bahamas, abiotic factors (depth, sea surface temperature) best predicted nurse shark abundance, while depth, market gravity, and its interaction with marine reserves predicted Caribbean reef shark abundance. These results indicate that fishing mortality reduces shark abundance and diversity in Belize, while lower fishing mortality in The Bahamas has greatly reduced but not eliminated human impacts on sharks. Future work should elucidate the indirect effects of humans to develop holistic shark conservation plans. We suggest minimizing shark fishing through multinational management plans to improve shark abundance and diversity, especially on reefs near densely populated areas.",2,2021,10.3354/meps13607,WOS:000629155900012,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Availability of shells affects population traits, including density and size structure, influencing their fitness and survival. Locality and human presence can induce variation in the diversity and size of gastropod shells, influencing available shells for hermit crabs. We assessed how the diversity, size, and abundance of the occupied species of gastropod shells affect the density and demography of C. clypeatus in two marine protected areas (MPA) with different recreational use in Puerto Rico, Manati (high) and Mona Island (low). We also evaluated the relationship between three shell traits (length, width, and aperture length) and the length of the crab chela as a size proxy. We did not find differences in the sex ratio. The density and median chela sizes were higher in crabs from Manati. In Mona, however, they reached larger sizes. The diversity of occupied shell species was higher in Manati than in Mona. Dimensions of occupied shells differed between genera and between study sites, and they scaled positively with hermit crab size. Differences in shells diversity, sizes, and abundance between MPAs might cause differences in density and demography of C. clypeatus. We only found large shells of Cittarium pica (Linnaeus, 1758), the only species occupied by larger individuals, occupied by hermit crabs in Mona. The low abundance of C. pica shells in Manati might have affected the size of hermit crabs in this locality.

The implementation of MPAs has been known to alter trophic cascades and community dynamics, and with invertebrates commonly at the base of these systems, it is vital that their status is investigated. Overcrowding in areas closed to fishing is known to have parasitological consequences in some scenarios, and land/water use change has been known to alter host and vector communities, possibly elevating disease risk. Equally, reserves can be used as tools for alleviating impacts of marine disease. This review aims to consolidate extant literature and provide a comprehensive viewpoint on how invertebrates (and their health status) can be affected by MPAs, which are increasingly being implemented based on the relative urgency now being placed on protecting global biodiversity.

However, the recovery of predators following the establishment of marine reserves and the consequent cessation of fishing may have indirect negative effects on prey populations by increasing prey mortality. We coupled field surveys with empirical predation assays (i.e. tethering experiments) inside and outside of 3 no-take marine reserves in kelp forests along the central California coast to quantify the strength of interactions between predatory fishes and their crustacean prey. Results indicated elevated densities and biomass of invertebrate predators inside marine reserves compared to nearby fished sites, but no significant differences in prey densities. The increased abundance of predators inside marine reserves translated to a significant increase in mortality of 2 species of decapod crustaceans, the dock shrimp Pandalus danae and the cryptic kelp crab Pugettia richii, in tethering experiments. Shrimp mortality rates were 4.6 times greater, while crab mortality rates were 7 times greater inside reserves. For both prey species, the time to 50% mortality was negatively associated with the density and biomass of invertebrate predators (i.e. higher mortality rates where predators were more abundant). Video analyses indicated that macro-invertivore fishes arrived 2 times faster to tethering arrays at sites inside marine reserves and began attacking tethered prey more rapidly.

In this study, we compare reef condition (substrate composition) and function (taxonomic and morphological diversity of hard corals) among 15 reefs surveyed in the Western Province, Solomon Islands that span a range of local disturbance and conservation histories. Overall, we found high cover of live hard coral (15-64%) and diverse coral assemblages despite an unprecedented 36-month global bleaching event in the three years leading up to our surveys in 2018. However, there was significant variation in coral cover and diversity across the 15 reefs surveyed, suggesting that impacts of global disturbance events are moderated at smaller scales by local anthropogenic factors (fisheries extraction, land-use impacts, marine management) and environmental (hydrodynamics) conditions. Our study provides evidence that relatively healthy reefs persist at some locations in the Solomon Islands and that local stewardship practices have the potential to impact reef condition at subregional scales.

Temporal turnover of the taxa within sites was consistently high (similar to 40%) due to both inter-annual episodic and directional changes. Turnover with time displayed a rapid increase and slow decline after sequential cool and warm thermal anomalies between 1996 and 1998. Subsequent warm temperature anomalies caused fewer broad-scale changes. Directional change for all sites combined indicated three overall gains and losses in taxa-Montipora being the only dominant taxon that declined in both abundance and presence/absence. The studied marine reserves had higher local but lower between-site taxonomic richness than fished reefs. Despite similar mean turnover, there were fewer gains than losses in marine reserves (7 gains and 20 losses in 5 sites) than fished sites (16 gains and 15 losses in 7 sites). Changes in taxonomic cover and presence/absence turnover data were not correlated, indicating that turnover detects finer scale taxonomic change likely to be missed when the cover of the dominant taxa is evaluated-especially in the higher richness marine reserves.

We trapped eels inside and outside of Blue Cavern Onshore State Marine Conservation Area, an MPA on the northwest side of Santa Catalina Island, CA which prohibits the take of any species. Over 4 years, we captured 1736 eels. Overall, we found that morays were longer, older, heavier, had higher body condition, and were found in greater abundance within the MPA. Although fish comprised the majority of their summer diet, morays outside of the MPA were consuming a more diverse set of fish, while kelp bass comprised more than half of the diet for morays inhabiting the MPA. Additionally, we found that morays within the MPA had larger relative vertical gape distances (VGDs) and narrower heads. Our recapture data support the high site fidelity of morays, indicating that their diet and morphology are influenced by their local community. While the majority of morays are thriving in the MPA, as suggested by their robust sizes and longevity, high abundance appears to result in higher frequencies of cannibalism, the presence of an undescribed disease, and lower growth rates. Our results suggest that the MPA affects the life history of morays and may select for an alternative feeding strategy in which eels develop larger VGDs, smaller adductor muscles, and a specialized diet which is presumably influenced by the local environment. In addition, observations of cannibalistic behavior and species-specific disease provide us with important insight into natural factors that may still regulate populations removed from anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing.",2,2020,10.1093/icb/icaa061,WOS:000582722400024,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

These pressures have caused widespread declines in reef health, resulting in the increased use of spatial management tools such as marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs have proven generally effective if well designed and enforced, but there are limited long-term studies investigating how the presence of small-scale MPAs affects fish populations and reef communities. Using a 12-year time series, we found that small-scale (10-50 ha) community-managed MPAs along the Danajon Bank of the Philippines preserved average fish biomass within their boundaries over time relative to surrounding fished reefs. Unprotected areas are, however, showing significant long-term biomass decline. MPAs were also found to preserve more key trophic groups and larger-bodied commercially targeted reef fish families. Fish biomass of piscivore, scavenger and invertivore trophic groups inside individual MPAs is, however, still declining at a similar rate as outside. Surprisingly, long-term benthic cover and growth form composition were not significantly affected overall by MPA presence, despite the sporadic use of highly destructive dynamite fishing in this region. Coral cover has remained historically low (21-28%) throughout the study, following widespread bleaching mortality. While management tempered overall abundance declines, we found that irrespective of MPA presence, there was a generalised decline of both large- and small-bodied fish size groups across the study region, most steeply within the 20-30 cm length fish, and a shift towards proportionally higher abundances of small (5-10 cm) fish. This indicates a combination of over-exploitation, inadequate MPA size and coverage for larger fish, and the lingering effects of the 1998 bleaching event. Generalised shifts in body size and trophic structure reported here could lead to future reductions in fishery productivity and stability and will be further exacerbated unless broader fishery regulations and enforcement is instated.",1,2020,10.1007/s00338-020-01987-7,WOS:000554334900001,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,live cover,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Such MPA protection relies on a shift in size-dependent mortality, the measurement of which can therefore serve as an early indicator of whether MPAs might achieve the desired longer-term ecological and evolutionary responses. We directly measured MPA effects on size-selective mortality and associated size structure using mark-recapture data on European lobster (Homarus gammarus) collected at three MPA-control area pairs in southern Norway during one decade (n = 5,943). Mark-recapture modeling, accounting for variation in recapture probabilities, revealed (1) that annual mean survival was higher inside MPAs (0.592) vs. control areas (0.298) and (2) that significant negative relationships between survival and body size occurred at the control areas but not in the MPAs, where the effect of body size was predominantly positive.

The losses were caused by a combination of coral disease and bleaching, with possible contributions from other stressors, including pollution and predation. Reproduction in the wild by fragment regeneration and sexual recruitment is inadequate to offset population declines. Starting in 2007, the Coral Restoration Foundation (TM) evaluated the feasibility of outplanting A. cervicornis colonies to reefs in the Florida Keys to restore populations at sites where the species was previously abundant. Reported here are the results of 20 coral outplanting projects with each project defined as a cohort of colonies outplanted at the same time and location. Photogrammetric analysis and in situ monitoring (2007 to 2015) measured survivorship, growth, and condition of 2419 colonies. Survivorship was initially high but generally decreased after two years. Survivorship among projects based on colony counts ranged from 4% to 89% for seven cohorts monitored at least five years. Weibull survival models were used to estimate survivorship beyond the duration of the projects and ranged from approximately 0% to over 35% after five years and 0% to 10% after seven years. Growth rate averaged 10 cm/year during the first two years then plateaued in subsequent years. After four years, approximately one-third of surviving colonies were >= 50 cm in maximum diameter. Projects used three to sixteen different genotypes and significant differences did not occur in survivorship, condition, or growth. Restoration times for three reefs were calculated based on NOAA Recovery Plan (NRP) metrics (colony abundance and size) and the findings from projects reported here.

While some sites were minimally impacted, others registered significant decreases in coral cover and community changes persisting till March 2017, when normal colouration was mostly regained by corals. Bleaching susceptibility was associated with larger corallites in hermaphrodites and smaller corallites in gonochores (probably due to the cost of maintaining dual sexual functions in hermaphrodites), and with increasing proximity between polyps (likely because thermal damage would be less contained among polyps with greater physiological integration).

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effectiveness of a crab closure area adjacent to an intensive fishery, by examining relative abundance, population demographics, and seasonal movement patterns within and outside of a closure area. Relative abundance and population demographics were assessed weekly from August to October, using standardized trap lines distributed at four locations, stratified by treatment (inside versus outside of closure area) and water depth. To obtain individual male crab movement data within and outside of the closure area, mobile acoustic tracking surveys were conducted one to three times per week in the autumn and winter. Male crabs were larger and in greater abundance inside the closure area than outside. The overall trend in male crab movement was southwest towards deeper water during autumn and winter. Our research supports the hypothesis that fisheries decrease the abundance and size of an exploited species, but closure areas may reduce these effects. Based on the observed seasonal movement patterns of crabs, it appeared that the closure area provided a temporary refuge from harvest.

Here we assess ecological responses to no-take marine reserves over two decades, spanning a major climate-driven coral bleaching event. Pre-bleaching reserve responses were consistent with a large literature, with higher coral cover, more species of fish, and greater fish biomass, particularly of upper trophic levels. However, in the 16 years following coral mortality, reserve effects were absent for the reef benthos, and greatly diminished for fish species richness. Positive fish biomass effects persisted, but the groups of fish benefiting from marine reserves profoundly changed, with low trophic level herbivores dominating the responses. These findings highlight that while marine reserves still have important roles on coral reefs in the face of climate change, the species and functional groups they benefit will be substantially altered.

Coral colony sizes in the SPS may vary with depth within a small-distance (< 1 km) scale and with the presence of marine protected areas (MPA) but studies rarely demonstrate this variability in Indo-Pacific coral reefs.

However, conservation outcomes of MPAs for mobile and long-lived predators such as sharks are highly variable. Here, we use empirical animal tracking data from 459 individual sharks and baited remote underwater video surveys undertaken in 36 countries to construct an empirically supported individual-based model that estimates the conservation effectiveness of MPAs for five species of coral reef-associated sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus perezi, and Ginglymostoma cirratum). We demonstrate how species-specific individual movement traits can contribute to fishing mortality of sharks found within MPAs as they move outside to adjacent fishing grounds. We discovered that the world's officially recorded coral reef-based managed areas (with a median width of 9.4 km) would need to be enforced as strict no-take MPAs and up to 5 times larger to expect protection of the majority of individuals of the five investigated reef shark species. The magnitude of this effect depended on local abundances and fishing pressure, with MPAs required to be 1.6-2.6 times larger to protect the same number of Atlantic and Caribbean species, which occur at lower abundances than similar species in the western Pacific. Furthermore, our model was used to quantify partially substantial reductions (>50%) in fishing mortality resulting from small increases in MPA size, allowing us to bridge a critical gap between traditional conservation planning and fisheries management.

Analysis of satellite-derived temperature data indicated that Aldabra was exposed to the highest bleaching-risk intensity of the past 20 years during this bleaching event. Bleaching-risk conditions lasted from December 2015 to June 2016 close to the 4 degrees C-week threshold, when bleaching is expected.

From a pre-bleaching benthic community in which living corals and epilithic algal matrix (EAM) predominated, Aldabra's reefs switched to an EAM-dominated community 8 months after bleaching. Soft corals declined by 93% of their overall pre-bleaching cover to < 1%. Although overall hard-coral cover was also reduced, the decline varied among depths and might indicate local adaptations of the lagoonal reef, due to greater variability in sea surface temperature compared to the seaward reef.

Mortality was spread over 0.06 km(2), with up to 80% coral mortality reported in some areas. Within days, response efforts were underway to investigate the potential mechanisms leading to the mortality event. Hydrographic surveys, moored buoy data, and a regional hydrodynamic model were used to characterize water chemistry, hydrography, and microbial communities within the FGB. Low salinity (~ 31-33), total alkalinity (~ 2284-2330 mu mol kg(-1)), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, ~ 1968-2011 mu mol kg(-1)) were detected in surface waters over the EB and eastern stations, revealing the presence of river-derived water. The Mississippi/Atchafalaya rivers were the primary sources of freshwater during the event, although Texas rivers, all of which had unusually high discharge during 2016, contributed approximately one-fifth to the total freshwater mass. At 75 m depth, high density, salinity, DIC, ammonium, and abundance of microbial taxa associated with deep waters were coincident with low temperature and aragonite saturation state at the northern and eastern stations, indicating a deeper source water at these stations. Cross-slope density gradients were also consistent with an upwelling circulation pattern. Using these observations and data, we hypothesize that the mortality event was most likely caused by the combination of two processes. The turbid freshwater layer inhibited photosynthesis, leading to net respiration of coral reef organic matter. Additionally, deep, dense waters upwelled onto the bank and formed a stratified bottom layer, which prevented re-oxygenation from the overlying water column and led to localized areas of hypoxia within pockets on the reef. Hypoxia likely formed rapidly, within two days.

The use of aquatic protected areas (APAs) has been promoted as a means of offsetting the negative consequences that are associated with fishing mortality by protecting the full suite of phenotypes. However, little work has investigated whether APAs are able to maintain heterogeneity in behavioral traits in wild fish. We attempted to address this question by using wild Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus from Lake Opinicon, a freshwater system consisting of both an APA and heavily fished areas. The Bluegill were obtained via angling from three zones in the lake: the main lake area (i.e., fished), the APA (which has been in place since the 1940s), and a transitional zone between these two areas. In the laboratory, the Bluegill were subjected to two behavioral assessments, a Z-maze and a flight-initiation-distance (FID) test, to address differences in boldness and risk-taking between these populations. No significant effects of capture zone were detected for any of the behavioral metrics that were assessed in the maze trial. However, individuals that originated from the main lake population had significantly higher FID scores than the fish from the transitional zone and the APA did, indicating that they were more timid. Our results suggest that fisheries activities may only be acting only on specific traits, which may explain some of the null results that are presented here.

Global bleaching events are becoming more frequent and stronger, and understanding how corals can tolerate and survive high-temperature stress should be accorded paramount priority. Here, we review evidence of the different mechanisms that corals employ to mitigate thermal stress, which include association with thermally tolerant endosymbionts, acclimatisation, and adaptation processes. These differences highlight the physiological diversity and complexity of symbiotic organisms, such as scleractinian corals, where each species (coral host and microbial endosymbionts) responds differently to thermal stress.

But as new fishers arise throughout the years, the perception of local abundance changes which might result in a shifting baselines syndrome. We investigated how the perception of fishers about species abundance changed through time (from 1970 to 2016) and space (five ports), through questionnaires in the small-scale/artisanal fisheries of Murcia, Spain. Two major results emerged, firstly species catches significantly decreased between the decades 1970-1990 and 2000-2016, possibly due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catches of species with some particular functional traits decreased (96%) possibly due to lower plasticity or to a fishing down the food web effect. Secondly, some functional trait categories (very large size, deep water depth, large yearly displacements and very vagile) were the highest in the northern ports of San Pedro del Pinatar and Cartagena while Cabo de Palos had the highest values in species with solitary and territorial behaviour and vagile or sedentary mobility.

At about 190 km off the Texas coast, at the top the seamount in the East FGB, up to 82% of coral reef organisms were affected in a 1-2 m thick layer on the local seafloor at similar to 23 in depth. Analysis of available data pointed to low levels of dissolved oxygen being the most likely contributing factor in the observed mortality (Johnston et al., 2019).Observations show that upwelling-favorable winds in June and July 2016 carried brackish and turbid coastal waters across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf to the FGB. This plume of coastal water was the result of exceptionally high precipitation and local river run-off. Field data provide clear evidence of thin, localized, subsurface near-hypoxic layers immediately below this turbid, low salinity coastal plume. These midwater layers extended over longer distances (30-40 kin), and reached further offshore (similar to 100 km), than previously reported in the region, associated with large quantities of organic matter carried offshore by the brackish plume.The surface brackish layer was observed to cover the East FGB in satellite ocean color imagery and in situ salinity measurements in late June and July 2016. Model results and sparse observations on the shelf suggest that this surface layer was similar to 20 m thick. It is expected that organic matter carried in the surface layer accumulated on the seafloor of the East FGB, which was just below the brackish plume. In the absence of ventilation, this led to the local formation of a bottom hypoxic layer, similar to what is observed on the Gulf of Mexico inner to midshelf every summer.The conditions experienced at FGB in July 2016 are likely to affect other reefs exposed to brackish plumes with high organic matter loads. The processes of physical connectivity by transport of material is critical for reef colonization and survival, but can also be fatal to coral ecosystems. The monitoring of coral reefs should take the threat of hypoxia due to distant sources of organic matter into account.",4,2019,10.1016/j.csr.2019.103988,WOS:000504520600003,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

However, a mortality event, affecting 5.6 ha (2.6% of the area) of the East FGB, occurred in late July 2016 and coincided with storm-generated freshwater runoff extending offshore and over the reef system. To capture the immediate effects of storm-driven freshwater runoff on coral and symbiont physiology, we leveraged the heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017 by sampling FGB corals at two time points: September 2017, when surface water salinity was reduced (similar to 34 ppt); and 1 month later when salinity had returned to typical levels (similar to 36 ppt in October 2017). Tissue samples (N = 47) collected midday were immediately preserved for gene expression profiling from two congeneric coral species (Orbicella faveolata and Orbicella franksi) from the East and West FGB to determine the physiological consequences of storm-derived runoff. In the coral, differences between host species and sampling time points accounted for the majority of differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology enrichment for genes differentially expressed immediately after Hurricane Harvey indicated increases in cellular oxidative stress responses. Although tissue loss was not observed on FGB reefs following Hurricane Harvey, our results suggest that poor water quality following this storm caused FGB corals to experience sub-lethal stress. We also found dramatic expression differences across sampling time points in the coral's algal symbiont, Breviolum minutum. Some of these differentially expressed genes may be involved in the symbionts' response to changing environments, including a group of differentially expressed post-transcriptional RNA modification genes. In this study, we cannot disentangle the effects of reduced salinity from the collection time point, so these expression patterns could also be related to seasonality.

Corals at EFGB and WFGB showed no signs of bleaching until September 2016, occurring later in the year compared to other reefs in the Caribbean region. Coral bleaching and subsequent recovery at each bank were documented through a time series of repetitive photographs within previously established long-term monitoring stations. Preceding the event, mean live coral cover within monitoring stations was collectively 64 +/- 2%. Prior to signs of bleaching from July to September 2016, seawater temperatures on the reef were above 30 degrees C for a total of 36 d at EFGB and 21 d at WFGB. By October 2016, 67 +/- 5% of the coral cover within EFGB monitoring stations and 25 +/- 3% within WFGB monitoring stations exhibited signs of bleaching or paling stress, with dissimilarities in the amount of bleaching most likely due to significant differences in thermal profiles between banks. Significantly increasing long-term trends for daily mean seawater temperature indicate that temperatures on the banks have become warmer over time, and calculated bleaching threshold curves suggest that more than 50 d above 29.5 degrees C would initiate a bleaching year at EFGB and WFGB. Even though recovery within monitoring stations at both banks was documented with no significant declines in mean coral cover from 2016 to 2017 (64% and 62%, respectively), it is likely FGBNMS will be subject to additional and more frequent bleaching events in the future as ocean temperatures continue to rise.",7,2019,10.1007/s00338-019-01788-7,WOS:000479051100020,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

While similar host densities were recorded inside and outside the MPA, parasitic prevalence was significantly lower inside the MPA. These differences among MPAs and non-MPAs in parasite prevalence and host availability, as well as the strong host specificity pattern, were consistent throughout time.

Fluctuations in sea surface temperatures trigger bleaching events in coral colonies that lead to increased coral mortality and reef degradation. To combat the decline in coral cover, many researchers have focused on transplanting coral colonies to better understand which species are best adapted to these environmental changes. This current study examined the impacts of two consecutive thermal stress events on transplanted coral colonies in the middle Florida Keys within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Coral fragments of two species (Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea) were transplanted on seven reef sites. Transplanted colonies were monitored for evidence of coral bleaching during quarterly sampling trips from June 2013 through June 2017. Bleaching was only observed during the late summer of 2014 and 2015 when Degree Heating Weeks exceeded 4 degrees C-weeks. Results indicate that P. astreoides colonies had significantly higher bleaching than S. siderea colonies. Reefs differed in their proportion of bleached and unbleached corals for P. asteroides, but these reefs did not differ in their average daily maximum temperature or Degree Heating Weeks. However, individual corals that did bleach had a higher average fleshy algal abundance (Dictyota spp.) surrounding them than those corals that remained unbleached. Corals that bleached the first year and survived were no more or less likely to bleach the second year.

Our model accounts for biological, ecological and environmental processes, as well as spatial variation in water quality and the cumulative effects of coral diseases, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and tropical cyclones. Our projections reconstruct coral cover trajectories between 1996 and 2017 over a total reef area of 14,780 km(2), predicting a mean annual coral loss of -0.67%/year mostly due to the impact of cyclones, followed by starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching. Coral growth rate was the highest for outer shelf coral communities characterized by digitate and tabulate Acropora spp. and exposed to low seasonal variations in salinity and sea surface temperature, and the lowest for inner-shelf communities exposed to reduced water quality. We show that coral resilience (defined as the net effect of resistance and recovery following disturbance) was negatively related to the frequency of river plume conditions, and to reef accessibility to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, reef resilience was substantially lower within no-take marine protected areas, however this difference was mostly driven by the effect of water quality.

Although variation in length-max (SLMAX), growth, age-max (AMAX), and the von Bertalanffy metrics of L-inf and K were found within and among latitudes, the greatest variation in some demographic characteristics was found among distance strata across the shelf regardless of latitude. Fish were always relatively smaller at inner shelf reefs and grew more slowly when compared to mid and outer shelf reefs; this was true regardless of the color morph of fish. The oldest fish collected was 11 years old, and there was no consistent variation in age-max among distances from shore. On outer reefs, there was a negative linear relationship with age-max and latitude. This tropical gradient of age only explained 34% of the variation; furthermore, this was not found when only the oldest group of fish was considered (top 10%). Fish only reached an age-max of six years on the southernmost reefs. There was a trend for a smaller L-inf with latitude but it was not significant and L-inf did not vary predictably with water temperature.

In contrast, warming had detrimental consequences for the long-term viability of red coral populations, driving steady declines and potential local extinctions due to sharp effects in survival rates. Stochastic demographic models revealed only a weak compensatory effect of MPAs on the impacts of warming.Policy implications. Our results suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) are an effective local conservation tool for enhancing the structural complexity of red coral populations. However, MPAs may not be enough to ensure red coral's persistence under future increases in thermal stress. Accordingly, conservation strategies aiming to ensure the persistence and functional role of red coral populations should include management actions at both local (well-enforced MPAs) and global scales (reductions in greenhouse gas emissions). Finally, this study unravels the divergent demographic consequences that can arise from multiple stressors and highlights the key role of demography in better understanding and predicting the consequences of combined impacts for vulnerable ecosystems.",9,2019,10.1111/1365-2664.13321,WOS:000471343200004,model,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,NA,mortality,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

Historically, this reef system has harbored a healthy coral community, relatively free of disease with limited mortality from bleaching or other factors. In July 2016 an unprecedented localized mortality event was documented at East Flower Garden Bank affecting an area of approximately 5.6 ha (2.6% of the coral reef). Within this area, up to 82% of the coral colonies succumbed to partial or total mortality, along with invertebrates spanning numerous taxa, including cnidarians, poriferans, echinoderms, crustaceans, and mollusks. Within the affected area, the impact was highly stratified, with many coral colonies exhibiting a clear line of delineation with polyps above appearing healthy, and those below exhibiting paling, bleaching, tissue sloughing, and/or mortality. The mortality of sessile invertebrates across multiple taxa was similar to observations from coral mortality events in other regions associated with low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. While instrumentation for measuring DO was not in place on East Flower Garden Bank, DO sensors at similar depths located 50-70 km northwest of East Flower Garden Bank confirmed low DO levels (< 3.5 mg L-1) at the time of the event.

In this fishery there are several large marine protected areas, including Closed Area I of Georges Bank. Intense drop camera surveys of Closed Area I in 1999 led to incorporating a 700-km(2) area into the rotational management scheme. There was a larger abundance of scallops to the south of this area, and these were made available for harvest in 2005, but this fishery was closed in 2006 when the management plan was overturned by a federal court decision. When the area was reopened again in 2011, however, the expected harvest was not achieved. Although fishermen harvested the scallops and opened the shells to extract the meat, they found that many of the meats were gray and not of marketable quality and so they discarded them. The gray meats were linked to a highly pathogenic apicomplexan infection. There was a 52% decline in exploitable biomass between 2011 and 2013 (7,300 metric tons, representing a gross revenue of US$170 million) that could not be attributed to a reduction in landings, resulting in a failure to complete the allotted trips.

Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate.

Each archipelago has locations where fishing had not occurred for at least 30 years, providing a rare opportunity to examine the effects of exploitation on the age and size compositions, growth, and mortality of these species. Overall, age-based data reveal a greater effect of fishing pressure than those based on size. This difference highlights concerns with size-based analyses; when species have protracted asymptotic growth trajectories, the resulting fishing impacts may not be readily apparent in size-based analyses because size and age become decoupled. This decoupling also confounds comparisons of growth among areas with different exploitation levels. Mortality estimates derived from an age-based catch curve for the unfished areas (where total mortality equals natural mortality) were comparable to those produced by using a maximum- age-based natural mortality estimator. The comparison of these methods indicates that the age-based natural mortality estimator is suitable for use in deepwater snapper stock assessments when direct measures of natural mortality are unavailable.",1,2019,10.7755/FB.117.4.5,WOS:000509940200005,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

Kennedy; Lonhart, Steve I.; Stachowicz, John J.",Fished species uniformly reduced escape behaviors in response to protection,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,.,"Predation is a critical ecological process that alters the structure and functioning of ecosystems through density mediated and trait-mediated effects on lower trophic levels. Although studies have focused on harvest-driven reductions in abundances and sizes of targeted species, human harvest also alters species morphologies, life histories, and behaviors by selection, plasticity, and shifts in species interactions. Restricting harvest can recover the biomass of targeted species, but it is less clear how behavioral phenotypes recover, particularly relative to the impacts of potentially opposing pathways of human influence. We investigated the effects of protection on the behavioral traits of a marine fish assemblage, recording behavior of 1377 individual fishes of nine targeted kelp forest species across 16 California marine protected areas (MPAs) varying in age, protection level, and diver visitation. With long-term, full protection from harvest, all fish species exhibited shorter flight initiation distance (FID, or the distance at which an animal flees from an approaching threat) and longer time delays before fleeing, despite differences in trophic position, microhabitat use, and other ecological characteristics. These escape behaviors were amplified across new MPAs regardless of protection level, suggesting that recovery is slow and likely the result of differences in genetic or early-life experience among individuals in these long-lived species. Although the effects of full protection from harvest were partially offset by recovering populations of large piscivorous predators, the net effect of long-term, full protection on fish behavior was shorter FID. Additionally, all species had shorter FID at sites more frequently visited by divers, and this effect was greater in sites with long-term, full protection from fishing. To the extent that escape behavior is correlated with foraging behavior and predation rates, these results suggest that human-induced behavioral changes may affect ecosystem processes, even after abundances have recovered. If recovery of ecosystem functioning and services are the management goal, assessments should be broadened to include the recovery of functional traits (including behavior).",4,2018,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.030,WOS:000445992900025,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

Populations of young sharks that rely on shallow coastal habitats, e.g. as nursery areas, may be at risk of experiencing these stressors. The purpose of this study was to characterize various components of the physiological stress response of neonatal reef sharks following exposure to an exhaustive challenge under relevant environmental conditions. To accomplish this, we monitored markers of the secondary stress response and measured oxygen uptake rates (MO2) to compare to laboratory-derived baseline values in neonatal blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens). Measurements occurred over three hours following exposure to an exhaustive challenge (gill-net capture with air exposure). Blood lactate concentrations and pH deviated from baseline values at the 3-h sample, indicating that both species were still stressed 3 h after capture. Evidence of a temperature effect on physiological status of either species was equivocal over 28-31 degrees C. However, aspects of the physiological response were species-specific; N. acutidens exhibited a larger difference in blood pH relative to baseline values than C. melanopterus, possibly owing to higher minimum MO2 . Neither species experienced immediate mortality during the exhaustive challenge; although, single instances of delayed mortality were documented for each species.

How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species(4) and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching(2), declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade(5,6) . However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits(7).",93,2018,10.1038/s41586-018-0359-9,WOS:000440552600050,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

Six sites in the southern islands have demonstrated low to moderate coral community (scattered colonies, but no carbonate framework) recovery.

We hypothesized that under relatively homogeneous hydrographic conditions, individual life history trait strategies should dominate signals of geochemical signatures. We tested our hypothesis by analyzing individual chronologies of otolith signals of strontium to calcium (Sr:Ca) and barium to calcium (Ba:Ca) ratios in a sedentary coastal fish (Diplodus annularis). Two areas from the same northwest Mediterranean region with different levels of fishing pressure were sampled: (1) a no-take marine protected area where the bigger-is-better strategy should prevail (energy allocation is biased toward growth to compensate for high natural mortality at small sizes) and (2) a highly exploited population where the smaller-is-better strategy should dominate (energy allocation is biased toward reproduction to compensate for high fishing mortality at large sizes). Significant differences in reproduction vs. growth trade-offs were observed between the sub-populations. Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca chronologies were compared between back-calculated ontogenetic stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) and sub-populations/life histories using a general linear mixed model. The Sr:Ca chronology successfully reproduced the allocation of energy for growth or reproduction according to the life history strategy of the individual, whereas correlation between ontogeny and otolith microchemistry was less obvious for Ba:Ca.

Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phe-notypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Cteno-chaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (L-inf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L-50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A(50)) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment.

Mass mortality events in scallops have been reported worldwide, often with the causative agent(s) remaining uncharacterized. In May 2013 and 2014, two mass mortality events affecting king scallops were recorded in the Lyme Bay marine protected area (MPA) in Southwest England. Histopathological examination showed gill epithelial tissues infected with intracellular microcolonies (IMCs) of bacteria resembling Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs), often with bacteria released in vascular spaces. Large colonies were associated with cellular and tissue disruption of the gills. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the intracellular location of these organisms in affected epithelial cells. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the putative IMCs obtained from infected king scallop gill samples, collected from both mortality events, were identical and had a 99.4% identity to 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from Candidatus Endo-nucleobacter bathymodioli and 95% with Endozoicomonas species. In situ hybridization assays using 16S rRNA gene probes confirmed the presence of the sequenced IMC gene in the gill tissues. Additional DNA sequences of the bacterium were obtained using high-throughput (Illumina) sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis identified over 1,000 genes with high similarity to protein sequences from Endozoicomonas spp. (ranging from 77 to 87% identity). Specific PCR assays were developed and applied to screen for the presence of IMC 16S rRNA gene sequences in king scallop gill tissues collected at the Lyme Bay MPA during 2015 and 2016.

In situ bleaching surveys and satellite data were used to evaluate the relative importance of potential drivers of bleaching patterns in 2014, assess the subsequent morality and its effects on coral communities and 3D complexity, test for signs of regional acclimation, and investigate long-term change in heat stress in PMNM. Surveys conducted at four island/atoll (French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and Midway Atoll) showed that in 2014, percent bleaching varied considerably between islands/atolls and habitats (back reef/fore reef and depth), and was up to 91% in shallow habitats at Lisianski. The percent bleaching during the 2014 event was best explained by a combination of duration of heat stress measured by Coral Reef Watch's satellite Degree Heating Week, relative community susceptibility (bleaching susceptibility score of each taxon * the taxon's abundance relative to the total number of colonies), depth and region. Mean coral cover at permanent Lisianski monitoring sites decreased by 68% due to severe losses of Montipora dilatata complex, resulting in rapid reductions in habitat complexity. Spatial distribution of the 2014 bleaching was significantly different from the 2002 and 2004 bleaching events likely due to a combination of differences in heat stress and local acclimatization.

Worldwide coral bleaching-related mortality is increasing and data has shown even isolated and protected reefs are vulnerable to the effects of global climate change. In 2014 and 2015, coral reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) suffered up to 90% bleaching, with higher than 50% subsequent mortality in some areas. The location and severity of bleaching and mortality was strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal patterns of elevated seawater temperatures. The main objective of this research was to understand the spatial extent of bleaching mortality in Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve (HBNP), O'ahu, Hawai'i to gain a baseline understanding of the physical processes that influence localized bleaching dynamics. Surveys at HBNP in October 2015 and January 2016 revealed extensive bleaching (47%) and high levels of coral mortality (9.8%). Bleaching was highly variable among the four HBNP sectors and ranged from a low of similar to 31% in the central bay at Channel (CH) to a high of 57% in the area most frequented by visitors (Keyhole; KH). The highest levels of bleaching occurred in two sectors with different circulation patterns: KH experienced comparatively low circulation velocity and a low temperature increase while Witches Brew (WB) and Backdoors (BD) experienced higher circulation velocity and higher temperature increase. Cumulative mortality was highest at WB(5.0%) and at BD (2.9%) although WB circulation velocity is significantly higher. HBNP is minimally impacted by local factors that can lead to decline such as high fishing pressure or sedimentation although human use is high. Despite the lack of these influences, high coral mortality occurred.

This analysis uses pooled visual census data from 39 matched pairs of MPAs and fished reefs surveyed twice over a mean period of 3 yr, allowing for the comparison of abundance and demographic structure of fishes across both protected and fished areas over time. The meta-analysis revealed that (1) although fish density was higher inside MPAs within individual sampling periods, reef-wide fish density generally either increased or remained stable over time, and (2) reef-wide increases in large-bodied fish were evident between survey periods, indicating positive demographic shifts within both MPAs and adjacent areas. These results suggest that, over relatively few years of protection, MPAs in the Philippines are able to promote beneficial shifts in fish population structure throughout entire reef systems rather than simply maintaining stable populations within their borders. Demonstrating such benefits to adjacent reefs is critically important to the success of MPAs in the Philippines because compliance with closures of fishing grounds increases with realized benefits to fishing communities.

Despite the conceptual and practical difficulty in differentiating between disturbance and stress, which are often used interchangeably, the two terms bear different ecological meanings. Both are external agents, but the former causes mortality or physical damage (subtraction of biomass), whereas the latter causes physiological alteration (reduction in productivity). Sensitivity of marine organisms may thus have a dual connotation, being influenced in different ways by disturbance and by stress following major environmental change. Coralligenous assemblages, which shape unique biogenic formations in the Mediterranean Sea, are considered highly sensitive to change. In this paper, we propose a method to differentiate between disturbance and stress to assess the ecological status of the coralligenous assemblages. Disturbance sensitivity level (DSL) and stress sensitivity level (SSL) of the sessile organisms thriving in the coralligenous assemblages were combined into the integrated sensitivity level of coralligenous assemblages (ISLA) index. Changes in the coralligenous status were assessed in space, along a gradient of stress (human induced pressures) at several sites of the western Mediterranean, and in time, from a long-term series (1961-2008) at Mesco Reef (Ligurian Sea) that encompasses a mass mortality event in the 1990s. The quality of the coralligenous assemblages was lower in highly urbanised sites than that in sites in both marine protected areas and areas with low levels of urbanisation; moreover, the quality of the assemblages at Mesco Reef decreased during the last 50 years. Reduction in quality was mainly due to the increase in stress-tolerant and/or opportunist species (e.g. algal turfs, hydroids and encrusting sponges), the disappearance of the most sensitive macroalgae (e.g. Udoteaceae and erect Rhodophyta) and macro-invertebrates (e.g. Savalia savaglia, Alcyonium coralloides and Smittina cervicornis), and the appearance of invasive alien algal species. Although the specific indices of SSL or DSL well illustrated the changes in the spatial or temporal datasets, respectively, their integration in the ISLA index was more effective in measuring the change experienced by the coralligenous assemblages in both space and time.

With the sudden influx of tourism from the completion of a new highway, now is a crucial time to ensure that future tourist development in this region is locally driven and environmentally responsible. As coral reefs are a foundation of Miches' identity, economy, and natural wealth, they play an integral role in the realization of this goal. This study employed global reef monitoring protocols to conduct the first-ever quantitative health assessment of Miches' reefs in order to guide future management practices. Surveys of multi-taxa indicator species were conducted alongside assessments of coral bleaching, disease prevalence, and evidence of anthropogenic impacts. Key findings include extremely low abundances of fishery-targeted species, high prevalence of diseased coral, anchor damage at nearly every site, and high abundances of indicator species for nutrient-based pollution such as fertilizers and raw sewage. Deeper, offshore reefs exhibited better health than shallow, inshore reefs, though they were still more degraded than comparable reefs in Dominican marine protected areas. Overall, Miches reefs are highly threatened by four main factors: overfishing, land-based pollution, human-related structural damage, and coral bleaching. To improve the well-being of the region's coral reefs and the communities that depend on them, an adaptive management plan is recommended that encompasses strong fisheries regulations, basic yet consistent monitoring efforts, and the integration of land-based and marine management practices.

Hard coral cover influenced reef fish abundance and biomass but it did not affect the presence of Plectropomus spp. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve not only requires consideration of ecological connectivity, reserve size and location, but also socio-economic factors including compliance, enforcement availability and community participation to achieve greater benefits.

In southern California kelp forests, we investigated the size-dependence of the interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their predators, California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). Empirical tests examined how differences in predator size structure between reserve and fished areas affected size-specific urchin mortality. Sites inside marine reserves had greater sheephead size and biomass, while empirical feeding trials indicated that larger sheephead were required to successfully consume urchins of increasing test diameter. Evaluations of the selectivity of sheephead for two urchin species indicated that shorterspined purple urchins were attacked more frequently and successfully than longer-spined red urchins of the same size class, particularly at the largest test diameters. As a result of these size-specific interactions and the higher biomass of large sheephead inside reserves, urchin mortality rates were three times higher inside the reserve for both species. In addition, urchin mortality rates decreased with urchin size, and very few large urchins were successfully consumed in fished areas. The truncation of sheephead size structure that commonly occurs owing to fishing will probably result in reductions in urchin mortality, which may reduce the resilience of kelp beds to urchin barren formation. By contrast, the recovery of predator size structure in marine reserves may restore this resilience, but may be delayed until fish grow to sizes capable of consuming larger urchins.",23,2017,10.1098/rspb.2016.1936,WOS:000393414300010,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

A widely employed management action to restore reef communities is the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs). We measured the effectiveness of the MPA network in Belize in promoting increases in fish and coral populations and identified key ecological and environmental factors that influence reef community structure and potentially protection success. From 2009 to 2013, we annually surveyed 16 reefs in Belize, including 8 MPA sites (where ex tractive fishing is limited or prohibited) and 8 unprotected sites. At each site, we quantified the biomass of reef fishes, coral and macroalgal cover, and several biotic and abiotic variables that are known to affect reef inhabitants. High predatory reef fish and parrotfish biomass values were associated with high reef structural complexity and low wave exposure. Mean macroalgal cover was negatively associated with parrotfish biomass in 1 protected zone. However, mean macroalgal cover remained above 40% across all sites, and no change in coral cover was observed during the study. Our results indicate that fisheries restrictions alone do not lead to increases in coral cover even when successful for fishes.

The benefits of spillover, however, may not be realized if the populations or habitats outside of reserves are too degraded. We quantified oyster population density and demographics such as recruitment, growth, mortality, and potential larval output as a function of two types of oyster management strategies in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA: (1) natural reefs + harvested and (2) restored reefs + harvested. We compared these data to demographic data collected as a function of a third type of management strategy, (3) restored reefs + protected from harvest. Mean oyster recruitment was similar to 12 times higher in restored + harvested reefs than in natural + harvested reefs. Mean total oyster density was similar to 8- to 72-times higher in restored + protected reefs than in restored + harvested or natural + harvested reefs, respectively. Moreover, harvested reefs exhibited truncated size structure, and few or no individuals greater than legal size (75 mm), whereas protected reefs typically had a polymodal size structure, including many large individuals. We estimate that restored + protected reefs have similar to 4 to 700 times greater potential larval output m(-2) than restored + harvested or natural + harvested reefs, respectively. After accounting for total sound-wide areal coverage of each reef type, total potential larval output from restored + protected reefs was similar to 6 times greater than that from natural + harvested and restored + harvested reefs. Marine reserves can potentially subsidize harvested populations via larval spillover, however, in the case of oyster reefs in Pamlico Sound, the relatively degraded conditions of natural reefs (e.g., low vertical relief, low shell volume per square meter) may not provide much in the way of suitable settlement substrate to realize the benefits of larval spillover from reserves.

This study documents the recovery of the lobster Palinurus elephas within a large Mediterranean no-take marine reserve (MR) and uses it as a baseline to assess stock status in exploited grounds in the region. Lobster indices of density and biomass within the MR continued to increase after 25 years of protection, a period close to the species' lifespan. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in weight more than doubled from years 10th to 25th without fishing in the reserve while the increase of CPUE in numbers was only 20%. This faster increase in biomass reflected individual growth and spillover of predominantly smaller lobsters to adjacent grounds. A highly depleted status of exploited populations was inferred from the demographic structure and CPUEs, with fishery:MR ratios and reproductive potential indices below 0.05. In the MR the size-class of maximum egg production increased over time, in contrast to stable sizes classes in fished areas. The contribution of small lobster (<90 mm CL) to overall egg production was only 1.5% in the MR and 30% in the fished areas. Mortality estimated from recent size compositions was three to four times higher in fished areas than inside the MR, resulting in a reduction in predicted spawning potential per recruit close to 20% of the unfished level. This experiment emphasizes the value of long-term no-take areas as reference laboratories for investigating fishing effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, disease prevalence was threefold lower on reserve reefs following chronic exposure to terrestrial run-off from a degraded river catchment, when exposure duration was below the long-term site average. Examination of 35 predictor variables indicated that lower levels of derelict fishing line and injured corals inside reserves were correlated with lower levels of coral disease in both case studies, signifying that successful disease mitigation occurs when activities that damage reefs are restricted. Conversely, reserves were ineffective in moderating disease when sites were exposed to higher than average levels of run-off, demonstrating that reductions in water quality undermine resilience afforded by reserve protection.

Recovery potential was assumed to be high at sites with a relatively high abundance of the coral, low disease prevalence, high genetic diversity, and high rates of sexual reproduction.

In coral reef restoration, transplantation of nursery-grown corals is seen as a potential method to mitigate reef degradation and enhance recovery. The transplanted reef should be capable of recruiting new juvenile corals to ensure long-term resilience. Here, we quantified how coral transplantation influenced natural coral recruitment at a large-scale coral reef restoration site in Seychelles, Indian Ocean. Between November 2011 and June 2014 a total of 24,431 nursery-grown coral colonies from 10 different coral species were transplanted in 5,225 m(2) (0.52 ha) of degraded reef at the no-take marine reserve of Cousin Island Special Reserve in an attempt to assist in natural reef recovery. We present the results of research and monitoring conducted before and after coral transplantation to evaluate the positive effect that the project had on coral recruitment and reef recovery at the restored site. We quantified the density of coral recruits (spat <1 cm) and juveniles (colonies 1-5 cm) at the transplanted site, a degraded control site and a healthy control site at the marine reserve. We used ceramic tiles to estimate coral settlement and visual surveys with 1 m2 quadrats to estimate coral recruitment. Six months after tile deployment, total spat density at the transplanted site (123.4 +/- 13.3 spat m(-2)) was 1.8 times higher than at healthy site (68.4 +/- 7.8 spat m(-2)) and 1.6 times higher than at degraded site (78.2 +/- 7.17 spat m(-2)).

The results suggest that large-scale coral restoration may have a positive influence on coral recruitment and juveniles. The effect of key project techniques on the results are discussed.

Because densities of commonly exploited species are lower outside reserves, we hypothesised that limpets outside reserves will: (i) mature earlier; and (ii) show higher individual reproductive output. Rarely exploited species should show no such effects. For recruitment, we hypothesised that if recruits are attracted to adults or survive better where there are more adults, then commonly exploited (but not rarely exploited) species should show higher recruitment inside reserves. Analyses of gonadosomatic indices produced significant Month x Reserve interactions for all species (ANCOVA, p < 0.05), indicating inconsistent reserve effects even for exploited species, although months with significant differences occurred more often in the commonly exploited species, giving weak support to the hypothesis regarding reproductive output. Reserve status had no significant effect on sex ratios or size at sexual maturity for either sex of any species. Accordingly, reserves had only a minor influence on reproduction in these species, which might reflect an indirect effect of poor policing. The timing of major recruitment events differed among species, with two broad patterns: recruitment was sporadic for C. capensis and S. longicosta and protracted for H. concolor and S. granularis. Recruit densities showed strong site effects. Highest recruitment occurred at the exploited site, Xhora, with no reserve effects, except in a single month for C. capensis, indicating that recruitment is independent of whether the site is protected or not. Therefore, reserves do not enhance recruitment directly, but because these populations appear to be open on scales of tens of kilometres, generally higher densities of limpets within reserves could enhance overall recruitment, because of greater gamete output by the population. Accordingly, reserves might have an indirect 'spillover' effect on recruitment, if not a direct one.",0,2016,10.2989/1814232X.2016.1255255,WOS:000391853200009,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

One of the main problems for the conservation of this species is the substantial lack of data concerning the time span necessary for a population subjected to pluri-decennial harvesting pressure to return to its pristine status. Here, we present a multi-annual data set gathered from the Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Portofino, which hosts the most important shallow-water coral populations in the Ligurian Sea and was subjected to strong harvesting pressure from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Quantitative comparison of the population structure data recorded in 1964, 1990 and 2012 indicated a strong size increase of the colonies (from 3 to 8 g mean weight), resulting in an increase in colony biomass from 300 to the current 1500 g.m(-2). As a consequence, over the same span of time, the density of colonies has slightly decreased. The role of mass mortality phenomena, like that occurred in this area during 1999, as possible biological features triggering the switch of red coral populations from a 'grass plain-like' towards a 'forest-like' structure, is discussed.

Long-term assessments of targeted fish populations inside and outside areas closed to fishing are often necessary to elucidate these effects, yet few of these studies extend over long time periods. We assessed trends in the abundance and length of six targeted fish species in areas open and closed to fishing on seven occasions spanning a 9-year period (2005-2010 and 2013) at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia. Shallow (8-12 m) and deep (22-26 m) coral-dominated reef sites were sampled across four geographically separated island groups using baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV). Between 2005 and 2010, populations of Lethrinus miniatus, Lethrinus nebulosus, Plectropomus leopardus, and Chrysophrys auratus became increasingly dominated by larger individuals, potentially indicative of an ageing population. Between 2010 and 2013, however, there was a significant increase in the proportion of smaller L. miniatus, L. nebulosus, and P. leopardus in both open and closed areas, reflecting increased recruitment perhaps due to changing environmental conditions associated with a marine heat wave anomaly. This recruitment pulse was not observed for the other species in this study (Chr. auratus, Choerodon rubescens, and Glaucosoma hebraicum). Lethrinus miniatus, L. nebulosus, Chr. auratus, and P. leopardus were larger in closed areas relative to open areas; however, they were not more abundant.

Here, we investigated the influence of partial protection - excluding fixed gears such as gillnets and traps but still allowing a hook and line fishery - on the demography of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. To do so, we applied novel multi-event models to a 9-year data set containing both live recaptures and dead recoveries of marked fish of different sizes collected before and after the implementation of an MPA, also including several unprotected sites. At the MPA site, the annual proportion of deaths due to fishing decreased from 059 before MPA implementation to 032 after MPA implementation. As a result, annual survival increased by 167% (from 009 to 024) for small (16-44cm) and 83% (from 023 to 042) for big (45-97cm) cod, respectively. Average survival was lower in unprotected areas, and annual fishing mortality was higher, representing almost 100% of the total mortality of large-sized cod in some years. Annual emigration rates (i.e. spillover from the MPA) increased in the last years of the study, but no differences in body growth were detected between sites. Closure of the fishery within the MPA would further increase the annual survival of smaller individuals by 100% (from 024007 to 048011) and that of larger individuals by 44% (from 042 +/- 005 to 060 +/- 009).Synthesis and applications.

In this study, five sites within a small, but well enforced marine reserve at Cousin Island, were investigate using various methods to explore differences in coral habitat quality, coral recruitment, fish assemblages, key invertebrate grazers, and rugosity. The objective of the study was to collect a broad set of scientific data, which could be useful to describe linkage between coral reef and fish assemblages after a large-scale disturbance, as well as for future management decisions regarding marine resources, in terms of MPA protection and recovery abilities. The results showed high spatial variation in coral coverage between sites (from 1.5% to 43.2%), which were higher than previously reported, as well as high variation in dispersal of coral recruits. Furthermore, there were large heterogenic differences in fish densities and composition, which were directly linked to coral habitat quality, e.g. total fish abundance was 15 times higher on sites with high coral coverage in comparison to sites with low coral cover. In summary, this study demonstrates that coral reef habitat and fish assemblage may display high spatial variability and heterogenic differences after large-scale disturbances and suggests that potential recovery from coral mass mortality may occur in a non-linear and patchy procedure, which in turn may depend on underlying stocastical processes that affect coral recruitment and survivorship.

Pathogen invasion often succeeds physical wounding and injury, yet links between the reduction of damage and the moderation of disease have not been assessed. Here, we examine the utility of no-take marine reserves as tools for mitigating diseases that affect reef-building corals. We found that sites located within reserves had fourfold reductions in coral disease prevalence compared to non-reserve sites (80 466 corals surveyed). Of 31 explanatory variables assessed, coral damage and the abundance of derelict fishing line best explained differences in disease assemblages between reserves and non-reserves. Unexpectedly, we recorded significantly higher levels of disease, coral damage, and derelict fishing line in non-reserves with fishing gear restrictions than in those without gear restrictions. Fishers targeting stocks perceived to be less depleted, coupled with enhanced site access from immediately adjacent boat moorings, may explain these unexpected patterns. Significant correlations between the distance from mooring sites and prevalence values for a ciliate disease known to infest wounded tissue (r = -0.65), coral damage (r = -0.64), and the abundance of derelict fishing line (r = -0.85) corroborate this interpretation. This is the first study to link disease with recreational use intensity in a park, emphasizing the need to evaluate the placement of closures and their direct relationship to ecosystem health. Since corals are modular, ecological processes that govern reproductive and competitive fitness are frequently related to colony surface area therefore, even low levels of cumulative tissue loss from progressing diseases pose significant threats to reef coral persistence. Disease mitigation through reductions in physical injury in areas where human activities are concentrated is another mechanism by which protected areas may improve ecosystem resilience in a changing climate.",37,2015,10.1890/14-1952.1,WOS:000361152100022,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,

Data on free-ranging aquatic animals are comparatively scarce, and this represents a problem for estimating the consequences of human disturbance for organism fitness and therefore the functioning of aquatic systems. We used acoustic accelerometer and depth transmitters implanted in wild fish and archival stomach content data to test for relationships between the intensity of boating and the activity levels and foraging efficiency of an estuarine predatory fish, the mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus. Increasing boating activity (inferred from week-long trends in underwater noise and local maritime records) was associated with a reduction in activity levels and increased depth distributions of mulloway. Stomach content data from a nearby estuary revealed a far-lower feeding rate and altered diet composition on weekends (when boating activity is greatest) compared to weekdays for this species, and an inferred foraging success rate almost one-third that of weekdays. These data suggest the behaviour and foraging intensity of mulloway is significantly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance. The overall fitness costs of the reduction in foraging success will depend on how readily mulloway can reallocate foraging to less disturbed conditions, and the extent of stress-related responses to disturbance in this species.

Herewe document and predict long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of >90% live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse, pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories.

For example, selective harvesting of larger sized predators can release prey populations in cases where only large individuals are capable of consuming a particular prey species. In this study, we examined how the history of exploitation and recovery (inside marine reserves and due to fisheries management) of California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) has affected size-structured interactions with sea urchin prey in southern California. We show that fishing changes size structure by reducing sizes and alters life histories of sheephead, while management measures that lessen or remove fishing impacts (e.g. marine reserves, effort restrictions) reverse these effects and result in increases in density, size and biomass. We show that predation on sea urchins is size-dependent, such that the diet of larger sheephead is composed of more and larger sized urchins than the diet of smaller fish. These results have implications for kelp forest resilience, because urchins can overgraze kelp in the absence of top-down control. From surveys in a network of marine reserves, we report negative relationships between the abundance of sheephead and urchins and the abundance of urchins and fleshy macroalgae (including giant kelp), indicating the potential for cascading indirect positive effects of top predators on the abundance of primary producers. Management measures such as increased minimum size limits and marine reserves may serve to restore historical trophic roles of key predators and thereby enhance the resilience of marine ecosystems.",37,2015,10.1098/rspb.2014.1817,WOS:000354866500004,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

If persistence of live hard coral is a management goal, the existing protected areas within the Seychelles Bank may require review to ensure protection of sites with high recovery potential, while a suite of other management tools should be implemented in the remaining areas.

Small, early-maturing fish exhibit significantly reduced reproductive output and, ultimately, reduced fitness. As part of resource management and biodiversity conservation programs worldwide, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected to ameliorate the adverse effects of fishing pressure. In an attempt to advance our understanding of how coral reef MPAs meet their long-term goals, this study used visual census data from 23 MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines to address three questions: (1) Do MPAs promote shifts in fish body size frequency distribution towards larger body sizes when compared to fished reefs? (2) Do MPA size and (3) age contribute to the efficacy of MPAs in promoting such shifts? This study revealed that across all MPAs surveyed, the distribution of fishes between MPAs and fished reefs were similar; however, large-bodied fish were more abundant within MPAs, along with small, young-of-the-year individuals. Additionally, there was a significant shift in body size frequency distribution towards larger body sizes in 12 of 23 individual reef sites surveyed. Of 22 fish families, eleven demonstrated significantly different body size frequency distributions between MPAs and fished reefs, indicating that shifts in the size spectrum of fishes in response to protection are family-specific.

We assessed the frequency, magnitude, and dynamics of macroalgal-coral competition involving allelopathic and non-allelopathic macroalgae on three, spatially grouped pairs of no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and non-MPAs in Fiji. In non-MPAs, biomass of herbivorous fishes was 70-80% lower, macroalgal cover 4-9 fold higher, macroalgal-coral contacts 5-15 fold more frequent and 23-67 fold more extensive (measured as % of colony margin contacted by macroalgae), and coral cover 51-68% lower than in MPAs. Coral contacts with allelopathic macroalgae occurred less frequently than expected by chance across all sites, while contact with non-allelopathic macroalgae tended to occur more frequently than expected. Transplants of allelopathic macroalgae (Chlorodesmis fastigiata and Galaxaura filamentosa) against coral edges inflicted damage to Acropora aspera and Pocillopora damicornis more rapidly and extensively than to Porites cylindrica and Porites lobata, which appeared more resistant to these macroalgae. Montipora digitata experienced intermediate damage. Extent of damage from macroalgal contact was independent of coral colony size for each of the 10 macroalgal-coral pairings we established. When natural contacts with Galaxaura filamentosa were removed in the field, recovery was rapid for Porites lobata, but Pocillopora damicornis did not recover and damage continued to expand.

Increasing temperatures and solar radiation cause coral bleaching that has resulted in extensive coral mortality. Increasing carbon dioxide reduces seawater pH, slows coral growth, and may cause loss of reef structure. Management strategies include establishment of marine protected areas with environmental conditions that promote reef resiliency. However, few resilient reefs have been identified, and resiliency factors are poorly defined.Here we characterize the first natural, non-reef coral refuge from thermal stress and ocean acidification and identify resiliency factors for mangrove-coral habitats. We measured diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and seawater chemistry; characterized substrate parameters; and examined water circulation patterns in mangrove communities where scleractinian corals are growing attached to and under mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, St. John, US Virgin Islands. Additionally, we inventoried the coral species and quantified incidences of coral bleaching, mortality, and recovery for two major reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans and Diploria labyrinthiformis, growing in mangrove-shaded and exposed (unshaded) areas.Over 30 species of scleractinian corals were growing in association with mangroves. Corals were thriving in low-light (more than 70% attenuation of incident PAR) from mangrove shading and at higher temperatures than nearby reef tract corals. A higher percentage of C. natans colonies were living shaded by mangroves, and no shaded colonies were bleached. Fewer D. labyrinthiformis colonies were shaded by mangroves, however more unshaded colonies were bleached. A combination of substrate and habitat heterogeneity, proximity of different habitat types, hydrographic conditions, and biological influences on seawater chemistry generate chemical conditions that buffer against ocean acidification. This previously undocumented refuge for corals provides evidence for adaptation of coastal organisms and ecosystem transition due to recent climate change.

In the Belize Barrier Reef, there are several zones with increasing human activity and harvesting of overexploited species. Marine protected areas are designed to protect endangered species and increase the population size of exploited species. The present study investigated the population and morphological characteristics of Lobatus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve (SCMR) at the southernmost tip of the Belize Barrier Reef to estimate the effectiveness of the marine protected area.Results: A total of 693 L. gigas conches were counted over the 7,200 m(2) from 36 transect lines. The densities of juveniles and adult conches in the conservation zone were substantially higher (20.13 and 2.88 individuals/100 m(2), respectively) than in the general use zone (5.29 juveniles and 0.58 adults individuals/100 m(2)).

The potential fecundity (the stock of vitellogenic oocytes in the pre-spawning ovary), egg size (diameter and dry weight of artificially fertilized 1-day-old eggs) and gonad dry weight were assessed for fish sampled in SD 25 and SD 28. Multiple regression analysis identified somatic weight, or total length in combination with Fulton's condition factor, as main predictors of fecundity and gonad dry weight with stage of maturity (oocyte packing density or leading cohort) as an additional predictor. For egg size, somatic weight was identified as main predictor while otolith weight (proxy for age) was an additional predictor. Univariate analysis using GLM revealed significantly higher fecundity and gonad dry weight for turbot from SD 28 (3378-3474 oocytes/g somatic weight) compared to those from SD 25 (2343 oocytes/g somatic weight), with no difference in egg size (1.05 +/- 0.03 mm diameter and 46.8 +/- 6.5 mu g dry weight; mean +/- sd). The difference in egg production matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. This supports the hypothesis of higher size-specific fecundity towards the limit of the distribution of a species as an adaptation to harsher environmental conditions and lower offspring survival probabilities. Within SD 28 comparisons were made between two major fishing areas targeting spawning aggregations and a marine protected area without fishing. The outcome was inconclusive and is discussed with respect to potential fishery induced effects, effects of the salinity gradient, effects of specific year-classes, and effects of maturation status of sampled fish.

The aim was to identify the coral species which were most likely to suffer from (and to be able to tolerate) changes in seawater temperature. Significant differences in the susceptibility of the coral taxa to bleaching events between the years 1998 and 2010 and among coral species were documented. Bleaching was significantly different between the most dominant corals. Diploastrea heliopora was the most resistant coral to bleaching in both years. Some coral species showed more resistance to bleaching in 2010. The coral mortality following the mass bleaching events in 1998 and 2010 varied significantly between the years and the coral taxa. Mortality of some dominant coral taxa was also lower in 2010.

An understanding of the association between environmental factors and the prevalence of wasting disease in seagrass meadows is important for elucidating plant-pathogen interactions in coastal environments. We conducted a survey of 7 turtle grass-dominated beds within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to assess the relationship between environmental and biological parameters on seagrass health. All sites contained Labyrinthula spp.; the most pathogenic strain was obtained from an anthropogenically impacted site. Leaf and total biomass, in addition to root/rhizome carbon content, canopy light and % light transmitted, all displayed strong negative correlations with a wasting index (WI). It was noted that many of the same environmental measurements that showed negative correlations with WI also displayed strong positive correlations with canopy light levels. These data suggest that light availability may be an important factor that has previously been understated in the seagrass disease literature yet warrants more attention with respect to turtle grass susceptibility to infection. Studies such as this are important because they identify gaps in our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions in subtropical marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the relationships identified in this study may offer insight into which factors are most useful in identifying at-risk meadows prior to the onset of larger scale die-off events.

These reef communities have been poorly studied, and efficient conservation actions are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to: (1) examine the spatial distribution of coral assemblages in the lagoon of Tongatapu; (2) determine the degree to which spatial heterogeneity of adult corals is influenced by recruitment processes; and (3) examine the implications of these results in terms of conservation actions. We recorded a total of 37 adult and 28 juvenile coral genera, a mean density of 11.6 adult and 5.5 juvenile colonies m(-2), and a dominance of Montipora, Acropora, and Porites. For seven of the 10 dominant genera, spatial patterns of adults were linked to the short-term recruitment pattern history. Despite a reduced diversity and abundance of adult corals in some areas, the lagoon of Tongatapu retains the potential for replenishment through recruitment of young corals. Consequently, we suggest that conservation actions should focus on reducing factors causing coral mortality and maintain suitable conditions for the establishment and growth of juvenile corals, thus increasing the probability that they will reach maturity and participate to the maintenance of local populations. Rather than establishing a large marine protected area, which will almost certainly suffer from a lack of control and poor enforcement, alternative conservation measures could be successfully implemented through the establishment of several small village-based marine reserves, as has been undertaken in other South Pacific islands with promising results.",4,2013,10.1007/s10661-012-2982-5,WOS:000319753600032,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

K.",Transient responses of fished populations to marine reserve establishment,CONSERVATION LETTERS,.,"Implementation of no-take marine reserves is typically followed by monitoring to ensure that a reserve meets its intended goal, such as increasing the abundance of fished species. The factors affecting whether abundance will increase within a reserve are well characterized; however, those results are based on long-term equilibria of population models. Here we use age-structured models of a generic fish population to analyze the short-term transient response. We show that it may take decades for a fished population to reach postreserve equilibrium. In the meantime, short-term transient dynamics dominate. During the transient phase, population abundance could either remain unchanged, decrease, or exhibit single-generation oscillations, regardless of the eventual long-term result. Such transient dynamics are longer and more oscillatory for populations with heavier fishing, older ages at maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower larval connectivity. We provide metrics based on demographic data to describe the important characteristics of these postreserve transient dynamics.",48,2013,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00295.x,WOS:000319742900006,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

I? stolonifera appeared to be the only species affected, with the outer tunic the main site of infection. No signs of pollution or algal blooms were observed, but large variations in climatic conditions were associated with both events. The 1991 mortalities occurred during a warm spell in autumn, when there was a rapid increase in the daily air temperatures.

Here, we use a unique capture-mark-recapture data set from Kavra, an MPA on the west coast of Sweden where fishing for European lobster Homarus gammarus has been banned since 1989, to directly quantify annual survival probabilities in the absence of harvest mortality. The non-migratory behaviour of this species allowed multiple recaptures and releases of a large number of individuals within the MPA. We found strong evidence for a long-term decrease in sex specific natural mortality throughout the study period (1994 to 2007). Positive trends were evident in mean body size and in catch-per-unit-effort, the latter indicating an increase in abundance. Together, these findings suggest that after nearly 2 decades of protection, density dependence was still not halting development of the population within the MPA. The present study is the first to quantify long-term (14 yr) changes in natural mortality rates in a protected marine population. Moreover, our study supports the notion that MPAs and marine reserves may act to counter fisheries-induced selection.",19,2013,10.3354/meps10459,WOS:000325282500012,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

In this study the exceptional occurrence of the Mediterranean coral C. caespitosa in the Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (NW Mediterranean, Spain) is characterised in terms of spatial distribution, cover area, colony size and growth rates. The coral colonies form beds and banks in rocky bottoms within a semi-enclosed bay that offers both hydrodynamic protection and high water exchange. The spatial distribution of the C. caespitosa colonies, from 5 to 27 m depth, is highly aggregated, depending on sea-floor morphology and showing up to 80% of substrate coverage. The annual corallite growth rates obtained through the alizarin red staining method and x-ray image analysis are similar, and range between 2.55 +/- 0.79 mm and 2.54 +/- 0.81 mm, respectively. The exceptional nature of these bioconstructions is due to their cumulative cover area, which is comparable in size to the largest C. caespitosa bioconstructions described to date in Mljet National Park ( Croatia, Adriatic Sea).",33,2012,10.1111/j.1439-0485.2011.00508.x,WOS:000314406300004,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

In MPAs where macroalgae cover expanded since 1998 there was no recovery.

This study investigated mortality rates for female California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) at multiple sites inside and outside of three marine reserves at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, California, USA. Mean total mortality (Z) of female lobsters was lower at sites inside reserves (Z = 0.22 [+/- 0.05 SE]) than at sites outside reserves (Z = 0.59 [+/- 0.02 SE]). Mean mortality at all sites inside reserves, and among sites near reserve centres (where Z = 0.17 [+/- 0.05 SE]), was similar to estimates of natural mortality for other temperate spiny lobster species. Among sites inside reserves, there was a positive relationship between mortality and proximity to reserve borders, but this relationship was absent among sites outside reserves. Mortality estimates were much more variable among sites inside reserves than at sites in fished areas.

We asked experts and reviewed the scientific literature for guidance on the multiple physical and biological factors that affect the ability of coral reefs to resist and recover from climate disturbance. Eleven key factors to inform decisions based on scaling scientific evidence and the achievability of quantifying the factors were identified. Factors important to resistance and recovery, which are important components of resilience, were not strongly related, and should be assessed independently. The abundance of resistant (heat-tolerant) coral species and past temperature variability were perceived to provide the greatest resistance to climate change, while coral recruitment rates, and macroalgae abundance were most influential in the recovery process. Based on the 11 key factors, we tested an evidence-based framework for climate change resilience in an Indonesian marine protected area. The results suggest our evidence-weighted framework improved upon existing un-weighted methods in terms of characterizing resilience and distinguishing priority sites. The evaluation supports the concept that, despite high ecological complexity, relatively few strong variables can be important in influencing ecosystem dynamics. This is the first rigorous assessment of factors promoting coral reef resilience based on their perceived importance, empirical evidence, and feasibility of measurement. There were few differences between scientists' perceptions of factor importance and the scientific evidence found in journal publications but more before and after impact studies will be required to fully test the validity of all the factors.

However, our understanding of mortality and the factors that affect survival in wild populations remains limited, particularly for adult sharks. Long-term acoustic monitoring data were used to estimate mortality rates for juvenile pigeye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and adult spottail (Carcharhinus sorrah) sharks within the same coastal area. Estimates of mortality were low for both species (C. amboinensis: natural = 0.00-0.05 y(-1), fishing = 0.07-0.11 y(-1), total =0.11-0.13 y(-1); C. sorrah: natural = 0.05 y(-1), fishing= 0.03 y(-1), total =0.08 y(-1)). There were no significant differences in mortality rates between species (natural: p=0.972: fishing: p=0.965; total: p=0.935), despite the difference in species life stages. All monitored individuals were similar in body size, however, suggesting that size may play a greater role than age in the mortality rates for some shark species. High survivorship indicates that this coastal area provides a low mortality environment for both juvenile C. amboinensis and adult C. sorrah. Low mortality for these species is likely a reflection of low predation risk and sufficient prey resources. This, coupled with marine protected areas, may provide juvenile C. amboinensis and adult C. sorrah with similar opportunities and levels of protection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves.

Averting this disaster requires maintaining a sufficient spawning population to buffer stochastic fluctuations in recruitment of heavily harvested stocks. Optimal strategies for managing spawner biomass are well developed for temperate systems, yet remain uncertain for tropical fisheries, where the danger of collapse from recruitment overfishing looms largest. In this study, we explored empirically and through modeling, the role of marine reserves in maximizing spawner biomass of a heavily exploited reef fish, Lethrinus harak around Guam, Micronesia. On average, spawner biomass was 16 times higher inside the reserves compared with adjacent fished sites. Adult density and habitat-specific mean fish size were also significantly greater. We used these data in an age-structured population model to explore the effect of several management scenarios on L. harak demography. Under minimum-size limits, unlimited extraction and all rotational-closure scenarios, the model predicts that preferential mortality of larger and older fish prompt dramatic declines in spawner biomass and the proportion of male fish, as well as considerable declines in total abundance.

Given increasing human-derived stressors acting on marine ecosystems, the need for such effective action is urgently clear. Here we explore mechanisms underlying the utility of marine reserves to reinstate trophic dynamics and to increase resilience of kelp beds against climate-driven phase shift to sea urchin barrens on the rapidly warming Tasmanian east coast. Tethering and tagging experiments were used to examine size-and shelter-specific survival of the range-extending sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) translocated to reefs inside and outside no-take Tasmanian marine reserves. Results show that survival rates of C. rodgersii exposed on flat reef substratum by tethering were approximately seven times (small urchins 10.1 times; large urchins 6.1 times) lower on protected reef within marine reserve boundaries (high abundance of large predatory-capable lobsters) compared to fished reef (large predatory lobsters absent). When able to seek crevice shelter, tag-resighting models estimated that mortality rates of C. rodgersii were lower overall but remained 3.3 times (small urchins 2.1 times; large urchins 6.4 times) higher in the presence of large lobsters inside marine reserves, with higher survival of small urchins owing to greater access to crevices relative to large urchins. Indeed, shelter was 6.3 times and 3.1 times more important to survival of small and large urchins, respectively, on reserved relative to fished reef. Experimental results corroborate with surveys throughout the range extension region, showing greater occurrence of overgrazing on high-relief rocky habitats where shelter for C. rodgersii is readily available. This shows that ecosystem impacts mediated by range extension of such habitat-modifying organisms will be heterogeneous in space, and that marine systems with a more natural complement of large and thus functional predators, as achievable within no-take reserves, will minimize local risk of phase shifts by reinstating size and habitat-specific predator-prey dynamics eroded by fishing. Importantly, our findings also highlight the crucial need to account for the influence of size dynamics and habitat complexity on rates of key predator-prey interactions when managing expectations of ecosystem-level responses within marine reserve boundaries.",66,2012,10.1890/11-1587.1,WOS:000305836600014,field,CI,2004,MPA,Maria Island,12,old,1992,fully,12.3,12.3,medium,NA,Australia,temperate,Oceania,Tasman sea,rocky reef,invertebrate,Centrostephanus rodgersii,fished,no,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,NA,survival rate,figure 6a,negative,yes,percentage,se,0.57638889,2,0.02480159,0.03507474,0.13095238,2,0.00992063,0.0140299,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,0.00759073,

This variation can be induced by physical or biological factors such as wave exposure and predation. We examined shell variation in the direct-developing Acanthina monodon. In a field survey, we collected and analysed two snail ecotypes: a thick-shelled ecotype from environments with intense predation by the crab Homalaspis plana, and a thin-shelled ecotype from environments where predation was negligible. When we controlled for shell length, the thick-shelled ecotype had a heavier and thicker shell, but lower body weight, than the thin-shelled ecotype. However, only shell thickness and body weight showed a significant difference between habitat types. In order to determine the nature of shell variation in A. monodon, we conducted a laboratory experiment with juvenile snails from sites where the predation was low or absent. Seawater aquaria containing crabs were connected to aquaria containing snails via a cylinder with flows that enabled the transport of seawater from crabs to the snails aquaria. The snails treated with seawater-borne stimuli (predation treatment) developed thicker shells than the snails raised in the absence of the stimulus (control treatment).

Analysis of mtDNA and nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers, at both the local and regional scale, revealed that the majority of variation existed within locations rather than among them. Likewise, the majority of pairwise comparisons were non-significant between sites and locations. These results suggest that moderate to high gene flow occurs within and among populations of M. cavernosa in the Western Atlantic. The phylogeographic signature and significant pairwise comparisons among several locations, however, indicate that populations are also partially maintained through self-seeding and that gene flow may be restricted over large geographic distances.

Since antiquity, Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum) has been harvested intensively for use in jewelry, and its distribution is currently smaller than its historical size throughout the Mediterranean Sea. To assess whether establishment of marine reserves is associated with a change in the size and number of red coral colonies that historically were not harvested sustainably, we analyzed temporal changes in mean colony diameter and density from 1992 to 2005 within red coral populations at different study sites in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve (established in 1992) and in adjacent unprotected areas. Moreover, we compared colony size in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve, where recreational diving is allowed and poaching has been observed after reserve establishment, with colony size in three other marine protected areas (Banyuls, Carry-le-Rouet, and Scandola) with the enforced prohibition of fishing and diving. At the end of the study, the size of red coral colonies at all sampling sites in the Medes Islands was significantly smaller than predicted by growth models and smaller than those in marine protected areas without fishing and diving. The annual number of recreational dives and the percent change in the basal diameter of red coral colonies were negatively correlated, which suggests that abrasion by divers may increase the mortality rates of the largest red coral colonies within this reserve .

Additionally, we controlled for habitat variability across sites (1) by measuring relative abundance of sublegal adult lobsters (i.e. those not removed through fishing) and (2) through visual SCUBA surveys on which we quantified fine-scale habitat features. Traps placed in reserves yielded more (4.81 trap(-1)) and larger (7.03 mm CL) legal-sized lobsters than traps placed outside. Multiple linear regression revealed that 2.43 more legal lobsters per trap were captured for every 1 km moved from borders towards reserve centers. Additionally, lobsters tagged and released immediately inside reserve borders were recaptured in areas open to fishing at a higher rate than lobsters tagged and released farther inside reserves. These results suggest that abundance gradients inside reserve borders were caused by net emigration of lobsters (spillover).

As expected, the longer the closure, or time since fishing disturbance, the greater the mean age and body size metrics, and the lower the growth rate and mortality metrics. Unexpectedly, a linear decline in the mean trophic level of the fish community with the age of fisheries closure was found and was attributable to relatively slow recovery of the abundant herbivores. Trophic level and other life-history metrics were not significantly correlated with one another, and the life histories of herbivorous fishes (e. g. Acanthuridae, Scaridae) produced these weak relationships. None of the life-history metrics displayed clear leveling after 42 yr of closure, which corroborates other findings that indicate that the closures do not represent undisturbed or pristine ecosystems.

Colonies with approximately 30 to 35% of epibiont coverage showed significantly lower numbers of gonads per polyp.

Furthermore, massive broadcasting coral species exhibited greater losses over time than their smaller-sized counterparts across all sites, suggesting that local management actions have not alleviated the regional trend of high mortality for these species. We detected no difference in herbivorous fish abundances or macroalgal cover between reserve and fished sites, providing a potential explanation for the lack of cascading positive effects on the coral community.

This study used a mark-and-recapture approach to examine the population structure, individual growth, and mortality of the commercially harvested short-spined sea urchin Anthocidaris crassispina in a small (18 ha) no-take marine reserve and two nearby non-protected sites. Sea urchins were tagged with fluorochrome and recaptured 1 year later. The size-at-age relationship was modelled using the Tanaka function, and mortality estimated using an exponential decay function coupled with the Tanaka growth parameters. The urchin population in the reserve consisted of a higher proportion of older individuals than populations in the two non-protected areas, however, large sea urchins (>50 mm) were absent in the reserve. Sea urchins occurring at high densities (>15 ind. m(-2)) in the reserve grew much slower than those outside the reserve, suggesting a density-dependant effect on growth. Growth ring analysis from the rotulae supported the mark-andrecapture results with the maximum number of rings being higher in the reserve than in non-protected sites. Urchins with the same number of growth rings inside the reserve were smaller than those outside the reserve. Within the reserve, urchins with the same number of growth rings were smaller at locations with higher urchin density. Annual mortality rate was lower in the reserve population than in the non-protected populations. These results illustrate the effectiveness of this small reserve in protecting A. crassispina from fishing. However, further study is required to examine whether a high density of small/old individuals is better than a medium density of large individuals in order to maximize the potential spillover of larvae by such small urchin refugia to the surrounding overfished areas.

We found a high spatial variability in the structure and dynamics of C. zosteroides populations at small geographical scales, suggesting that environmental factors acting at the population level display a key role in population size structure, mortality and recruitment. The elevated mortality rates recorded at some locations (almost 80%) is amongst the highest recorded for perennial algae as a consequence of a single storm, emphasizing the importance of episodic catastrophic events in the maintenance of these deep-water, slow-growing populations.

Data regarding colony height, density, level of damage, and microbiological community were collected at two sites.

We identified a change in size class distribution following a mass mortality that leaves mainly small colonies with a decrease in habitat complexity.

This work is the second part of a paper (Hussein et al., 2011) which describes the parameterization of the model. Here we carry out a sensitivity analysis to identify the most significant model parameters. The simulation results show that the model is particularly sensitive to some parameters such as natural mortality, stage length, fecundity, number of inactive days per strategy and gear standardisation factors. Second, the impact of several management measures was evaluated (e.g. marine protected areas (MPAs) in the nursery and spawning zones, changes in gillnet mesh size and fishing effort reduction). Management scenarios were then assessed and compared using a simulation design. The results indicate that the permanent closures in the white seabream juvenile habitat for all gears, a change in gillnet mesh size and fishing effort reduction would result in an important increase in the population biomass and catch. The closures of the spawning zones appear inefficient in restoring D. sargus biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Coincident with accelerating degradation of coral reefs, expectations of the benefits that NTAs can provide for coastal societies and sustainability of marine ecosystems has grown. These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts.",61,2011,,WOS:000293419200003,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Although marine reserves have been proposed as a tool for fisheries management, their evolutionary implications have as yet attracted little scrutiny. A simple model is used to investigate whether marine reserves can be expected to mitigate the evolutionary impacts of fishing on maturation size. The adaptive dynamics of size at maturation are analysed based on a stage-structured population model including size-selective fishing and marine reserves with different retention rates. As has been shown before, imposing greater fishing mortality on the largest individuals promotes an evolutionary change towards smaller maturation size. In the model, protecting part of a fish stock using a marine reserve can prevent such fisheries-induced evolution, and this protection critically depends on the type and extent of movement between the reserve and the fished area. Specifically, although the frequent movement of large adults increases catches of large adult fish outside a marine reserve, it also reduces the reserve's effectiveness in preventing fisheries-induced evolution. In contrast, when there is exchange between protected and fished areas through juvenile export alone, a marine reserve can effectively prevent evolution towards smaller maturation size, but does so at the expense of reducing the yield of large adult fish. Differences in the movement behaviour of successive life stages need to be considered for marine reserves, to help make fisheries more sustainable evolutionarily.",28,2010,10.1093/icesjms/fsp248,WOS:000275818300002,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

The ecological, social, and economic value of coral reefs has made them an international conservation priority [2,3]. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in restoring fish populations [4] has led to optimism that they could also benefit corals by indirectly reducing threats like overfishing, which cause coral degradation and mortality [2,5]. However, the general efficacy of MPAs in increasing coral reef resilience has never been tested.Methodology/Principal Findings: We compiled a global database of 8534 live coral cover surveys from 1969-2006 to compare annual changes in coral cover inside 310 MPAs to unprotected areas. We found that on average, coral cover within MPAs remained constant, while coral cover on unprotected reefs declined. Although the short-term differences between unprotected and protected reefs are modest, they could be significant over the long-term if the effects are temporally consistent. Our results also suggest that older MPAs were generally more effective in preventing coral loss. Initially, coral cover continued to decrease after MPA establishment. Several years later, however, rates of coral cover decline slowed and then stabilized so that further losses stopped.Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that MPAs can be a useful tool not only for fisheries management, but also for maintaining coral cover. Furthermore, the benefits of MPAs appear to increase with the number of years since MPA establishment. Given the time needed to maximize MPA benefits, there should be increased emphasis on implementing new MPAs and strengthening the enforcement of existing MPAs.",210,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0009278,WOS:000274590600030,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Growth rates did not significantly differ for both sizes and were on average 0.67 cm month(-1). However, survival after 382 days of rearing T. gigas was significantly higher in the 10-cm SL clams than the 8-cm SL clams (96 and 83%, respectively). For future restocking projects, the use of 8-cm SL clams is recommended because the lower survival of this size class is compensated by its cheaper price. While rearing the clams to attain grow-out size, the population of wild clams (Family Tridacnidae) in Carbin Reef was assessed using ten 50 x 2-m belt transects. Four species of tridacnid clams have been recorded: Hippopus hippopus, Tridacna crocea, T. maxima, and T. squamosa. T. crocea comprised 12.5-93.9% of all the clams observed in all ten transects. There was a significant difference in clam density between species (ANOVA, F = 6.94, P < 0.001), with T. crocea having the highest density. Living T. gigas were absent, but presence of dead shells was indicative of its presence in the reef in the past.

For spiny lobsters, the relative and synergistic success of shelter dwelling and aggregation in reducing mortality may vary with the perceived risk of predation as well as the availability and size distribution of conspecifics and shelters. We tested how these factors influence antipredator behavior in the California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus in southern California kelp forests. We measured shelter and lobster characteristics, predator density, relative lobster mortality outside of shelter, and quantified lobster antipredator behaviors in (1) the La Jolla Ecological Reserve (LJER), a marine protected area with high densities of large fishes known to be lobster predators, and (2) the Point Loma kelp forest, a nearby, heavily fished area. Predator densities and the relative mortality of tethered juvenile and adult lobsters were much higher in the LJER than in Point Loma, as was mean lobster size. In response to higher predation risk, solitary lobsters in the LJER used shelters more closely scaled to their body size than lobsters in Point Loma, thereby restricting predator access to shelters. In addition, aggregations of 2 or more lobsters were more frequent than expected by chance in the LJER, but not in Point Loma. Lobsters in Point Loma commonly were found outside of shelter during the day, whereas no lobsters ever were observed outside of shelter during daylight hours in the LJER. Overall, our results indicate that California spiny lobsters modify their antipredatory behaviors with level of predation risk and that behaviors designed to minimize predator-induced mortality are similar between California spiny lobsters and other spiny lobster species.",13,2010,10.3354/meps08850,WOS:000285419300012,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Few studies, however, have explored the effects of MPAs on the demographic profiles of reef fish populations. We tested the assumption that areas closed to fishing for >7 yr accumulate older individuals of a heavily targeted species, Lethrinus harak. Our survey design included 2 protected sites and 2 comparative fished sites. Using an age-based length-conversion method, a novel approach in tropical fisheries, otolith-derived demographic information was supplemented with underwater visual census data. This approach provided valuable insights into the population dynamics of this species at small spatial scales (<2 km(2)). We found considerable site-specific differences in the age structure of L. harak, with protected sites having greater mean ages and lower total mortality. There was indication of density-dependent growth as greater size-at-age occurred in fished sites where biomass had been depleted. Although female L. harak reach 50% maturity at 208 mm fork length (FL) or age 3.8 yr, it is the largest and oldest females (>260 mm FL and >9 yr) who make a disproportionate contribution to overall reproductive output, as ovary weight increases exponentially with both length and age. Currently size (L-c) and age (t(c)) at first capture is similar to 100 mm and 2 yr below the size (L-50) and age (t(50)) at first maturity. Numerous management scenarios based on minimum size limits were evaluated to determine which scenario would increase spawning biomass without compromising yield estimates.

During a year we followed natural lesions that appeared on healthy ramets of a population on a degraded reef within a Marine Protected Area in Colombia, to infer the effect oil population size structure. From September 2003 to September 2004, 94% of the ramets presented lesions caused by bleaching, predation; or algae, sponge and borrower interactions. Predation caused 47% of the lesions and algae 36%; most lesions (85%) were small (<5cm(2)), although some were bigger than 60cm(2) (0.3%). Lesion recovery was high (83%), but 11.2% did not recover or grow. On 2.5% algae invasion was seen. Bleaching lesions affected more ramet area (>60% of its live tissue) and were evident from September to November, yet total recovery was found in three months. In contrast, lesions by algae (36%), showed less recovery (6.7%), and a tendency to grow in time. In general, percentage of affected tissue area of a ramet in any month was lower than 10%. Nevertheless from May to September, the area affected was larger (10-50%) due to an increase in frequency and abundance of predation, bleaching and algal damage, and a decrease in recovery. At the end of the year, lesions that did not recover caused partial mortality in 25% of the ramets.

Surveys of coral reefs in northern Tanzania were conducted in 2004/5 with the aim of comparing them over an similar to 8-year period during a time of increased efforts at fisheries management and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) coral mortality event that caused 45% mortality in northern Tanzania and much of the Indian Ocean.2. Changes associated with both management, its absence, and the ENSO were found but changes were generally small and ecological measures indicated stability or improvements over this period, particularly when compared with reports from much of the northern Indian Ocean.3. Fisheries management in two areas increased the biomass of fish and benthic communities. A small fisheries closure (0.3 km(2)) displayed little change in the coral community but ecological conditions declined as measured by sea urchins and fish abundances. This change may be associated with its small size because similar changes were not measured in the large closure (28 km(2)).4. The few sites without any increased management were still degraded and one site had experienced a population explosion of a pest sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei.5. The lack of significant changes across this disturbance indicates that these reefs are moderately resilient to climate change and, therefore, a high priority for future conservation actions.

We studied the size-structure of two contrasting populations of M. annularis (degraded and less-degraded reef) in a Marine Protected Area in Cartagena, Colombia, to evaluate its current state and infer its persistence in the future. Colony size frequency distribution of 102 colonies and 9646 ramets on a logarithmic scale was negatively skewed in both populations, but larger colonies were found in the less-degraded reef. Ramet size frequency distribution was positively skewed and dominated by individuals smaller than 50 cm(2) (similar to 76% in the degraded vs 57% in the less-degraded reef). Partial and total mortality differed between the populations (27% vs 16%; 10% vs 16%, respectively). Colony and ramet size in the degraded reef were smaller due to greater partial mortality and fission. In conclusion, large, old colonies are present in both populations, but experience high partial mortality that causes high fission rates and therefore a dominance of small, non-reproductive ramets.

Climate change models suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching events, with consequent increases in coral mortality and algal overgrowth. Critically, the recovery of damaged reefs will depend on the reversibility of seaweed blooms, generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed, and replenishment of corals by larvae that successfully recruit to damaged reefs. These processes usually take years to decades to bring a reef back to coral dominance.Methodology/Principal Findings: In 2006, mass bleaching of corals on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality. Here we show that this coral mortality was followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single species of unpalatable seaweed (Lobophora variegata), colonizing dead coral skeletons, but that corals on these reefs recovered dramatically, in less than a year. Unexpectedly, this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of corals by recruitment of coral larvae, as often assumed, but depended on several ecological mechanisms previously underestimated.Conclusions/Significance: These mechanisms of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rates of remnant coral tissue, very high competitive ability of the corals allowing them to out-compete the seaweed, a natural seasonal decline in the particular species of dominant seaweed, and an effective marine protected area system.

Here we report on a combined remote-operated vehicle, SCUBA and baited trap study, backed by regular oxygen-temperature-depth monitoring of the Trough. Our results show that there is community of resident benthic and mobile species during the oxic winter months that disappears in the summer. Mobile fish and crustaceans avoid the hypoxic areas of the Trough, though the prawn Palaemon serratus will venture into the hypoxic zone to scavenge on baits. At the oxy-thermocline itself, burrows of benthic fauna remain evident in summer, but their inhabitants show much reduced activity or death. Regular hypoxic episodes clearly structure the benthic community of the Trough, but this is not a simple matter of alternating mass mortality and recolonization: mobile species are clearly capable of avoiding the hypoxic zone in summer, but benefit from its productivity in winter and spring.

Lobsters outside the reserve were significantly more affected by tail fan necrosis than lobsters within the reserve, with up to 17% of the males caught outside the reserve over a 3-year period showing signs of tail fan necrosis, compared with less than 2% within the reserve. The incidence of tail fan necrosis changed abruptly at the marine reserve boundaries, strongly implying repeated handling as the causal agent. The incidence of tail fan necrosis in males increased up to the minimum legal size, consistent with a handling effect. Female lobsters, which comprise only a small proportion of the catch in this area, were comparatively unaffected by tail fan necrosis. There was no significant difference in the recapture rates of individuals tagged either with or without tail fan necrosis, but tagged individuals outside the reserve were more likely to develop tail fan necrosis than tagged individuals within the reserve. These findings have implications for both the dynamics of the lobster populations and their management, and highlight the role of marine protected areas in providing a baseline against which such effects of fishing can be assessed.",19,2009,10.1071/MF08091,WOS:000263526300004,field,CI,2003-2006,MPA,Te Tapuwae o Rongokako,7,medium,1999,fully,24.52,24.52,medium,NA,New Zealand,subtropical,Oceania,Pacific,mix,invertebrate,Jasus edwardsii,fished,yes,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,health degradation,disease prevalence,figure 2,positive,yes,decimal number,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Four years after this event, Frontier-Tanzania assessed reef substrate in Misali Island Marine Conservation Area (MIMCA) using scuba surveys. Substrate cover was compared between sites within and outside the nonextraction zone (NEZ) of MIMCA and recovery rates were estimated through reference to previous studies. Coral recovery at Misali Island following the bleaching event has generally been slow, but nonextractive management of MIMCA has enhanced coral recovery within the NEZ. The absence of fishing activities in the NEZ has sustained herbivorous fish populations and thus reduced algal overgrowth; however, outside the NEZ, diving and anchoring activities have caused further coral damage and led to increased levels of debris. Awareness-raising programmes could lessen these problems and the NEZ appeared to be well-placed to capitalize on nonmanageable factors that are thought to mitigate the effects of coral bleaching. In addition, the implementation of flexible zoning schemes could improve recovery rates after future bleaching events.",1,2008,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00873.x,WOS:000261243500003,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,NA,bleaching,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Water temperatures at BIRNM in 2005 were higher than at any time since at least 1991, and exceeded the bleaching threshold by over 2 degrees C, causing extensive coral bleaching. Forty-four A. palmata colonies at three sites in BIRNM were sampled before, during, and after the thermal stress event. Additionally, colonies at randomly located sites on the reef shelf were surveyed to extend results over a larger portion of BIRNM; these colonies were surveyed during and after the thermal stress event. Acropora palmata colonies located in the backreef benthic zone exhibited a different response to the thermal stress event than those located elsewhere in BIRNM: backreef colonies bleached earlier and suffered greater tissue loss than those located elsewhere. We hypothesized that increased water temperature coupled with reduced water flow and increased light penetration caused higher mortality in backreef locations. Since A. palmata in the backreef benthic zone is least resistant and resilient to thermal stress events, backreef areas are a poor focal area for A. palmata marine protected areas.",6,2008,,WOS:000260894200001,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

This study supports the processes regarding the fishery management of P. penicillatus by determining its distribution and growth parameters. Nearly 3,000 lobsters were tagged during surveys carried out at 13 islands between 2000 and 2004.

Monitoring over 32-years did not reveal increasing or decreasing trends in red abalone abundances and sizes over the past three decades, in the absence of harvesting. Comparisons between marine reserves protected for at least 25 years and sites with open public access showed significant difference in size structure for black abalone, with individuals greater than 8 cm in shell length comprising 14-37% of animals in reserves and 2-11% at open-access sites, and a trend for greater abundances of red abalone within reserves. Despite no increasing trends, protection in one of the no-take reserves, the Hopkins marine life refuge (HMLR), has led to persistence of red abalone populations over multiple generations, at average densities of 0.2 individuals/m(2). At other locations, both within the HMLR and elsewhere, red abalone densities are lower than at the location where long-term studies were conducted (av. 0.03 animals/m(2)), and an order of magnitude lower than for black abalone (av. 0.4 animals/m(2)). These results suggest that continued fishery closure and protection in no-take reserves are effective tools for allowing persistence of abalone populations, though there are no signs of recovery to levels comparable to those preceding fisheries collapse. Such failure to recover is most likely associated with high natural mortality and possibly continued illegal take, but not with processes underlying low abalone population levels elsewhere, including food or habitat limitation, recruitment failure, or disease. Linking current structure and trends to specific processes is a crucial first step towards devising focused strategies for conserving and re-building depleted marine populations.

For example, in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles' competitors, overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the over fished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no-take reserve. Ignoring community interactions, the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However, after incorporating community interactions, the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model, the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species, and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible.",36,2006,10.1139/F06-013,WOS:000238285700003,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

This topic merits investigation because it can influence the outcome of reproduction, competition and predation, and thereby affect the viability of populations. In this study, a nested sampling design was used to assess differences in density and biomass of seven species of patellid limpets at the scales of plots, sites and shores inside and outside a marine protected area (MPA) on the southeast coast of South Africa. At the scale of plots, significant variation was more common inside than outside the MPA. This probably reflects differences in the general pattern of space occupancy and quality of habitats available to limpets inside and outside the MPA. Significant variation at the scale of sites was rare. This suggests that either the processes contributing to variability at this scale counteract each other or that the sites were similar in terms of habitats and ecological processes. At the scale of shores, significant variation was more common in densities than in biomass, but both occurred with equal frequency inside and outside the MPA. Variation at this scale is probably driven by a combination of recruitment and/or mortality. Five species exhibited greater spatial variability inside than outside the MPA. The spatial patterns observed did not appear to be linked with differences in the mobility, habitat requirements or susceptibility of these species to exploitation. The lack of consistent patterns suggests that each species probably responds in a different way to the ecological processes operating at these spatial scales.",10,2006,10.1093/mollus/eyi058,WOS:000237321000002,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Population growth parameters of L-infinity = 120.38 mm and K = 0.9668 were obtained using marking and recapture methods. The high recapture percentage (60-80%) of marked individuals indicates a low natural rate of mortality, as well as a sedentary behavior. Annual population estimates confirmed the sedentary behavior of the scallops, with most of the individuals concentrating towards the center of the bed at densities between 9-14.8 ind m(-2). Scallop abundance showed interannual variation, with total individual counts similar to 10. 1 x 10(6) in 2001, 8.2 x 10(6) in 2002, and 12.4 x 10(6) in 2003. Evaluations showed a reduction in mean size within the population from one year to the next, the mean length of 75.8 mm in 2001 decreasing to 62.1 mm in 2002 and to 51.7 mm in 2003. This decrease also occurred in the number of individuals of legal extraction size (90 mm), from 2.6 x 10(6) individuals in 2001 to 3.7 x 10(5) in 2003. Application of the growth parameters to the population structure in the bed showed recruitment of a new year-class of 6.5 x 10(6) individuals in 2002 and 11.2 x 10(6) in 2003. Subtraction of these numbers from the total numbers present in both years showed losses of about 8.4 x 10(6) individuals in 2002 and 7.0 x 10(6) in 2003. Based on the population growth parameters and supported by analysis of the catch curve using the Fisat program, these losses concerned the size range of scallops over 60 mm in length with a mortality Z = 2.15 in 2002 for individuals ranging from 67.5 to 115.5 mm in length and Z = 3.08 in 2003 for those ranging from 64.3 to 112.5 mm.

Marine protected areas are increasingly being recommended as an essential component of the management of exploited marine species, but virtually no attention has been given to the influence of parasites. This may be substantial, as a primary effect of marine reserves is to increase the density of an exploited population within the reserve relative to outside the reserve, which may facilitate parasite transmission.2. We used a simple deterministic model of microparasitic infection in a fishery with a reserve to investigate equilibrium yield and parasite prevalence inside and outside the reserve as a function of three control variables: the proportion of habitat inside the reserve, fishing mortality and the rate of interchange between the stock and the reserve.3. While our model is generic, we parameterized it with values that may be appropriate to the interaction between abalone and Rickettsia.4. The presence of a pathogen does not necessarily decrease yield when a reserve is present, particularly if the rate of movement of adult hosts between stock and reserve is low.5. Synthesis and applications. Pathogens have important implications for the design of marine reserves. Our modelling identifies two key considerations. First, 'fishing out' a pathogen by reducing the host population density to a level below the threshold for disease maintenance is a potential management strategy that is made more difficult by establishing a reserve. Secondly, the effect of a highly transmissible pathogen without a reserve is to cause a rapid decline in equilibrium yield for efforts beyond those that produce maximum sustainable yield, making the fishery prone to collapse. Introducing a reserve decreases yield in this case, but makes the fishery much more resistant to collapse.",42,2005,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01043.x,WOS:000230602100009,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Because earlier maturation negatively affects biomass yield and sustainability, ignoring evolutionary changes could significantly reduce the success of fisheries management policy. With a quantitative genetic model of size at maturation that incorporates phenotype plasticity, we examine the impact of different management strategies including traditional effort control and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). After verifying the model's accuracy, using historical trajectories for size at maturation in cod (Gadus morhua), we test model predictions under different management schemes with life history parameters for red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and two rockfish species (Sebastes paucispinis and S. ruberrimus). The model results show that no-take MPAs can protect against strong fisheries-based selection for earlier maturation. The potential to protect against anthropogenic selection declines with increasing fragmentation of reserves to networks of small reserves. Accounting for the evolution of size at maturation increases the predicted biomass contribution from MPA populations to harvested populations. Traditional management approaches, such as adjustments to harvest rate and maximum size limits, can lead to equivalent protection against anthropogenic selection and equivalent or greater long-term biomass yield than establishing MPAs; however, the protection and yield from establishing no-take MPAs appears more robust to uncertainty.",103,2005,10.1890/04-0723,WOS:000229723400010,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

We surgically implanted acoustic tags in a total of 83 lingcod in December 1999 and July 2000, and distributed recording monitors with receiving ranges of at least 800 m throughout the reserve. The receivers were anchored on the seafloor in locations that resulted in overlapping receiving ranges, and thus created an array of receivers that completely encompassed an 8 km2 reserve. In this way, we were able to estimate natural mortality rates and track movements of tagged lingcod into and out of the reserve from December 1999 through October 2001. Acoustic tag results indicated that most of the tagged fish frequently left the reserve, but were only absent for short time periods. Tagged fish showed a high degree of site fidelity.

Sectioned otoliths showed that L. fulviflamma in the MIMP attained a maximum age of 18 years, with a high proportion of fish between 6 and 10 years old. The maximum age was 8 years in the intensively fished areas, with a preponderance of 2- and 4-year-old fish.

This study details the dynamics of a population of great scallops Pecten maximus (L.), within a closed area and an adjacent fished area off the Isle of Man, over a 14 yr period (1989 to 2003). Scallop densities were very low in both areas when the closed area was set up, but increased at an accelerated rate over time within the closed area. Scallop densities also increased on the adjacent fishing ground, but not to the same extent. Consequently, the density of scallops above the minimum legal landing size (110 mm SL) was more than 7 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003. There was also a shift towards much older and larger scallops in the closed area and, correspondingly, lower estimates of total mortality. Experimental dredging of 2 plots within the closed area confirmed that fishing drove these differences in population dynamics and structure. These patterns of scallop density, age and size structure resulted in the exploitable biomass (adductor muscle and gonad) of scallops being nearly 11 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003, and the reproductive biomass was 12.5 times higher. This is significant for fisheries management because the build up of high densities of large P. maximus individuals enhanced local reproductive potential and therefore the likelihood of export of larvae to the surrounding fishing grounds. Along with these direct benefits of closed area protection, juvenile scallops had higher survival and individual growth rates in the closed area, apparently in response to reduced fishing disturbance. Although juvenile scallops are not subject to direct removal by fishing, protection during this critical phase therefore appeared to assist the recovery of the closed area population. In summary, this study joins a growing number indicating that the use of closed areas offers a range of benefits over more traditional methods of managing fisheries.

Coral disease and bleaching in the Caribbean and South Florida have caused extensive coral mortality with limited recovery, often coral reefs are being replaced with turf algae. Acroporids were once dominant corals and have diminished to the state where they are being considered as endangered species. Our survey assessed the condition of reef corals throughout South Florida. A probability- based design produced unbiased estimates of the spatial extent of ecological condition, measured as the absence or presence and frequency or prevalence of coral diseases and bleaching intensity over large geographic regions. This approach allowed us to calculate a quantifiable level of uncertainty. Coral condition was estimated for 4100 hectares ( ha) (or 41.0 km(2)) of coral reefs in South Florida, including reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary ( FKNMS), New Grounds, Dry Tortugas National Park ( DTNP), and Biscayne National Park (BNP). The absence or presence of coral disease, 'causal' coral bleaching, partial bleaching and coral paling were not good indicators of overall coral condition. It was more useful to report the prevalence of anomalies that indicated a compromised condition at both the population and community levels. For example, 79% of the area in South Florida had less than 6% of the coral colonies diseased, whereas only 2.2% (97.15 ha) of the sampled area had a maximum prevalence of 13% diseased coral colonies at any single location. The usefulness of 'causal bleaching' might be more important when considering the prevalence of each of the three different states at a single location. For example, paling was observed over the entire area, whereas bleaching and partial bleaching occurred at 19 and 41% of the area, respectively. An index for coral reef condition might integrate the prevalence and species affected by each bleaching state at individual locations. By establishing these baselines, future surveys can examine changes and trends in the spatial distribution of coral conditions in South Florida and able to score the reefs as to their health status.",21,2005,10.1007/s10661-005-4767-6,WOS:000226970300010,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

We find that under the conditions of variability tested, reserves can increase the probability of achieving target levels of biomass (60%, 35%, and 5% of carrying capacity) and can reduce catch variability in neighbouring fisheries, making future planning in the fishery more efficient. The size of the reserve required to meet each objective will depend on the initial condition of the stock and the exploitation rate in the fishery. Reserve coverage of between 20% and 40% prevent stock collapse in most cases. In heavily exploited fisheries, reserves are also likely to enhance mean catches, particularly in highly variable systems. If the stock has previously been heavily exploited, large reserves (greater than or equal to60%) may be required to significantly increase the probability of achieving target biomass levels.

However, protected areas tend to attract more tourism and associated recreational activities, thereby exposing the biota to new risks such as high diving activity. The effects of these drawbacks are still little known for low-dynamic systems such as one of the most characteristic and fragile Mediterranean communities, the coralligenous community. Mortality rates were assessed in both heavily dived and lightly dived areas to evaluate the effect of diving on the survival of the gorgonian Paramuricea clavata. The study was designed to distinguish human-induced causes from natural causes of gorgonian mortality and to provide criteria for sustainable management of protected areas. We examined total and partial mortality of adult colonies (>10 cm in height) at four locations, two each representing one of the two situations, heavily dived (MPA) and lightly dived (control), annually over a 9-yr period (1992-2000).High levels of recreational activity did not affect the degree of injury of the colonies. On average, the proportion of live tissue of the colonies remained steady at similar to91%. Colony death by detachment was the main source of mortality at the MPA, four times higher than death due to overgrowth. Mortality rate due to overgrowth remained constant at both areas with an average of 1.2%/yr. Natural mortality rate in sites with low diving activity was estimated to be about 2.7%/yr, whereas high diving activity was estimated to increase the natural mortality rate of the species by a factor of three, up to similar to7.4%/yr.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an emerging tool to cope with such threats. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, large MPAs (covering 31% of all intertidal flats) have been created to protect shellfish-eating birds and allow recovery of important habitats. Even though shellfish fishing is prohibited in these areas, populations of shellfish-eating birds in the Wadden Sea have declined sharply. The role of shellfish fisheries in these declines is hotly debated, therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of MPAs for protecting oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) populations. Shellfish stocks (cockles, Cerastoderma edule) were substantially higher in the MPAs, but surprisingly this has not resulted in a redistribution of wintering oystercatchers. Oystercatchers in unprotected areas had less shellfish in their diet and lower condition (a combined measure of mass and haematological parameters), and their estimated mortality was 43% higher. It is likely, therefore, that shellfish fishing explains at least part of the 40% decline in oystercatcher numbers in recent years. Condition and mortality effects were strongest in males, and the population sex ratio was female biased, in agreement with the fact that males rely more on shellfish. The unprotected areas apparently function as an ecological trap, because oystercatchers did not respond as anticipated to the artificial spatial heterogeneity in food supply. Consequently, the MPAs are effective on a local scale, but not on a global scale. Similar problems are likely to exist in terrestrial ecosystems, and distribution strategies of target species need to be considered when designing terrestrial and marine protected areas if they are to be effective.",56,2004,,WOS:000228025100012,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Fewer studies have evaluated the indirect effects of this build-up, such as the influence on recruitment and survivorship, of young fishes. Higher predation pressures in marine protected areas should lead to lower post-settlement survival rates of newly recruited fishes as well as higher selective mortalities. For example, surviving recruits in these areas may exhibit traits such as faster growth rates and larger sizes-at-age than elsewhere. Due to the constraints of testing these hypotheses in marine protected areas (e.g. permit restrictions, confounding environmental variables), mesocosm tanks were constructed in order to run experimental trials in a controlled setting.

This suggests plasticity in the age of sexual inversion in the case of an exploited population. Genetic differentiation was weak and apparent at only one locus of 26 surveyed (F-ST = 0.007, p = 0.04). Our data suggest that gene flow between the two areas is important, or the separation between the two sites is recent. Our data on the white sea bream show that fishes inside and outside the marine reserve are very similar genetically, Which means that the 'reserve effect' is truly a demographic one, not the result of genetic differences.

Efforts to conserve Posidonia oceanica arc increasing, as reflected in the increase in the number of marine protected areas in the Mediterranean. However, the effectiveness of these measures to conserve seagrass meadows is unknown. In this study, the present status of the Posidonia oceanica meadows in the Cabrera National Park (Mediterranean), the only marine national park in Spain, was assessed, and the effectiveness of the conservation measures adopted was tested. This was done by reconstruction of past and present growth, quantification of the demographic status of the established meadows, and quantification of patch formation and growth rates in areas where recolonization is occurring. The meadows extended from 1-43 in deep at Santa Maria bay and from 1-33 m at Es Port. Leaf production rate of the stands examined ranged between 6.5 and 7.8 leaves shoot(-1) yr(-1), with higher rates in Santa Maria than in Es Port. Vertical rhizomes elongated at rates ranging from 5.39-10.12 mm yr(-1), annual vertical growth in Santa Maria stands being larger than that in the stands developing at Es Port. Horizontal rhizomes elongated slowly (from 2.6-6.1 cm yr(-1)), and branching was sparse (<0.25 branches yr(-1) axis(-1)), with maximum elongation and branching rates in areas where patches were actively colonizing. Flowering was a rare event in all the stands (<0.015 flowers shoot(-1) yr(-1)). Patch formation and patch growth rates in active colonizing areas were slow, but they increased after implementation of mooring regulations in the Park. Similarly, the leaf production tended to increase, and vertical rhizome growth to decrease, in both bays following the onset of regulation measures. However, the decrease in vertical growth detected was greater at Santa Maria, where access is prohibited to visitors, than at Es Port, where boats are allowed to moor, attached to permanent weights. Shoot mortality rate was generally low (mean 0.10 +/- 0.02 ln units yr(-1)) but exceeded the recruitment rate (<0.009 and 0.17 ln units yr(-1)) in 55% of the meadows examined, indicative of negative net population growth rates. Regulation of mooring activities has improved the status of the P. oceanica meadows at Cabrera National Park. The demographic analysis, however, indicated that while P. oceanica meadows at Santa Maria are in good shape, those at Es Port seem to be compromised. The observed differences in meadow status reflect the large differences in circulation inside the bays (water residence time at Santa Maria = 4 days, water residence time at Es Port = 11 days) and the anthropogenic pressure both bays support.",78,2002,10.1017/S037689290200036X,WOS:000182033200008,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Remediation was attempted: hard and soft corals were transplanted to part of one impact area shortly after the accident, debris was removed from part of another, and the substrate was repaired with cast concrete forms at the third area. Few fishes are found immediately after such impacts., but fishes should return to impacted sites along with other life, recovering to resemble either assemblages characteristic of complex reefs, or assemblages of simpler hard ground habitat. During 1995 and 1996, fishes were surveyed at five impact sites dispersed among the three impact areas., three spur-and-groove sites, four natural hard ground sites, and a hard ground site where ships had grounded 100 yrs ago. Patterns of species composition were explored through cluster analysis; diversities and overall abundances of fishes were compared among sites, with subsequent comparisons of paired remediated and unremediated sites. Irrespective of initial structural complexity of a grounding site, fish assemblages converged to low diversity, low abundance assemblages with species composition typical of natural hard ground. A preponderance of opportunistic wrasses that eat post-larval invertebrates, combined with a lack of large parrotfishes, may prevent recovery of such structurally impoverished sites to a well-developed spur-and-groove formation by hindering recolonization by corals. The remediation efforts seemed ineffective, except that replacing major topographic features may enhance fish species diversity.",5,2001,,WOS:000172609000035,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Mean asymptotic test diameter, standard deviation of asymptotic test diameter, growth rate coefficient, and natural mortality rate were first estimated for three nominally unharvested sites, Bodega Marine Reserve, Caspar Closure, and Salt Point. These estimated growth and mortality parameters differed among sites, leading to substantially different yield-per-recruit surfaces. Estimates of fishing mortality rate from size distributions collected at 11 harvested sites were then calculated based on the growth and natural mortality estimates obtained from the Caspar Closure and Bodega Marine Reserve sites. Estimates of fishing mortality rate ranged from 0.11 to 1.87.year(-1). The alongshore pattern of fishing mortality rate was moderately correlated with landings and effort, but the spatial pattern of rare, strong recruitment events also appeared to influence values of fishing mortality rate. The positive bias in estimates of fishing mortality rate due to recruitment variability indicated that our observed pattern in estimated values for fishing mortality rate could have been caused by the historical spatial pattern of interannual variability in recruitment.",30,2000,10.1139/cjfas-57-5-980,WOS:000087273200010,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Strong size-selective mortality from fishing has promoted an earlier age and smaller size at maturity in many species and a concomitant reduction in subsequent adult body sizes. These attributes are less economically desirable than those of fish from less heavily exploited stocks. We attempted to determine whether the establishment of marine protected areas, and the resulting relaxation of the directional selection produced by fishing mortality, would promote a substantial restoration of later ages at maturity. Our quantitative genetic models, calibrated with historical data from Gulf of Mexico populations of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, indicated that adequate variation should remain for life-history traits like age at maturity to respond to new fitness profiles. Marine species with planktonic larvae, including most economically important fishes, have high gene-flow rates that will preclude genetic differentiation between the no-take MPAs and the rest of the population. Any changes in the life history that are promoted by the no-take area may therefore ramify through the entire population. The establishment of no-take MPAs will promote substantial increases in the age at maturity if recruitment into them is not limited by density-dependent mortality. If it is, the benefit of no-take areas for increasing the age at maturity will be decreased. The no-take MPAs must serve as the major source of recruits for nearby fishing areas to produce the proposed benefits. The creation of MPAs will not replace the benefits of limiting age or size biases in harvesting by traditional fisheries management.",34,2000,,WOS:000088894300023,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,
191,out,out,out,NA,WoS,.,J,,"Jennings, S",Patterns and prediction of population recovery in marine reserves,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,.,"Marine reserves (no-take zones) are widely recommended as conservation and fishery management tools. One potential benefit of marine reserves is that they can reduce fishing mortality. This can lead to increases in the abundance of spawners, providing insurance against recruitment failure and maintaining or enhancing yields in fished areas. This paper considers the factors that influence recovery following marine reserve protection, describes patterns of recovery in numbers and biomass, and suggests how recovery rates can be predicted. Population recovery is determined by initial population size, the intrinsic rate of population increase r, and the degree of compensation (increases in recruits per spawner as spawner abundance falls) or depensation (lower than expected recruitment at low abundance, Allee effect) in the spawner-recruit relationship. Within a reserve, theoretical recovery rates are further modified by metapopulation structure and the success of individual recruitment events. Recovery also depends on the extent of reductions in fishing mortality (F) as determined by the relationship between patterns of movement, migration, and density-dependent habitat use (buffer effect) in relation to the size, shape and location of the reserve. The effects of reductions in F on population abundance have been calculated using a variety of models that incorporate transfer rates between the reserve and fished areas, fishing mortality outside the reserve and life history parameters of the population. These models give useful indications of increases in production and biomass (as yield per recruit and spawners per recruit respectively) due to protection, but do not address recruitment. Many reserves are very small in relation to the geographical range of fish or invertebrate populations. In these reserves it may be impossible to distinguish recovery due to population growth from that due to redistribution. Mean rates of recovery can be predicted from r, but the methods are data intensive. This is ironic when marine reserves are often favoured for management or conservation in data-poor situations where conventional stock assessment is impossible. In these data-poor situations, it may be possible to predict recovery rates from very low population sizes by using maximum body size or age at maturity as simple correlates of the intrinsic rate of natural increase.",169,2000,10.1023/A:1016619102955,WOS:000168058800004,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Summers are hot and wet, winters cold and dry and this study was initiated to determine the effects of bioerosion and periodic episodes of strong wave action on coral death and beaching. Coral rubble washed up on Telecom Bay Beach in the Cape d'Aguilar Marine Reserve was collected every month from January 1996 until December 1997, inclusive. Quantities were greatest after typhoons and storms, with the average monthly weight of recently-living corals accounting for approximately 0.007%, by weight. of the total live coral in the bay. Seventeen species of Mollusca were recorded from within the skeletons of this rubble and included a new record for Hong Kong, Anchomasa yoshimurai (Pholadidae). Species of Lithophaga dominated, with highest mean abundances recorded from within Goniastrea aspera, the most abundant living coral in the bay and from within the heaviest fragments. The overall incidence of borers was, however, low although it appears that dead coral borers, notably the basally boring Lithophaga lima, act to weaken coral attachment resulting in dislodgement and beaching during and after storms. At this relatively unperturbated site, therefore, the significance of borers in weakening coral attachment with subsequent detachment and beaching during and after storms, respectively; is low a situation also seen elsewhere.",11,1999,10.1017/S0025315498000988,WOS:000083210200003,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Such gradients may be affected by other factors, however, including differences in habitat quality between reserve and non-reserve areas and the movement of fish across reserve boundaries. To examine the effects of protection from fishing mortality and of habitat quality on an assemblage of exploited reef fishes, we measured the spatial patterns of fish density and size on fringing reefs near the boundary of the Barbados Marine Reserve (Barbados, West Indies) and statistically controlled for habitat correlates of fish density and size. Reserve sites supported a higher total density and size of fishes than non-reserve sites. Most species had a non-significantly higher mean density and size at reserve sites. The density and/or size of many species were correlated with the depth, rugosity, and/or substrate composition of sites. After statistically controlling for the effects of habitat correlates, the difference in total density between reserve and non-reserve sites remained significant, and the mean density and size of most species remained nonsignificantly higher at reserve sites. Neither the mobility of species nor their vulnerability to capture by Antillean fish traps was correlated with their relative difference in density or size between reserve and non-reserve sites. Spearfishing target species had a significantly higher relative difference in size between reserve and non-reserve sites than non-target species. Protection from fishing mortality and higher habitat quality appear to contribute to the increased density and size of fishes on study reefs in the Barbados Marine Reserve, and this difference is not compromised by emigration from the reserve.",129,1999,10.3354/meps181081,WOS:000080772700007,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,phenotypic,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,

Eight stations were located in protected areas and 13 in unprotected zones. Declines in abundance in all 3 species were particularly marked in the first month after settlement. Patterns of survivorship indicated that the 3 species were subject to density-dependent mortality from settlement to recruitment to the adult population. The effect of this mortality pattern was to reduce the variability in year-class strength, though without changing the rank order of abundance between years. The mortality rates for D. sargus were higher than for D. puntazzo and D. vulgaris.

No significant differences in the growth rate of C. laticeps were measured, but growth in C. cristiceps was significantly slower in the exploited population. Observed data showed that sex ratios outside the marine reserve were skewed towards the females, a result of size selective exploitation. Size at sex change was also significantly smaller for C. cristiceps in the exploited area, but not so for C. laticeps. This difference between the species was explained as a function of the size at recruitment into the fishery and the degree of protection afforded both large females and male fish.

The monitored areas included two photostations in the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, two photostations in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, and two photostations in the Biscayne National Park. Stations were monitored for species number, percent cover, and species diversity of the scleractinian and hydrozoan stony corals. Monitoring began in 1984 for photostations in the National Marine Sanctuaries and in 1989 for stations in the National Park.All six areas lost coral species between the initial survey year and 1991. Survey areas lost between one and four species; these losses constituted between 13% and 29% of their species richness. Five of the six areas lost live coral cover. Based upon photographs taken repeatedly at these locations, net losses ranged between 7.3% and 43.9%. In the one station showing an increase in coral cover, the increase was only for the canopy branches of Acropora palmata; understory branches of this same species lost surface area at the same rate as canopy branches gained area. For most of the common species, there was a reduction in the total number of living colonies in the community, and a diminution in the number of large, mature colonies. Throughout the study period, there was no recruitment to any of the photostations by any of the massive frame building coral species.Mortality of this magnitude is often associated with hurricane damage, but in this survey the losses occurred during a period without catastrophic storms. Sources of mortality identifiable in the photographs include (1) black band disease and (2) ''bleaching''; other potential sources of mortality are also considered.
