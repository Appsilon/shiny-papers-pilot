Although the conservation area is recognized as both an area of special biological significance and a marine life refuge, species richness of the nearshore taxa from this location is not known. In this study, we provide a comprehensive inventory of the intertidal and subtidal marine macroalgae, plants, invertebrates, and fishes documented from 5 different reef sites inside Blue Cavern Onshore SMCA. Species richness data were compiled using scuba-based visual surveys conducted in the field, references from the primary and gray literature, research collections maintained by scholarly institutions, and field monitoring programs. The total number of marine taxa documented in this study (765 species from 17 major phylogenetic groups) represents 63% of the estimated species richness in Blue Cavern Onshore SMCA and is indicative of the high biodiversity known from this region. Specifically, the intertidal and subtidal biota reported here represent 34% and 18% of the marine taxa known from Catalina Island and the Southern California Bight, respectively. Incidences of the introduction of exotic and invasive organisms (n = 18), changes in the geographic distributions of species (n = 14), as well as marine taxa listed as species of concern, endangered, or critically endangered (n = 4), were also identified in the current inventory.

A.",Reef fish biomass recovery within community-managed no take zones,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,"Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are increasingly recognised as a key strategy for small-scale fisheries management across the Indo-Pacific. When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the biological effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.Importantly, these CMNTZs delivered a conservation benefit that rivals government-run NTZs in the region, against a backdrop of severe biomass depletion, coastal poverty and human dependence on fishing-illustrating their suitability as a solution to marine resource depletion in developing tropical countries.",3,2020,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105210,WOS:000534266700011,field,BACI,2015,LMMA,Velondriake,6,medium,2009,FPA,fully,0.18,0.18,small,yes,Madagascar,tropical,Africa,West Indian Ocean,coral reef,,ecological,fish,,,,,co-managed,,biodiversity,,species richness,Figure 7,neutral,yes,ratio MPA/control,95% confidence interval,17.1,30,0.15,46.75063111,20.7,30,0.15,46.75063111,15.3,6.00,0.23,14.93487058,17,6.00,0.23,14.93487058,0.085694721,0.70661555,,,"check the variance, BACI design, each MPA value was calculated as the grand mean of the 6 transect values within each site that has been closed long enough to test the closure effect after the corresponding number of years."

However, it has endured historical fishery exploitation prior to protective efforts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fish assemblages of the archipelago from an ecological and functional diversity perspective in order to test the hypothesis that the low live coral cover, reduced habitat complexity, and overfishing have decreased the biological, ecological, and functional diversity of fish. Our results indicate that the fish assemblages have a high species richness and ecological diversity, compared with other reefs of the MBRS. The sub-massive corals sustain the fish ecological and functional diversity, while leafy corals were associated with low functional diversity. Also, we identified sites with fish assemblages that are in good condition (e.g., Roatan Bank), which can be considered to be a control point for the evaluation of other sites within this MPA. Unfortunately, we also identified sites that were overexploited (e.g., Salamandinga), with low live coral cover and reduced habitat complexity, which also generated a low ecological and functional diversity. This study highlights a functional approach to evaluate fish assemblage conservation in MPAs.

For marine fish, marine protected areas (MPAs) often harbour more individuals, especially of species targeted by fisheries. But precise pathways of biodiversity change remain unclear. For example, how local-scale responses combine to affect regional biodiversity, important for managing spatial networks of MPAs, is not well known. Protection potentially influences three components of fish assemblages that determine how species accumulate with sampling effort and spatial scale: the total number of individuals, the relative abundance of species and within-species aggregation. Here, we examined the contributions of each component to species richness changes inside MPAs as a function of spatial scale. Using standardized underwater visual survey data, we measured the abundance and species richness of reef fishes in 43 protected and 41 fished sites in the Mediterranean Sea. At both local and regional scales, increased species evenness caused by added common species in MPAs compared to fished sites was the most important proximate driver of higher diversity. Site-to-site variation in the composition (i.e. beta-diversity) of common species was also higher among protected sites, and depended on sensitivity to exploitation. There were more abundant exploited species at regional scales than at local scales, reflecting a tendency for different protected sites to harbour different exploited species. In contrast, fewer abundant unexploited species were found at the regional scale than at the local scale, meaning that relative abundances at the regional scale were less even than at the local scale. Synthesis and applications. Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are known to strongly influence fish community abundance and biomass, we found that changes to the relative abundance of species (i.e. increased evenness) dominated the biodiversity response to protection. MPAs had more relatively common species, which in turn led to higher diversity for a given sampling effort. Moreover, higher beta-diversity of common species meant that local-scale responses were magnified at the regional scale due to site-to-site variation inside protected areas for exploited species. Regional conservation efforts can be strengthened by examining how multiple components of biodiversity respond to protection across spatial scales.",6,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13549,WOS:000505754700001,field,CI,2008,MPA,Mix,NA,NA,NA,mix,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean sea,rocky reef,,ecological,fish,,mix,,,NA,,biodiversity,,species richness,Results 3.1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no error raw, only 95%quantiles"

I studied the biomass and species richness of 24 fish families at 238 unique sites in Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. I identified an unfished benchmark that was associated with high biomass, high-compliance closures or low access to fishing along with 6 additional statistically different communities. In the benchmark community, biomass was dominated by snappers, surgeonfish, parrotfish, and wrasses. Of the 24 families studied, 11 declined relative to the benchmark community, with the greatest declines observed among surgeonfish, snappers, sweetlips (grunts), groupers, and triggerfish. I evaluated the community's spatial distributions and associations of 15 of 23 environmental and human-impact variables. Fish biomass was most positively influenced by the extent of shallow water < 50 m adjacent to the sites, depth, and high-compliance closures and negatively impacted by human populations within a 100 km radius of the site. Number of fish species was largely predicted by biomass with weak evidence for local environmental control. Classification of the biomass into 3 proposed management thresholds revealed that similar to 38% of the sites were below sustainable yields, 54% were below maximum species richness, and 92% below a proposed stable-ecosystem or conservation threshold. Therefore, increasing biomass of vulnerable taxa through fishing restrictions is recommended for maintaining sustainable fisheries, species diversity, and ecosystem services.",3,2019,10.3354/meps13153,WOS:000521189100012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no mention of MPA, no value of interest"

Ecosystem-based management and area closures are considered an effective way to maintain ecological processes, especially in marine systems. Although there is strong evidence that such measures positively affect community structure, their impact on the rate of key ecological processes remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that marine protected areas enhance herbivory rates on coral reefs via direct and indirect pathways. Using meta-analysis and a path-analytical framework, we demonstrate that, on average, protected areas increase the species richness of herbivorous fishes, which, in turn, enhances browsing rates on macroalgae. However, in all three regions studied (the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean), a small subset of the herbivore assemblage accounted for the majority of browsing. Our results therefore indicate that ecosystem functioning on coral reefs may respond positively to both area closures and the protection of key species.",18,2019,10.1111/conl.12638,WOS:000482077700001,metaanalysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,species richness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,work based on a meta-analysis approach

In addition, many species constitute important resources for fisheries and tourism activities, with some included in lists of endangered species. In this socio-ecological context, data from fish assemblages has frequently subsidized the creation and/or management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). With the purpose of providing a baseline assessment of reef fish to subsidize the management of Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park (whose acronym in Portuguese is PEMPRM), we describe the composition and assemblages structure of the fishes in this MPA. To inventory the species, we conducted 112 SCUBA dives with the intensive search method at eight sites inside the PEMPRM during six years of sampling. In parallel, to assess the structure of the assemblages, we conducted 63 stationary visual censuses distributed among three of these sites during one year of sampling. In total, 131 taxa belonging to 54 families were identified representing approximately half of the regional diversity. Thirteen of these species (10%) are included in categories with some level of threat IUCN or Brazilian red list categories and six are considered endemic to the Brazilian Biogeographic Province. The assemblages of the three studied sites varied in species richness, number of endangered species, and trophic structure. These results were corroborated by multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA) that indicated significant differences among the assemblages of the three sites. Our results point to a spatial zoning approach for the management of PEMPRM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, a photo-quadratic survey of the macro-benthic invertebrates was conducted to provide more information on these communities. The photo-quadratic survey was conducted within two depth zones at 10 sites, seven inside and three outside the MPA. Representative samples were collected to assist in the identification of organisms. Eight hundred and eighty one photo-quadrats were analysed to determine percentage cover, diversity and community structure of the invertebrate assemblages. A mean evenness of 0.88 species was recorded for the entire study area and a total of 250 species were documented. Location (inside or outside MPA) had a significant effect on species richness (F-1,F-637.4 = 32, p < 0.001) and diversity (F-1,F-5.47 = 24.18, p < 0.001), while depth had a significant effect on percentage cover(F-1,F-761 = 5.9,p < 0.05) and community structure.

In Poole Harbour, UK, a multiple use marine protected area, fishermen utilise a unique pump-scoop dredge to harvest the introduced Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Managers need to balance the socio-economic benefits of the fishery with ecological concerns across the region, which has required a revision of by-laws that include both spatial and temporal measures. Within an operational fishery, we used a Before-After-Control-Impact sampling design to assess the impacts of pump-scoop dredging on benthic physical characteristics and community structure in an area where there was no dredging, an area newly opened to dredging and an area subject to high levels of historic dredging. A sampling grid was used in each area to best capture any fishing effort in the newly opened area. Core samples were taken to a depth of 30 cm within intertidal mudflats. A significant loss of fine sediments was observed in the site subject to high intensity dredging and a significant change in community structure also occurred in both dredged sites throughout the study period. In the newly opened site this was characterised by a relative increase in species richness, including increased abundance of annelid worms, notably Hediste diversicolor and Aphelochaeta marioni and a decline in the abundance of the bivalve mollusc Abra tenuis.

A total of 776 individuals were identified, belonging to the classes of Polyplacophora (5 species, 24 individuals), Gastropoda (62 sp., 240 ind.), Bivalvia (51 sp., 488 ind.), and Scaphopoda (3 sp., 24 ind.). Multivariate analyses revealed significant inter-habitat differences in the composition of mollusc assemblages, especially between soft bottom and all the other habitats. In all MPAs, the highest species richness and feeding guilds occurred in the photophilic hard bottom, where, in contrast, a lower number of individuals was found. On the contrary, in the soft bottom the highest number of individuals and the lower species richness and feeding guilds were found. Although the results pointed out some intra-habitat differences among MPAs, the molluscan assemblages showed a valuable degree of taxonomic and trophic similarity, especially in vegetated habitats.

The survey was conducted at six rocky shores located on the mainland and on coastal islands distributed inside a marine protected area (MPA) and outside the MPA (near a densely populated area). We hypothesized that tropical rocky shores inside the MPA and islands have higher species richness, diversity, and evenness of marine macroalgae. Results confirmed that species richness, diversity and evenness were significantly higher inside the MPA than in rocky shores outside the MPA. Only species richness was higher on islands than on the mainland.

Although some types of fishing activities can impact maerl beds, their effects are poorly studied due to the lack of appropriate un-fished control sites. In this study, we took advantage of the 25 yr old no-take Columbretes Islands Marine Protected Area (MPA) (NW Mediterranean) as the best available reference for pristine conditions and assessed (1) the conservation status of maerl beds in this MPA and (2) the impacts of fishing in nearby beds that are open to this activity. We compared macroalgal species richness (including both calcifying and non-calcifying species), maerl cover and the live proportion of maerl in 3 contiguous zones with different protection histories: inside the 25 yr old MPA (IN25), inside the adjacent 6 yr old MPA (IN6) and in the unprotected grounds surrounding the MPA where fishing continues (OUT). We also analysed differences between shallow (30 to 49 m) and deep (50 to 69 m) beds inside the IN25 area. As expected, all variables were higher in shallow than in deep beds within the IN25, likely because of greater irradiance and water motion in the shallow realm. Maerl cover and algal species richness were greater in deep beds within the IN25 than in the adjacent beds of the OUT region that was composed of similar bathymetric and sediment features, and thus protection from fishing activities in the MPA can best explain these differences. Nonetheless, the proportion of live maerl was similar in both areas. Factors such as differences in light exposure or fragmentation by fishing gear (thus generating new recruits) under a sufficiently intense hydrodynamic regime (thus avoiding burial) may mask fishing impacts on the fraction of live maerl. Similar maerl cover in long-and short-term protected contiguous beds suggests that recovery of such algal beds might occur within 6 yr after fishing cessation.",7,2017,10.3354/meps12110,WOS:000403446100005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"focus on maerl beds, no value of interest"

A significant challenge of reef fish monitoring is to determine the influence of temporal factors on fish counts. Fish assemblages are dynamic and changes in activity patterns throughout the day can influence the results of surveys. While many monitoring programs account for the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on fish assemblages the effects of short-term temporal variation are less well known. In the present study, we analysed data from 197 video drops inside and outside New Caledonian MPAs and examined temporal variations in various metrics commonly used to monitor marine reserves. In addition to describing short-term temporal patterns related to time of day, tide height and state, and lunar cycle; we also examined the influence of these temporal factors on the size and direction of any MPA effects detected. Fewer Serranidae were observed at full moon than the rest of the lunar cycle and there were negative correlations between Chaetodontidae and Acanthuridae abundance and tide height. We did not find any consistent effects of time of day. Generally, variation in short term temporal factors did not affect the direction MPA effects detected but did affect the size of the effects for some metrics. For both small fish abundance and species richness, bigger differences between protected and unprotected sites were detected at high tide than low tide. These results highlight how survey results can vary with timing of sampling and have implications for developing optimal monitoring programs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, a potential for management synergy arises if fisheries related benefits can be associated with the protection of shipwreck sites. This study reviews fish abundance and community assemblage on several ancient shipwreck sites in the Aegean Sea. In this region, the presence or absence of fishing has been correlated to shipwreck condition. The results indicate that, on average, wrecks in worse condition (heavily fished) had 55% lower species richness, 57% lower abundance, and 41% lower diversity than wrecks in pristine condition, though only the patterns for abundance and species richness were statistically significant. No statistically significant change in fish community composition between fished and unfished wrecks was observed, though community composition between shallow water and deep water wrecks was statistically different. This research highlights the potential benefit of marine protected areas around areas of high density of shipwrecks that can both protect these sites and increase local fisheries by preserving these artificial reefs.

However, these results have typically been seen in shallow water systems and questions remain whether this management strategy could be successfully applied to deepwater ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine the efficacy of four deepwater MPAs called bottomfish restricted fishing areas (BRFAs), with various time spans of protection, monitored at depths between 90 and 310 m from 2007 to 2011 for six species of deepwater snapper and one grouper harvested in the Main Hawaiian Islands. Our results suggested that the duration of protection influenced reserve effects, particularly for target species. Mean fish length, and in some cases abundance, increased for one or more of the most economically important target species inside nearly all tested BRFAs. In addition, more mature fish were seen inside the BRFA with the longest duration of protection (similar to 14 years); species richness increased outside this area while inside it remained the same. Here, we provide the first evidence that deepwater MPAs can have positive effects on deepwater species and that many protection effects were consistent with results found in shallow water ecosystems.

Few studies have quantified recovery of temperate rocky reef communities following the cessation of scallop dredging or demersal trawling. This is critical information for the future management of these habitats to contribute towards conservation and fisheries targets. The Lyme Bay MPA, in south west UK, has excluded towed demersal fishing gear from 206 km(2) of sensitive reef habitat using a Statutory Instrument since July 2008. To assess benthic recovery in this MPA we used a flying video array to survey macro epi-benthos annually from 2008 to 2011. 4 treatments (the New Closure, previously voluntarily Closed Controls and Near or Far Open to fishing Controls) were sampled to test a recovery hypothesis that was defined as 'the New Closure becoming more similar to the Closed Controls and less similar to the Open Controls'. Following the cessation of towed demersal fishing, within three years positive responses were observed for species richness, total abundance, assemblage composition and seven of 13 indicator taxa. Definitive evidence of recovery was noted for species richness and three of the indicator taxa (Pentapora fascialis, Phallusia mammillata and Pecten maximus).

Few studies have quantified recovery of temperate rocky reef communities following the cessation of scallop dredging or demersal trawling. This is critical information for the future management of these habitats to contribute towards conservation and fisheries targets. The Lyme Bay MPA, in south west UK, has excluded towed demersal fishing gear from 206 km(2) of sensitive reef habitat using a Statutory Instrument since July 2008. To assess benthic recovery in this MPA we used a flying video array to survey macro epi-benthos annually from 2008 to 2011. 4 treatments (the New Closure, previously voluntarily Closed Controls and Near or Far Open to fishing Controls) were sampled to test a recovery hypothesis that was defined as 'the New Closure becoming more similar to the Closed Controls and less similar to the Open Controls'.

Fish abundance was estimated by visual censuses carried out within the integral reserve zones, within the 1--7m depth range and during four sampling periods. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the assemblage structure among MPAs, although patterns of variation changed considerably from time to time and they were not consistent with latitudinal or longitudinal gradient. Fish assemblages of Miramare (northern Adriatic) and those of the other MPAs clearly separated into two groups. Multivariate differences among MPAs mainly relied upon some relatively common species (e.g. Diplodus puntazzo and Muraena helena). Substantial contribution to these differences was also accounted for by T. pavo. Significant differences among MPAs were detected also in species richness and total density of fish, although the effect of MPA on species richness varied significantly from time to time. Both species richness and total density of fish at Miramare were always higher compared to the other MPAs, likely in relation to peculiar habitat characteristics. Density of T. pavo declined significantly from south to north, thus confirming the thermophily of this species.

The families contributing most to the higher density during summer in the 3 years were acanthurids, chaetodontids, labrids, pomacentrids, scarids, siganids, pomacanthids and caesionids. The increased density of these families in summer was mostly due to increases of juveniles.

The Cape Roux marine protected area (MPA), in the Mediterranean Sea, was established in December 2003 for the management of artisanal fisheries and enhancement target fish stocks.Monitoring of littoral fish assemblages (0-30 m depth) in this zone began one year after the MPA was set up. The survey was conducted at 6 stations, located inside and outside the MPA, using three methods: underwater visual census (UVC) on transects, UVC using a new fish assemblage survey technique (FAST), and experimental net fishing performed by a fisherman. The FAST indices were derived from visual censuses, performed along a random pathway, scoring species on a presence/absence basis and size on a 2-class basis. Indices were calculated seasonally, by applying weights according to species and size. This study presents results obtained between October 2005 and June 2007. In the protected area, the experimental fishing yielded significantly higher abundance and species richness, and the FAST method highlighted a decrease in seasonal fluctuations. These two complementary methods (UVC and experimental fishing) revealed the early changes in fish assemblages in response to protection.

Although those areas are connected biologically over distances > 600km, lack of large-scale sampling and attention to taxa other than scleractinian corals has limited the protection of shallow coral reef and coral community habitats in some areas of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) region, particularly non-offshore islands in Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica. The newly created Las Perlas marine protected area (1688 km 2), the second largest archipelago in the TEP, fills a regional conservation gap for the protection of reefs and potentially becomes the second highest coral diversity area in the MCCTEP. This study describes the distribution of live coral cover and species alpha-diversity over 307 ha of shallow coral reefs and coral communities in the Las Perlas Archipelago. Nineteen scleractinian and 38 octocorals were observed, including species previously thought to be uncommon. Although coral communities generally had a greater number of species than coral reefs, species richness did not differ between habitats. However, their coral and octocoral composition and benthic makeup (coral cover, macroalgae, sponge, etc.) differed. The reefs had higher live coral cover (61.2%) and lower algal cover (32.5%) than the coral communities (26.0% and 65.7%, respectively). Octocorals were more common in the communities than on the reefs. There was a negative relationship between live coral cover and species richness, low to moderate cover generally coinciding with coral community sites and higher species richness. Areas are recommended for marine reserve zoning within the new Las Perlas marine protected area to ensure the protection of important habitats and maintenance of diversity in the TEP, both highlighting the importance of the southern islands of the archipelago for coral diversity and the northern islands for their high live coral cover.

Surveys were conducted in 8 MPAs by various sampling methods (visual surveys by SCUBA diving, anaesthetic catch, poisoning, fishing nets or fishing lines): Port-Cros (France), Lavezzi and Scandola (Corse, France), Monaco, Medes Islands (Spain), Tremiti, Torre Guaceto and Porto Cesareo (Italy). These areas presented similar biotopes (rocky substrata, Posidonia oceanica beds and sandy bottoms) but different ages (1963, Port-Cros to 1997, Porto Cesareo) and sizes (418 ha at Medes Islands to 16600 at Porto Cesareo). Tremiti and Porto Cesareo have a weak protection compared to the other MPAs considered. The first step of this work was to update surveys already published by including new observations and unpublished data. Surveys were then compared using two diversity indexes, Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTD) and Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness (VarTD). For each MPA, these indexes have been compared to theoretical values for the Mediterranean Sea. This theoretical value (331 species belonging to 94 families) was calculated from the total number of species reported in the Mediterranean (FishBase) without the lessepsian species, species inhabiting deep waters (more than 100 m depth), and sub-species. A total of 215 (Port-Cros), 198 (Scandola), 191 Lavezzi, 136 (Medes), 108 (Monaco), 105 (Torre Guaceto), 75 (Tremiti and Porto Cesareo) species have been reported in the different MPAs. Number of species found in Port-Cros, Scandola and Lavezzi corresponded to the diversity expected for Mediterranean fish samples: i.e. the diversity expected from a sample of n species (215, 198 or 191 species respectively) drawn at random from the total list (331 species). VarTD of all the well protected zones corresponded also to the Mediterranean expected values. Therefore, well protected areas allowed preservation of taxonomic relationships between species. Spearman non parametric correlations showed that species richness and AvTD were correlated to the age of MPA and not with its size. In conclusion, the implementation of new MPAs is discussed regarding these relationships: the size of the protected area is not as important as an efficient surveillance and a long term protection to ensure a high fish species diversity.",16,2007,,WOS:000247222300003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the article was written in french

These MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning marine protected area (MPA) design and function using multiple discreet sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the efficacy of existing MLCDs and adjacent habitats using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Most fish assemblage characteristics (e.g. species richness, biomass, number of individuals) were highest in colonized hard bottom habitats (> 10% live coral cover), followed by uncolonized hard bottom habitats (< 10% live coral cover), macroalgae, and sand, respectively. Although biomass was low in sand habitats, apex predators accounted for 62% of the biomass on sand within MLCDs, highlighting the importance of this habitat in reserve design. Within habitats, values for assemblage characteristics were typically higher for MLCDs compared with adjacent areas, emphasizing the importance of protection from fishing irrespective of habitat. Rugosity explained much of the variability in species richness and biomass across all locations. Overall, MLCDs protected from fishing, with high habitat complexity and good habitat quality (e.g. high coral cover and low macroalgae cover), had higher values for most fish assemblage characteristics. Integrating mapping and assessment of reef fish habitat utilization patterns allowed for a robust approach to MPA evaluation and can help inform decisions about MPA design and effectiveness, as well as helping to define essential fish habitat and ecosystem function.",69,2007,10.3354/meps07112,WOS:000252064100019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MLCDs are not MPAs

Representation of biodiversity is necessary in reserve planning, but will ultimately fail for conservation unless factors affecting species' persistence are also incorporated. This study presents an empirical example of the divergent relationships among multiple metrics used to quantify a site's conservation value, including those that address representation (habitat type, species richness, species diversity), and others that address ecological processes and viability (density and reproductive capacity of a keystone species, in this case, the black chiton, Katharina tunicata). We characterized 10 rocky intertidal sites across two habitats in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, according to these site metrics. High-richness and high-production sites for K. tunicata were present in both habitat types, but high richness and high-production sites did not overlap. Across sites, species richness ranged from 29 to 46, and adult K. tunicata varied from 6 to 22 individuals m(-2). Adult density was negatively correlated with species richness, a pattern that likely occurs due to post-recruitment growth and survival because no correlation was evident with non -reproductive juveniles. Sites with high adult density also contributed disproportionately greater potential reproductive output (PRO), defined by total gonad mass. PRO varied by a factor of five across sites and was also negatively correlated with species richness. Compromise or relative weighting would be necessary to select valuable sites for conservation because of inherent contradictions among some reserve selection criteria. We suspect that this inconsistency among site metrics will occur more generally in other ecosystems and emphasize the importance of population viability of strongly interacting species.

Censuses were carried out at 13 stations belonging to 3 sectors: outside the reserve (no protection), non integral reserve (professional fishermen allowed with special permit) and integral reserve (no take area). The species richness by transect and mean density exhibited yearly fluctuations, but over the decade, were less variable in protected sectors that in the non protected sector. The level of variation of total fish assemblage density is lower than those of the main families (Labridae, Sparidae and Serranidae). The long-lived species (e.g., Serranus scriba) displayed lower density variations, i.e., higher inertia, that short-lived species (e.g., Symphodus ocellatus). The resilience of the assemblage (buffer effect) was not affected by spatial heterogeneity, but is related to the level of protection. The higher densities of predator in protected seagrass beds (e.g., Serranidae) and in bordering rocky areas could involve a higher predation pressure upon Posidonia oceanica fish assemblage. The buffer effect may be linked to this increase in predation pressure and fishing prohibition. While long-term data are scarce, available information suggests that, due to protection inside marine protected area, fish assemblages of seagrass beds might be relatively resilient to environmental perturbations. This study highlights the necessity of long-term surveys to support pertinent conclusions on the dynamics of coastal fish assemblages.",33,2000,,WOS:000166958100010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no error associated with the values

In response to the increasing need for conservation efforts in the marine environment, this study compiles and analyses available data on species distributions and compares different approaches to the selection of marine protected area sites for the conservation of South Africa's coastal fish diversity. Species richness decreases from Mozambique southwards to the Cape, due mainly to a subtropical subtraction effect, and is uniformly low along the west coast. The number of species endemic to southern Africa is also higher in the east than the west, and peaks in the region of Port Elizabeth. Hotspot analysis does not provide a useful site-selection tool in a linear (coastal) analysis, at least in the absence of abundance data. Cluster analysis shows that coastal fishes conform to the same three biogeographical provinces as other marine taxa, although the zonal boundaries vary between groups and are particularly difficult to determine for fishes. Multidimensional scaling better illustrates the fairly even rate of species turnover east of Cape Point. The selection of sites at the centre and boundaries of vaguely-defined biogeographical zones is thus relatively difficult, and excludes several localised endemics. These problems can be resolved by using complementarity analysis. In the absence of abundance data, to avoid reserving species at the periphery of their ranges, a pragmatic approach is developed, in which data are refined to include species' core distributions only. The roles of existing marine protected areas are also considered in assessing future conservation needs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Marine protected areas play a key role in the existing management strategy and yet there is little quantitative understanding of the benefits they may provide. We compare the biomass and species richness of fish assemblages on coral and granitic reef habitats in four areas which receive different levels of protection from fishing and other human activities. Species richness of the total fish community, biomass of the total fish community and species richness and biomass of many families were higher on both coralline and granitic reefs in two marine protected areas where protective regulations were effectively enforced However, the biomass of the three principal families of fishes targeted by the fishery was significantly lower in one of these areas. This was attributed to illegal fishing and the fishing concessions offered to local people. We conclude that poaching and minor fishing concessions did not affect the aspects of the fish community which ave important to most tourist visitors (biomass and overall species richness), but that they have a statistically significant effect on the structure of the fish community. Furthermore, whilst a small well-patrolled area will provide an effective refuge from fishing, it will often be stocked by larval fishes which are the progeny of adults living many kilometres away. As such, the protected area cannot operate in isolation to maintain biomass and diversity.

We conducted surveys 2 yr after two storms (in 2011 and 2012) caused severe damage to shallow coral communities within the no-take marine reserve (NTMR) of Apo Island, which led to declines in fish populations that had built up over three decades. We found that hard coral cover was restricted to < 40 m deep in the storm-impacted NTMR and a nearby fished area not impacted by storms. Benthic cover at mesophotic depths (> 30 m) was dominated by sand/rubble and rock (dead coral) with low cover of soft corals, sponges and macroalgae. Storm damage appeared to have reached the deepest limit of the fringing reef (40 m) and reduced variability in benthic structure within the NTMR.

Shallow-water surveys investigated Posidonia oceanica meadows at five sites in the Asinara Island MPA and three karstic submerged caves in the Capo Caccia-Isola Piana MPA. The annotated checklist shows notably high values of taxonomic richness, confirming that P. oceanica meadows and karstic caves are key habitats for Porifera assemblages. Indeed, the sponge taxa recorded (n = 77) with 59 cavedwelling and 45 taxa in seagrass meadows represent over 10% of the total Mediterranean sponge fauna, despite the small areas investigated, restricted biotopes and low sampling effort.

Assemblage structures by size and by trophic group were significantly related to the distance to market. 3. Relationships of reef fish life-history traits, families, and vulnerability indicators were examined with the seascape and the benthic composition at Los Roques Archipelago, the most isolated MPA in the analysis. Factors linked to seascape features were more important than benthic composition or human activities in explaining fish assemblage structure. 4. Wave exposure was the most influential seascape metric. Exposed habitats were dominated by octocorals and sponges. More sheltered habitats were characterized by high coral cover, while leeward sites were characterized by steep slopes with close proximity to deeper water. 5. Exposed habitats were mostly occupied by unspecialized fish species. Piscivore densities were high at south and south-west sites, and were likely related to the large concentrations of planktivorous fishes found there. South and south-west sites experience full oceanic conditions, and supported the highest species richness and densities within the archipelago. 6.

Generally, well-managed and enforced MPAs can increase or maintain the diversity and function of the enclosed coral reef, with some of the benefits extending to adjacent nonprotected reefs. A fundamental question in coral reef conservation is whether these benefits arise within small MPAs (< 1 km(2)), because larval input of reef organisms is largely decoupled from local adult reproduction. We examined the structure of fish assemblages, composition of fish feeding groups, benthic cover, and key ecosystem processes (grazing, macroalgal browsing, and coral replenishment) in three small (0.5-0.8 km(2)) no-take MPAs and adjacent areas where fisheries are allowed (non-MPAs) on coral reefs in Fiji. The MPAs exhibited greater species richness, density, and biomass of fishes than non-MPAs. Furthermore, MPAs contained a greater abundance and biomass of grazing herbivores and piscivores as well as a greater abundance of cleaners than fished areas. We also found differences in fish associations when foraging, with feeding groups being generally more diverse and having greater biomass within MPAs than adjacent non-MPAs. Grazing by parrotfishes was 3-6 times greater, and macroalgal browsing was 3-5 times greater in MPAs than in non-MPAs.

The holdfasts associated fauna is sensitive to the kelp fishery in northern Chile because one of the management recommendation is to harvest the whole plant. Considering the above, and the ecological role play by brown algae as foundation species, this study proposes the use of fauna inhabiting the holdfasts as an ecological indicator to monitor the integrity of exploited kelp beds. To accomplish this objective, the morphology of plants and holdfasts was evaluated together with the composition, abundance and community structure associated in three types of resource conservation strategies based on fishery management spatially explicit: open access areas and management areas (to harvest), and marine protected areas (with no harvest), in Atacama and Coquimbo (26-32 degrees S). The results show that high harvest pressure on exploited kelp beds transforms the plant morphology and holdfast, altering the colonization process and species aggregation predicted for these biogenic habitats modifying the expected biodiversity. Thus, associated fauna in open access areas has lower species richness, abundance and biodiversity of organisms than their counterparts in management areas or marine protected areas. Moreover, the structure of the holdfast associated communities, are more variables in open access areas. The results suggest that holdfasts are representative micro-ecosystems of the intertidal environment, and can be used as sampling replicable and comparable units to monitor exploited kelp beds integrity in fisheries open access areas.

The two areas are morphologically similar, and comparison of the physicochemical parameters (salinity, transparency, temperature and percentage of saturation of dissolved oxygen) showed that the water masses are similar. The bio-ecological indicators and ecological, trophic and size structures were also compared. Given the environmental similarity of the two sites, their differences in bio-ecological characteristics and fish assemblage organization can be explained by the protection status of the MPA. The species richness and fish abundance per sampling unit were higher in the exploited site, but the mean trophic level and the observed maximum size of individuals were higher in the MPA. Although slightly higher for the MPA, the differences observed for biomass and average size between the two sites were not significant. The beta diversity in the MPA was higher than in the exploited site. The fish assemblage was dominated in terms of abundance by two pelagic herbivores Ethmalosa fimbriata (80%) and Sardinella maderensis (123%) and in terms of biomass by E. fimbriata (37.4%) and a benthic predator, Arius lariscutatus (23.7%). The assemblage of the MPA had a marine affinity characterized by the presence of piscivorous or generalist predators; large individuals were not uncommon. In the exploited site, the fish assemblage was relatively stable, dominated in abundance by E. fimbriata (33.4%) and S. maderensis (32.8%). In terms of biomass, a species of mullet, Liza dumerili, ranked first (26.2%), followed by E. fimbriata (22.4%) and S. maderensis (14.9%). The assemblage in the exploited site had a more estuarine affinity, dominated by detritivorous or phytophagous herbivores. Individuals observed there were mostly of small or medium size. This study confirms that the establishment of MPA is an effective tool for restoring marine biodiversity and trophic structure of fish assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared CPUE and species richness among 3 management areas (continuously closed, periodically closed, and open to commercial bottom trawling) using analysis of covariance models that account for variability due to area, year, and depth. The most appropriate models for CPUE (35 species treated individually and aggregated into 6 subgroups) and species richness were selected using Akaike's information criterion. All of the best-fit models were highly significant (p < 0.0001), explaining 3 to 76% of the variation in catch. For 27 species and 5 subgroups, mean CPUE was significantly greater within the area continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling relative to areas periodically closed or open. The most appropriate model for richness included area and year, and mean richness was greatest in the area continuously closed to trawling. Species-specific length composition distributions were calculated from subsampled individual lengths for 31 species. Significant differences in length frequency distributions were observed, with a higher proportion (similar to 65%) of larger fish most often present in areas continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling (20 of 31 species) relative to other areas.

Numbers of non-exploited species in these sites, and species represented at abundance levels equal to or greater than the targets set for juveniles of economically important species were identified, and both were compared with mean totals from 100 sets of randomly drawn squares of equivalent number to simulation results.Percentages of non-exploited species among all scenarios varied from 81-97%. All species absent from simulation results were rare regionally. Species richness was lower in each case compared with randomly drawn squares, but only marginally. However, more species were represented in complementary sites at abundance levels equal to or greater than the targets set for economically important species.These results were interpreted with respect to a definition of biodiversity that includes species as well as functional and structural ecosystem components, and it was concluded that the dual objectives of fishery management and biodiversity conservation can be achieved, at least in some cases, within a single network of marine protected areas of moderate size.

To mitigate and potentially reverse some of these impacts, the European Union (EU) has mandated the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in order to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) in EU waters by 2020. The primary initiative for achieving GES is the implementation of coherent networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Marine reserves are an important type of MPA in which no extraction is allowed, but their usefulness depends upon a number of ecological, management, and political factors. This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological effects of existing European marine reserves and the factors (social and ecological) underlying their effectiveness. Results show that existing European marine reserves foster significant positive increases in key biological variables (density, biomass, body size, and species richness) compared with areas receiving less protection, a pattern mirrored by marine reserves around the globe. For marine reserves to achieve their ecological and social goals, however, they must be designed, managed, and enforced properly. In addition, identifying whether protected areas are ecologically connected as a network, as well as where new MPAs should be established according to the MSFD, requires information on the connectivity of populations across large areas. The adoption of the MSFD demonstrates willingness to achieve the long-term protection of Europe's marine ecosystems, but whether the political will (local, regional, and continent wide) is strong enough to see its mandates through remains to be seen. Although the MSFD does not explicitly require marine reserves, an important step towards the protection of Europe's marine ecosystems is the establishment of marine reserves within wider-use MPAs as connected networks across large spatial scales.

The purpose was to provide baseline data on inshore line-fish stocks in the MPA. A total of 28 species was recorded, of which 53% have a conservation status reflecting some concern and 43% are endemic to southern Africa. This highlights the value of the MPA for protection of important line-fish species. Within the MPA, localised differences were detected in species diversity, size frequency and catch per unit effort between unexploited and illegally exploited areas. These differences were more prominent in slow growing, long-lived species. It thus appears that illegal exploitation is negatively affecting fish populations within the MPA, which counteract and potentially could eliminate the benefits of fish protection typically associated with no-take MPAs. These results highlight the need for improved law enforcement and better communication with neighbouring communities to increase awareness. It is further recommended that the current no-take status of the MPA should be maintained. In addition, baseline fisheries information was collected on certain fish species that could be used to inform future conservation management of the MPA.",11,2012,10.4102/koedoe.v54i1.1059,WOS:000326033200005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

This exceptional biodiversity is under severe threats [1] but benefits from a system of 100 marine protected areas (MPAs). Surprisingly, the spatial congruence of fish biodiversity hot spots with this MPA system and the areas of high fishing pressure has not been assessed. Moreover, evolutionary and functional breadth of species assemblages [3] has been largely overlooked in marine systems. Here we adopted a multifaceted approach to biodiversity by considering the species richness of total, endemic, and threatened coastal fish assemblages as well as their functional and phylogenetic diversity. We show that these fish biodiversity components are spatially mismatched. The MPA system covers a small surface of the Mediterranean (0.4%) and is spatially congruent with the hot spots of all taxonomic components of fish diversity. However, it misses hot spots of functional and phylogenetic diversity. In addition, hot spots of endemic species richness and phylogenetic diversity are spatially congruent with hot spots of fishery impact.

The success of MPAs stems from the overall positive benefits attributed to the reserve effect, the totality of the consequences of protecting marine systems. The reserve effect includes but is beyond the goal of protecting particular species or areas with economical or cultural value. However, most data on the effects of MPAs focus on target species and there is limited evidence for the consequences of protection at larger levels of organization. Quantitative information on the reserve effect remains elusive partly because of its complex nature. Data on biodiversity can be used to quantify the reserve effect if not restricted to specific taxonomic groups. In our study, we quantified species diversity, trophic diversity, and an approach to functional diversity in five MPAs and adjacent non-protected areas along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Our three measures of diversity were based on the abundance of algae, fish, sessile and mobile invertebrates in shallow water rocky communities and could be used to estimate the reserve effect based on species, trophic levels, or functional roles. We tested the hypothesis that species, trophic, and functional diversity were higher in protected areas than in adjacent non-protected areas. Species diversity varied with geographic area but not with protection status. However, we found higher functional diversity inside MPAs. Also, the effect of protection on functional diversity varied as a function of the geographic area. Our results support the uniqueness of MPAs at a species level and the universality of the reserve effect at the level of the trophic groups' composition. This type of comprehensive ecological approach may broaden our understanding of MPAs and their efficiency as management tools. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have applied these models in large estuaries which have unique characteristics that need to be considered in MPA design, including strong physical, chemical and biological gradients and significant human impacts. We explored how one design model, MARXAN, can be applied to estuarine systems by developing MPA design scenarios for Long Island Sound, an estuary in the northeastern USA. Using sedimentary texture as a proxy for habitats, we modeled and tested several scenarios where conservation goals differed with respect to location and spatial scale but included 10 to 20% representation of target habitats and spatially contiguous MPAs. When the entire estuary was modeled, potentially critical locations were not included in the solutions. Dividing the estuary into regions to account for spatial gradients proved a better approach. Final MPA solutions were tested for effectiveness by comparing benthic species richness and community composition inside and outside solutions. Solutions in the eastern region of Long Island Sound generally contained higher species richness, likely due to the inclusion of highly heterogeneous portions of the sea floor within most solutions, but community composition varied. In contrast, solutions in the western/central region of the estuary usually had lower species richness but similar community composition. We also made preliminary assessments of how human activities, including dredge disposal, resource extraction and sediment pollution, might affect MPA design in estuaries. Our results illustrate potential conflicts that may arise due to the geographic location of best MPA candidate areas in estuarine regions with environmental impacts and human activities. Several tradeoffs will likely affect MPA design and selection in large estuarine systems, and MPA design models may prove useful in focusing these efforts.",7,2008,10.3354/meps07727,WOS:000262731000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,species richness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,"model and prediction, no usefull data"

The two marine reserves, and their corresponding non-reserves, were located in different geographical locations within Moreton Bay (north and south) and sites were surveyed with multiple hauls of a seine net. Species richness, evenness, density and mean size of the inshore communities were compared between the reserves and non-reserves. No statistical significant difference was detected in species richness between the areas however species evenness was significantly lower in the only non-reserve site impacted by commercial net fishing. Mean size of nekton was found to be significantly greater in the marine reserves compared to non-reserves but no statistical significant difference was found in the density of nekton between the study sites. Multivariate analysis revealed differences in community composition, particularly between the geographical locations where areas were impacted by different types of fishing pressure (recreational v commercial). These results highlight the impact commercial fishing can have on entire nekton assemblages, not just on targeted species.

Hypotheses were tested to investigate the importance of habitat linkages in the US Virgin Islands. As expected, reef context (the spatial pattern of surrounding habitat patches) was a strong predictor of reef fish assemblage structure. Specific relationships were functionally consistent with the ecology of the fishes of interest. For example, reefs with large amounts of seagrass nearby harbored the greatest numerical abundance of fishes, particularly mobile invertebrate feeders and the exploited fish families of Haemulidae (grunts) and Lutjanidae (snappers). Species richness for the entire fish community and within these fish groups was also strongly associated with reef context. Furthermore, reef fish mobility influenced how fishes related to reef context. Fish-habitat relationships were detected as far as 1 km from study reefs, suggesting that fish movements result in habitat encounter rates that may influence their patterns of distribution.

To mitigate these impacts, a trawling ban has been enforced in Hong Kong waters since December 31, 2012 to rehabilitate the ecosystem and enhance fisheries resources. Previous studies demonstrated that reduced trawling activities would increase the heterogeneity of benthic habitats, thereby enhancing species richness and abundance of benthic fauna and providing more prey resources for predatory fishes. This study aimed to test a hypothesis that the population and trophic dynamics of the Bartail flathead Platycephalus indicus, a heavily fished benthic predatory fish, at inner and outer Tolo Channel of Hong Kong (i.e., EI and EO) improved with increases in their body size, abundance, biomass, trophic niche, and trophic position after the trawl ban. Samples were collected from trawl surveys before and after the trawl ban to compare the pre-ban and post-ban populations of P. indicus from EI and EO. Body size, abundance, and biomass were assessed in 2004, 2013-2014, and 2015-2016, whereas trophic niche and trophic position were analyzed based on stable isotopes of fish samples collected in dry season of 2012, 2015, and 2018. Following the trawl ban, the abundance and biomass of P. indicus increased in EO, with body size increased in EI. Furthermore, as indicated by the results of stable isotope analysis (SIA) on their tissues and prey items, trophic niche, and trophic position of P. indicus increased in EI and EO, respectively.

These fish use coastal marine ecosystems as nursery areas, but also to forage and to avoid predation or competition. We studied spatial, seasonal, lunar and diel variations in a coastal fish community from a marine protected area of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. Fish were sampled with 46 beach seine net sessions in 2015 and 2016. A total of 35 fish species of 25 families were captured. Fish abundance varied between years and seasons, with a higher abundance in the dry season, but not by lunar tide. Nonetheless, the community composition was broadly similar over the seasons, among islands and between lunar tides. Clupeidae, Haemulidae and Gerreidae were the most abundant fish families. Sardinella maderensis highly dominated the captures throughout the year, with catches much higher than any other species. The differences in abundance between seasons and years may be related with movements to or from the shore due to feeding activity or to avoid predation, or else to differences in recruitment between years. There were no significant diel differences in species richness and diversity, although higher numbers of fish were captured during daytime. For most species the majority of individuals captured were immature, highlighting the importance of the archipelago as nursery area for several species. These small pelagics, and particularly Sardinella maderensis, represent the main prey for several marine predators.

Monitoring methods based on seabed imagery data are prone to inconsistencies in both the identification and enumeration of species, which is a major hurdle in detecting meaningful ecological change. To overcome this problem, our study used a single monitoring dataset, collected using one standard method at the Pisces Reef Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2016. We identified which method of data extraction from seabed imagery is best able to detect change along a gradient of anthropogenic resuspended sediments, which represents a pressure on the epifaunal community. We modelled the spatial distribution of the pressure, caused by nearby fishing activity, using an approach based on individual Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) ping data, rather than spatially homogenised data aggregated to a grid cell. We found that up to 22% of the biological variability across the three reef areas within the MPA is explained by the measured and derived environmental variables. The response of the epibenthic community at Pisces Reef MPA to the resuspended sediments pressure gradient is masked by commonly used univariate metrics such as species diversity and abundance of individuals. Conversely, a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) identifies community-level change caused by a low level of modelled resuspended sediments pressure. We found that a 0.05 decimal degree grid cell of seabed within 1 km of the MPA boundary, swept by demersal fishing gear as little as five times per year on average, can elicit such a community response. The data extraction metric best able to detect this change in the sublittoral rock community is the frequency of occurrence of taxa in images with an average field of view of 0.7 m2, using a 25-cell grid. More traditional metrics extracted from seabed imagery, such as raw counts and percentage cover estimates, are less sensitive to detecting such community change. The TITAN also identified taxon-level responses to the pressure gradient that could be considered for future monitoring programmes. The solitary coral genus Caryophyllia and cup-like sponges show a sharp and strong negative response to pressure exposure, and could represent a starting point for a future monitoring programme of UK sublittoral rock habitats. The implications for future monitoring are discussed, including survey design, environmental and biological data collection and improved pressure modelling.",0,2021,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107545,WOS:000637200100003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Their main characteristic is the massive development of crustose macroalgae, the corallines, which form a bio-constructed basal layer. However, when growing on granitic substrates, these algae show a lower capacity to build thick concretions than those present on limestone. Assemblages developing on isolated granitic outcrops were investigated by scuba diving at 73 sites down to a depth of 56 m within the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (NE Sardinia, Mediterranean Sea). These outcrops were characterised by a scarce development of crustose corallines, due to the widespread presence of the brown algae Carpomitra costata and, to a lesser extent, Cystoseira zosteroides. Animal dominance increased with depth, mainly by sponges, in particular Axinella spp. and several species of Keratosa (Dysidea spp., Sarcotragus foetidus, Spongia lamella and S. officinalis). Gorgonians, which typically characterise the upper layer of coralligenous assemblages, were scarcely represented: Eunicella cavolini and E. verrucosa were generally rare, E. singularis was widespread, while Paramuricea clavata was comparatively frequent only at depth. All these features determined a peculiar community that was markedly different from the coralligenous assemblages occurring on neighbouring limestone rocks. Such a community, clearly characterised by the dearth of the typical biogenic hard substrate made by coralline algae, uneven distribution of gorgonians and, especially, the dominance of large and erect sponges, constitutes a distinctive facies of Mediterranean circalittoral communities worthy of conservation.

Fish abundance, size, and habitat composition were compared inside PPAs and NTMRs on inshore reefs of the central GBR. Fish abundances were lower inside PPAs relative to adjacent NTMRs for primary fishing targets, with no detectable effects for secondary targets and non-targets, or for species richness.

Partially Protected Areas supported 46%-69% of the relative abundance of total primary targets compared to adjacent NTMRs, with no evident increase in abundance in zones where spearfishing was prohibited. There were no reductions in the size of two key target species: coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) and stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus) inside PPAs, and only stripey snapper had significant reductions in abundance inside PPAs compared to NTMRS.

We detect less fish species in marine reserves than in nearby fished areas. The paradoxical gradient in species richness is accompanied by a marked change in fish species composition under different managements. This dissimilarity is mainly driven by species that are often overlooked by classical visual surveys but detected with eDNA: cryptobenthic, pelagic, and rare fishes.

During the last decade, Cystoseira forests have retracted their range considerably due to many interacting environmental, biological and anthropogenic pressures. We investigated how reducing in patch-size of C. montagnei affects their associated molluscan communities at the shallow northwest rocky shores of Palermo (Sicily, Italy). Molluscs were sampled from the fronds of individual thalli, clumps of 3 and 5 thalli of C. montagnei over an annual vegetative cycle (May-September) in two sites within the Marine Protected Area Capo Gallo-Isola delle Femmine. We measured five substrate attributes of the alga (thallus volume, canopy volume, interstitial volume, algal surface, and biomass) and explored their relationships with the diversity of the associated molluscan assemblage. A total of 3756 individuals of molluscs were collected, belonging to 30 families and 57 species, being Rissoidae the most speciose family and Barleeidae the dominant in terms of abundance. The molluscan assemblage on C. montagnei displayed significant spatial and seasonal variations, with the maximum number of individuals and species in summer, whereas evenness and diversity displayed maximum values in spring. The abundance, species richness and diversity of the molluscan assemblage decreased with decreasing in patch-size of C. montagnei, regardless of the vegetative phase of the alga or the sites considered in the study, while evenness showed an opposite trend. The substrate attributes of C. montagnei changed over the vegetative cycle of the alga and showed a similar pattern across sites with values that tended to decrease in autumn during the quiescence phase of the alga. Variation in patch-size of C. montagnei affected also the substrate attributes of the individual alga, with individual thalli becoming smaller with increasing patch-size. The algal surface of a single thallus of C. montagnei ranged on average from 956 cm(2) in spring to 289 cm(2) in autumn. Furthermore, algal surface together with thallus volume and dry weight were the substrate attributes that explained better the variation of the number of molluscan individuals and species. Overall, our results suggest that the reduction of both patch-size and algal substrate of C. montagnei forests altered the structure and composition of its associated molluscan assemblage. We argue that a reduction or loss of Cystoseira forests could probably trigger bottom-up effects in rocky shores habitats, with consequences for the whole ecosystem structure, functioning and services provided to humans.",2,2021,10.1016/j.ecss.2020.107163,WOS:000620815600004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Boosted regression trees were used to model the response of each fish group to 21 predictor variables: 13 habitat variables, 5 island variables, and 3 fishing variables (no-take marine reserve [NTMR] presence or absence, NTMR size, and NTMR age). Targeted and nontargeted fish groups responded most strongly to habitat variables, then island variables. Fishing (NTMR) variables generally had less influence on fish groups. Of the habitat variables, live hard coral cover, structural complexity or habitat complexity index, and depth had the greatest effects on density, biomass, and species richness of targeted fish groups and on the density of nontargeted fishes. Of the island variables, proximity to the nearest river and island elevation had the most influence on fish groups. The NTMRs affected only fishes targeted by fishers; NTMR size positively correlated with density, biomass, and species richness of targeted fishes, particularly mesopredatory, and grazing and detritivorous fishes. Importantly, NTMRs as small as 15 ha positively affected medium-bodied fishes. This finding provides reassurance for regions that have invested in small-scale community-managed NTMRs. However, management strategies that integrate sound coastal land-use practices to conserve adjacent reef fish habitat, strategic NTMR placement, and establishment of larger NTMRs will be crucial for maintaining biodiversity and fisheries.",2,2021,10.1111/cobi.13636,WOS:000607151500001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

Therefore, unraveling their patterns can contribute to a better assessment of local biodiversity dynamics.Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is a cost-effective, non-intrusive method providing long-term information regardless of weather or logistic conditions, which can be especially useful when monitoring remote areas. Using PAM, we assess temporal dynamics of fish vocal activity in a protected seamount and validate PAM as an important tool for biodiversity assessment in deep-sea fish communities. Thus, we evaluated the annual, seasonal and diel patterns of variation of putative fish sounds identified in an Azorean protected seamount, the Condor (ca.190 m depth). Here, 3 years (2008, 2010 and 2012) of acoustic data were collected and analysed for diversity and abundance of the most prevalent fish sounds. We compared abundance and diversity of fish sounds before and after the establishment of the marine protected area in 2010, to assess its initial protection effects. We also compared abundance and biodiversity measures (richness and Shannon diversity index) of acoustic data with fishing data from deep-water longline surveys, to verify if acoustic diversity and taxonomic diversity show a similar trend. Additionally, we estimated a likely distance range of fish sound sources from the acoustic data loggers for local background noise and typical fish sound levels. Estimated detection distance of different fish sounds, considering Condor background noise level and reported fish sound source levels, were typically larger than 10 m and could reach hundreds of meters in some species suggesting that this study potentially targeted sounds of the deep-sea fish fauna. Fish acoustic activity was prevalent at dusks and nights of all years, while no overall seasonal pattern was detected. However, one sound sequence (#1) was dominant in the autumns of all studied period. A decrease in abundance and richness of sounds was observed from 2008 to 2012 in line with the results of fishing surveys.

We also assessed the potential of zooplankton as prey for upper trophic levels, in particular the larvae of the Fuegian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), a key species in the food web of the NMPA/BB.

The high abundance of nauplii and copepods suggests that spring is an appropriate time for their reproduction and, given their size structure, they represent an adequate food source for Fuegian sprat larvae.

The present study evaluated the effect of a mangrove NTR on the conservation of juvenile fish abundance, commercial fish biomass and biodiversity at the assemblage level, and the abundance of juveniles, target and non-target adults at the family level. The evaluation incorporated one aspect of seascape connectivity, namely proximity to the sea, or in this case, the Gulf of Paria. Linear mixed models showed that the NTR had a positive effect only on species richness at the assemblage level. However, juvenile fish abundance, commercial fish biomass, taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity were not enhanced in the NTR. The inclusion of connectivity in these models still failed to identify any positive effects of the NTR at the assemblage level. Yet, there were significant benefits to juvenile fish abundance for 5 of 7 families, and for 1 family of non-target adults. Possible explanations for the limited success of the NTR for fish assemblages include failing to account for the ecology of fish species in NTR design, the drawbacks of 'inside-outside' (of the NTR) experimental designs and the fact that fishing does not always impact non-target species. It is important to recognise that mangrove NTRs do not necessarily benefit fish assemblages as a whole, but that finer-scale assessments of specific families may reveal some of the proclaimed benefits of NTRs in tropical estuaries.",0,2020,10.3354/meps13436,WOS:000621226100010,field,CI,2015,MPA,Caroni Swamp,28,,1987,FPA,,20.9,20.9,,no,Trinite-et-Tobago,tropical,South America,Carabean Sea,mangrove,,ecological,fish,,,,,NA,,biodiversity,,species richness,,positive,yes,number,Variance,,,,,,,,,11.60,48.00,8.71,2.951413247,8.20754717,33,5.391709683,2.32200553,0.346276237,0.003773198,,,mangrove closer to river than ocean

SPSPA has low species richness and high endemism; nonetheless, the diversity of fishes from deep habitats (>30 m depth) had not been previously studied in detail. Several expeditions conducted between 2009 and 2018 explored the shallow and deep reefs of SPSPA using scuba, closed-circuit rebreathers, manned submersibles, baited remote underwater stereo-videos (stereo-BRUV) and fishing between 0 and 1050 m depth. These expeditions yielded 41 new records of fishes for SPSPA: 9 in open waters, 9 in shallow waters (0-30 m), 8 in mesophotic ecosystems (30-150 m) and 15 in deeper reefs (>150 m). Combined with literature records of adult pelagic, shallow and deep-reef species, as well as larvae, the database of the fish biodiversity for SPSPA currently comprises 225 species (169 recorded as adult fishes and 79 as larvae, with 23 species found in both stages). Most of them (112) are pelagic, 86 are reef-associated species and 27 are deep-water specialists. Species accumulation curves show that the number of fish species has not yet reached an asymptote. Whereas the number of species recorded in SPSPA is similar to that in other oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the proportion of shorefishes is relatively lower, and the endemism level is the third highest in the Atlantic. Twenty-nine species are listed as threatened with extinction. Observations confirm the paucity of top predators on shallow rocky reefs of the island, despite the presence of several pelagic shark species around SPSPA. Because all of the endemic species are reef associated, it is argued that the new marine-protected areas created by the Brazilian government do not ensure the protection and recovery of SPSPA's biodiversity because they allow exploitation of the most vulnerable species around the archipelago itself. This study suggests a ban on reef fish exploitation inside an area delimited by the 1000 m isobath around the islands (where all known endemics are concentrated) as the main conservation strategy to be included in the SPSPA management plan being prepared by the Brazilian government.",3,2020,10.1111/jfb.14484,WOS:000566343800001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

We conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of impacts on fisheries production and ecological responses to pelagic MPAs of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. A Bayesian time series-based counterfactual modelling approach using fishery-dependent data was used to compare the temporal response in the MPAs to three reference regions for standardized catch rates, lengths, trophic level of the catch and species diversity. Catch rates of bigeye tuna, the main target species (Kingman/Palmyra MPA, causal effect probability >99% of an 84% reduction; 95% credible interval: -143%, -25%), and blue shark (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) were significantly lower and longnose lancetfish significantly higher (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) than predicted had the MPAs not been established, possibly from closing areas near shallow features, which aggregate pelagic predators, and from 'fishing-the-line'. There were no apparent causal impacts of the MPAs on species diversity, lengths and trophic level of the catch, perhaps because the MPAs were young, were too small, did not contain critical habitat for specific life-history stages, had been lightly exploited or experienced fishing-the-line. We also assessed model-standardized catch rates for species of conservation concern and mean trophic level of the catch within and outside of MPAs. Displaced effort produced multi-species conflicts: MPAs protect bycatch hotspots and hotspots of bycatch-to-target catch ratios for some at-risk species, but coldspots for others. Mean trophic level of the catch was significantly higher around MPAs, likely due to the aggregating effect of the shallow features and there having been light fishing pressure within MPAs.

The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a submerged plateau (average depth 100 m) that constitutes the westernmost segment of the North Scotia Ridge (54 degrees-55 degrees S; 56 degrees-62 degrees W). The BB hosts rich benthic biodiversity in low chlorophyll waters of the southern Patagonian Shelf, Argentina, declared Namuncura Marine Protected Area (NMPA) in 2013. So far, the pelagic microorganisms above the bank have not been described. During austral summer 2016, we assessed the microbial plankton (0.2-200 mu m cell size) biomass and their taxonomical and functional diversity along a longitudinal transect (54.2-55.3 degrees S, 58- 68 degrees W) from the Beagle Channel ( BC) to the BB, characterized by contrasting hydrography. Results displayed a marked zonation in the composition and structure of the microbial communities. The biomass of phytoplankton > 5 mu m was 28 times higher in the BC, attributed mainly to large diatom blooms, than in oceanic waters above the BB, where the small coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and flagellates < 10 mu m dominated. In turn, the biomass of microheterotrophs above the BB doubled the biomass in the BC due to large ciliates. Notably, toxic phytoplankton species and their phycotoxins were detected, in particular high abundance of Dinophysis acuminata and pectenotoxins above the bank, highlighting their presence in open subpolar regions. Picophytoplankton (< 2 mu m), including Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, were remarkably important above the BB, both at surface and deep waters (up to 150 m). Their biomass surpassed by 5 times that of phytoplankton > 5 mu m, emphasizing the importance of small-sized phytoplankton in low chlorophyll waters.

Here we assess ecological responses to no-take marine reserves over two decades, spanning a major climate-driven coral bleaching event. Pre-bleaching reserve responses were consistent with a large literature, with higher coral cover, more species of fish, and greater fish biomass, particularly of upper trophic levels. However, in the 16 years following coral mortality, reserve effects were absent for the reef benthos, and greatly diminished for fish species richness. Positive fish biomass effects persisted, but the groups of fish benefiting from marine reserves profoundly changed, with low trophic level herbivores dominating the responses. These findings highlight that while marine reserves still have important roles on coral reefs in the face of climate change, the species and functional groups they benefit will be substantially altered. It is unclear whether rapid climate change will alter the effectiveness of marine reserves. Here Graham et al. use a 20-year time-series from the Seychelles to show that marine reserves may not prevent climate-driven shifts in community composition, and that ecological responses to reserves are substantially altered.",12,2020,10.1038/s41467-020-15863-z,WOS:000558820800018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

Although MUMPAs have produced benefits around the world, the persistence of moderate fishing pressure reduces the likelihood of achieving the primary objective of these areas, which is the conservation of ecosystems. In this study we used traditional and functional metrics to evaluate how fish assemblages changed through time in a MUMPA, including shifts in species responses and in ecological processes. We conducted visual censuses of fishes at Espiritu Santo Island, Mexico (MUMPA; N D 320; 24 degrees N, 110 degrees W) from 2005 to 2017 to assess fish richness, size-distribution and density. Three functional indices were calculated using six traits (size, mobility, period of activity, aggregation, position in water column and diet): functional richness (volume occupied by species), dispersion (complementarity between species) and originality (inverse of functional redundancy). We compared fish diversity among three management zone types (sustainable fishing, traditional fishing and no-take zones), through a 13-year period, assessing which species increased or decreased in occurrence, density, and biomass, and how indices respond over time. Despite a general increase in biomass and stability in density and originality, we detected a reduction in fish biodiversity in the form of declines in species and functional richness, which could imply the risk of local extinction and decrease in certain ecosystem processes. In addition, changes in functional dispersion showed that some functions are losing representation through time. Although no single cause is apparent, such factors as competitive interactions, habitat loss and persistence of fishing pressure potentially explain these decreases. The rise in biomass was associated with a general increase in the average size, rather than increased biomass of commercial species, as the latter remained stable during the study period. Expansion of no-take areas, enforcement of fishing regulations, and surveillance in core zones, should be implemented to reverse the decline in particular species and to promote conservation of fish functional diversity in this MUMPA.",2,2020,10.7717/peerj.8885,WOS:000525081400005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,data of interest are shown in a boxplot

Most of those principal species would be expected in catches taken in oceanic waters beyond the shelf break. Only the bottom-spawning Melanostigma atlanticum was, within the surveyed area, distinctively a species of the canyon. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary variations in the assemblage were aligned with drivers that act in open ocean: depth, water mass and both diel and seasonal cycles. However, the effect of the canyon was evident in an up-canyon decline in the catches of most species.

Furthermore, this study tested the effect of ignoring reef size in spatial comparisons. Our results showed that reef size had a significant positive effect on the relative abundance and average biomass of most, but not all species. When reef size was included in the models, the results showed that two of the six species presented no effect of management zone; two appeared to be directly affected by the permitted (past and present) fishing activity in the CPZ; and the last two species appeared to be affected by the disturbance caused by the diving and/or boating activity in the CPZ. Excluding reef size from the analysis consistently resulted in the predicted relative abundance and average biomass decreasing in the CPZ and increasing in the NTSZ. This effect was most marked in the average biomass data, as the management zone effect changed from negligible to significant for five of the six species.

Species richness showed a quadratic correlation to temperature with an optimum of similar to 14 degrees C. Abundances of individual species were affected by temperature and salinity, and showed both seasonal, spatial and diel variations. The negative effect of high temperatures on species richness was not seen at night, indicating that marine species utilize these areas as nocturnal feeding grounds or to avoid larger predators.

Few studies have examined the effects of vessels on marine mammals in the Arctic, but beluga whales appear to be especially sensitive to vessel traffic. We examine how the vocalizations of belugas are impacted by vessel traffic in the Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Area in the Mackenzie River estuary of the western Canadian Arctic. Between one and four acoustic recorders were deployed between June and August each year between 2015 and 2018 near the only shipping channel at this site.

Beluga vocalizations within the range of the acoustic recorder decreased significantly when vessels were within 5 km of the acoustic recorder.

Future work is needed to assess exactly how belugas are reacting to vessel traffic in this area and what the long-term consequences of these reactions are.

In this contribution, we documented the diversity of scleractinian corals, octocorals, algae, and sponges across nested spatial scales spanning four orders of magnitude (10(1)-10(5) m). In addition, we tested the hypothesis that species diversity followed a gradient along the ca. 200 km of reef tract. Across the archipelago, we examined benthic cover and species diversity within 255 photo-quadrats (25 x 25 cm) at 13 fore reef sites (two sampling locations per site, and 10 photo-quadrats per location). Small-scale (10(1)m) variability between photo-quadrats characterized the coral reef community structure in JR compared with local- (10(2)m) and mesoscale (10(4)-10(5)m) variability. This finding suggests that biological processes (e.g., recruitment, competition) had primacy over hydrodynamics for driving the differences in reef community composition. However, the dominance of algae and low cover and diversity of scleractinian corals suggests the pervasive effects of global change on coral communities despite potential benefits provided by the MPA (e.g., oligotrophy and abundance of herbivores). There was no gradient of benthic community structure along the fore reef tract of JR; instead, a patchy distribution occurred in response to more subtle drivers acting at local scales. Overall, our multi-scale comparison was useful for differentiating the impacts of processes potentially impacting the JR reefs, thus providing important information to understand how reef communities are impacted by different environmental and anthropogenic stressors, and the potential benefits of MPAs.",0,2019,10.3389/fmars.2019.00747,WOS:000499801100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the study was not design to assess the efficiency of the MPA

Photographic assessment by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enables the consistent description of multiple habitats, in our case including mosaics of rock and sediment. As a case study, we used this method to survey the Greater Haig Fras marine conservation zone (Celtic Sea, northeast Atlantic). We distinguished 7 biotopes, detected statistically significant variations in standing stocks, species density, species diversity, and faunal composition, and identified significant indicator species for each habitat. Our results demonstrate that AUV-based photography can produce robust data for ecological research and practical marine conservation. Standardizing to a minimum number of individuals per sampling unit, rather than to a fixed seafloor area, may be a valuable means of defining an ecologically appropriate sampling unit. Although composite sampling represents a change in standard practice, other users should consider the potential benefits of this approach in conservation studies. It is broadly applicable in the marine environment and has been successfully implemented in deep-sea conservation and environmental impact studies. Without a cost-effective method, applicable across habitats, it will be difficult to further a coherent classification of biotopes or to routinely assess their conservation status in the rapidly expanding global extent of MPAs.",14,2019,10.1111/cobi.13312,WOS:000485281800019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

The 94 fish species registered were grouped in five trophic groups (TGs), the most abundant and conspicuous are the zoobenthos, zooplankton, and nekton feeders, while omnivorous and herbivorous are scarce. To determine the anthropogenic impacts, the population size, main activities, and infrastructure of each site were considered, resulting in four categories of disturbance: (WI) without impact, inside the REP; (LI) low impact; (MI) medium impact; and (HI) high impact, within the UYCR. Multivariate analyses combining physicochemical variables, community descriptors, and TGs by impact category segregated two groups, WI-LI, with high values of salinity, fish abundance, diversity of fish and TGs, and low values of nitrites, nitrates, and ammonia, from MI-HI with the contrary characteristics.

Within a year of receiving official protection under a co-management agreement, the island underwent a catastrophic bleaching event in 1998, and funding and enforcement in the protected area have been inconsistent since a restructuring of management in 2006. In this study, we investigate current health of the island's fish community, and report 186 observed fish species. We estimate that, including unseen species and those outside the study area, the total species richness may be comparable to the historical baseline of 244 species; however, this represents a decline from the 270 species estimated in 2001 and the 350 species observed in 2004, after several years of successful protections. Patterns of species richness over time likely reflect changes in management effectiveness and engagement of Misali's fishing communities. Diversity of indicator (Chaetodontidae) and keystone (Scarinae) taxa were comparable to historical levels and greatest inside the NEZ, suggesting continued reef health and resilience. However, we found no other significant differences between fish communities inside and outside the NEZ, which observations indicate is poorly enforced, and the disproportionate loss of large predatory fish species may indicate overfishing. The case study of Misali suggests that a temporary reduction in fishing pressure while the island was recovering from a severe bleaching event may have had long-lasting benefits for reef health and resilience. For future management, we recommend consideration of species-specific protections, a possible re-designation of NEZ boundaries to include more unique habitat types, and reintegration of local fishing communities into MPA co-management.",3,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104843,WOS:000477784400024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the control isinside the PPA

Technological advancements and fishery subsidies have granted ever-increasing access to populations of sharks, tunas, billfishes, and other predators. Wilderness refuges, defined here as areas beyond the detectable range of human influence, are therefore increasingly rare. In order to achieve marine resources sustainability, large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) with pelagic components are being implemented. However, such conservation efforts require knowledge of the critical habitats for predators, both across shallow reefs and the deeper ocean. Here, we fill this gap in knowledge across the Indo-Pacific by using 1,041 midwater baited videos to survey sharks and other pelagic predators such as rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata), mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), and black marlin (Istiompax indica). We modeled three key predator community attributes: vertebrate species richness, mean maximum body size, and shark abundance as a function of geomorphology, environmental conditions, and human pressures. All attributes were primarily driven by geomorphology (35%-62% variance explained) and environmental conditions (14%-49%). While human pressures had no influence on species richness, both body size and shark abundance responded strongly to distance to human markets (12%-20%). Refuges were identified at more than 1,250 km from human markets for body size and for shark abundance. These refuges were identified as remote and shallow seabed features, such as seamounts, submerged banks, and reefs. Worryingly, hotpots of large individuals and of shark abundance are presently under-represented within no-take MPAs that aim to effectively protect marine predators, such as the British Indian Ocean Territory. Population recovery of predators is unlikely to occur without strategic placement and effective enforcement of large no-take MPAs in both coastal and remote locations.",24,2019,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000366,WOS:000483408500011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,the study is not designed to anderstand the impact of MPA

Large differences in fish assemblages between the seasons in 2006 were not observed in subsequent 2014 surveys. Rather than any general shift towards greater topicalisation of the assemblage in warmer conditions, the difference between the assemblage sampled in the coldest sample period and the three warmer periods was a lower frequency of occurrence of both tropical and non-tropical species and decreased asymptotic species richness. Species that were otherwise rare, which consisted of a higher proportion of tropical species, were more likely to be absent in colder conditions. This was particularly so at the deepest and coldest location. Therefore, in this region warmer waters tend to increase the richness and abundance of most fish, but particularly rare tropical species.

This study assessed multiple long-standing (>70 years active) intra-lake FPAs in three lakes in eastern Ontario, Canada, to evaluate their potential conservation benefits. These FPAs were intended initially to protect exploited populations of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)), but since their establishment no empirical data have been collected to evaluate the effectiveness of FPAs for protecting bass or the broader fish community. A comparative biological census of fish species abundance, biomass and species richness was conducted using snorkelling surveys within FPAs, along the bordering transition zones, and in more distant non-protected areas of the lake that had similar habitats to the FPAs. In general, the FPAs yielded benefits that were most obvious (in terms of abundance and biomass) for the focal protected species (i.e. largemouth bass) as well as several shiner species. Largemouth bass and shiner abundance and biomass were highest in the FPA, lowest in the distant non-protected areas, and intermediate in the transition zone. Species richness was also highest in the FPAs in two of the three lakes. Collectively, these results support the use of FPAs as a viable and effective conservation strategy that extends beyond simply limiting the exploitation of a target species. Beyond the benefits afforded to fish within the FPA, evidence of spillover in adjacent areas was also observed, which is promising. Additional research is needed on the effectiveness of FPAs in a variety of regions and water-body types facing various threats in an effort to understand when, where and how to best use FPAs to benefit aquatic biodiversity.",4,2019,10.1002/aqc.3155,WOS:000475822100009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the studied areas are lakes

Higher abundances were registered in the northern transects coinciding with one of the most productive areas of the archipelago, situated north of Santa Cruz.

We investigated species diversity and phylogenetic relationships in these algae by sequencing three markers (psbA and rbcL genes, cox2,3 spacer), in conjunction with methods for algorithmic delimitation of species (ABGD and GMYC). Mediterranean subtidal Lithophyllum belong to a well-supported lineage, hereby called the L. stictiforme complex, which also includes two species described from the Atlantic, L. lobatum and L. searlesii. Our results indicate that the L. stictiforme complex consists of at least 13 species. Among the Mediterranean species, some are widely distributed and span most of the western and central Mediterranean, whereas others appear to be restricted to specific localities. These patterns are interpreted as possibly resulting from allopatric speciation events that took place during the Messinian Salinity Crisis and subsequent glacial periods. A partial rbcL sequence from the lectotype of L. stictiforme unambiguously indicates that this name applies to the most common subtidal Lithophyllum in the central Mediterranean.

To be effectively used, fish diversity assessments benefit from the use of integrated complementary approaches. Passive acoustics has received increasing attention as a non-invasive, long-term monitoring tool, as it uses biological sounds produced incidentally or intentionally as natural tags to identify and estimate animal diversity. In the marine environment, there is little evidence about the link between taxonomic diversity (different species) and acoustic diversity (different sound types). Here we used underwater visual census fish data collected over multiple years from 3 sites within a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area as comprehensive information on local fish assemblages to be compared with acoustic recordings obtained in September 2015. Richness, diversity and community similarity indices as well as abundance analyses revealed a strong relationship between taxonomic diversity and acoustic diversity. Overall, acoustic communities showed pronounced differences between the study sites that were not observed in the respective taxonomic assemblages. Despite the lower number of sound type categories (12) compared to taxa (53) and the short recording period, passive acoustics showed a high discriminating potential, which supports its suitability as a complementary approach to visual-based surveys.

In this study we collected data on mixed-species hunting groups composed primarily of piscivorous fishes (species composition, abundance, behavioral interactions) and used both multivariate and network analyses to quantify pair-wise and guild level behavioral relationships. Our results indicate that such collective behaviors exhibit consistent patterns of associations (33 species with 282 pair-wise links within the observed network) with 10 dominant species accounting for 60% of pair-wise interactions. Species richness within groups varied (mean = 2.4, range 2-6 species) as did group size (mean = 8.1 individuals, range 2-80). Mixed-species groups, in general, were composed of species representing morphologically diverse forms that appeared to enhance access to shelter sites and implement diverse strategies for prey capture. It is noteworthy that the composition of groups did not reflect the relative abundances of their component species within the overall community of fishes, suggesting that group membership was an elective choice. The identification of these patterns, assuming they are persistent features of these communities, can be used as a foundation for studies to assess dynamics of mixed-species relationships, rates of predator success based on group membership, demographic consequences, and responses to variations in habitat attributes and associated prey resources. Such information could be used to interpret the nature of multispecies interactions within predator communities and potentially aid in conservation and management.",1,2019,10.1590/1982-0224-20180165,WOS:000463223500001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Parasites can indicate fishery effects on host species and also on the whole local community, but the effects of fisheries and protection measures on parasite communities are relatively unknown. This study analyses parasite communities of the white seabream Diplodus sargus sargus in order to assess potential effects exerted by protection measures within and by fisheries outside a reserve in the western Mediterranean Sea. This small scale analysis offered the opportunity to study different degrees of fishery effects on parasite infracommunities, without considering climatic effects as an additional factor. Parasite infracommunities of fishes from the no-take zone (NTZ) differed in their composition and structure compared with areas completely or partially open to fisheries. The detected spatial differences in the infracommunities derived from generalist parasites and varied slightly between transmission strategies. Monoxenous parasites were richer and more diverse in both fished areas, but more abundant in the no-take, whereas richness and abundance of heteroxenous parasites were higher for the NTZ.

Despite this status, this region is still poorly studied in comparison to other marine hotspots. To start filling this gap, we attempt to provide a global overview of reef-fish diversity around the numerous islands of the region. We evaluated species richness, the abundance and biomass, and the functional diversity of the fish assemblages for the major islands of the GC. We first highlight that the southwestern part of the central GC is the hotspot of reef-fishes diversity within the GC, in terms of species richness, functional diversity, and fish abundance. We then found out an important functional divergence between fish assemblages of northern and southern regions. The fish biomass of each region is dominated by different species, characterised by different ecological traits (the opposite of functional convergence). This functional divergence may be explained by an important oceanographic heterogeneity along the latitudinal axis of the GC. The northern part shows larger climate fluctuations while the southern part is more tropical and climatically stable. Such functional divergence is a biodiversity facet to take into account when determining the sites to focus conservation action. In the GC, this criterion allows the importance of some sites to be highlighted to preserve the legacy of the reef-fishes, despite their lower diversity levels. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Analyses of FD offer a potentially useful tool to identify functional changes in diverse, complex, and disturbed marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, yet this metric is rarely applied to evaluate community change. Here, we documented spatio-temporal variability in the trophic function of fish assemblages to identify changes in coral reef communities inside the Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) in the U.S. Virgin Islands between 2002 and 2010, which included an intense coral bleaching event in 2005. We combined six trait categories related to the trophic function of 95 fish species together with species biomass estimated from underwater surveys to calculate assemblage-level descriptors of functional richness (FRic), dispersion (FDis), and evenness. We tested the effects of habitat type, time, and their interaction on fish FD using a non-parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance. We found statistically significant differences for FRic and FDis between habitat types and survey years. Coral reef and other hard bottom areas supported highest levels of trophic functional richness and variation, but low functional redundancy. Fish species exhibited high functional uniqueness within the functional trait space suggesting that a significant decline in fish diversity in the BIRNM would likely result in loss of trophic functions from the fish community. Detection of temporal variations in functional trait composition subsequent to the mass coral bleaching event in 2005 indicates that FD descriptors are sensitive enough to track shifts in the emergent trophic organization of fish communities. In the BIRNM, the trophic organization in fish assemblages did not return to the pre-bleaching state even after five years of monitoring. We demonstrate a novel way to monitor resilience to disturbance by plotting and tracking the centroid of the functional trait space through time. Our findings demonstrate the utility of FD descriptors to evaluate changes to the functional integrity of diverse and spatially heterogeneous habitat structure across the seascape.",7,2018,10.1002/ecs2.2433,WOS:000449566200034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Sampling was conducted at two habitat types (Posidonia oceanica meadows and rocky reefs) that occur at sites of different protection level with respect to fisheries (high protection: seasonal no-take zone within the MPA; intermediate: zones within the MPA where small-scale fishing is allowed; none: areas outside the MPA, where all types of fishing are allowed, including trawlers, purse seiners, and recreational fishing). The data were used to examine the effects of protection level and habitat type on community parameters, trophic structure and functional diversity of fish populations that occupy the upper sublittoral zone.

We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4 degrees colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, Prionace glauca. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below similar to 750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth.

The invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum was first found on the northern edge of Georges Bank in 1998. It can form encrusting colonies on gravel substrates that are also a preferred habitat for a number of other invertebrates. In this study we used data collected via HabCam, a vessel-towed underwater imaging system, to investigate the distribution of D. vexillum and its relationship to other epibenthic macroinvertebrates in a portion of Georges Bank that includes fishing grounds and an area protected from bottom-fishing. This novel technology provides imaging of epibenthic species distributions in areas of the benthic environment that were previously unobservable. We found that D. vexillum density is negatively correlated with the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus), barnacles (genus Balanus), the tube anemone (genus Cerianthus), the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), the globular sponge of the genus Polymastia, and Bryozoa. However D. vexillum is positively correlated with Cancer spp. Crabs, the tube forming polychaete, Filograna implexa, and Asterias spp. sea stars. The hypothesis that D. vexillum restructures the invertebrate community is supported by principal components analysis, revealing it as a primary driver of variation in the community when present. Additionally, there is an effect of the closed area as compared to fishing grounds on the structure of the invertebrate community and the abundance of certain species as consistent with previous studies, bottom-fishing affects invertebrate community structure. Principal components analysis revealed that bottom-fishing also appears to weaken clustering among species in the invertebrate community as compared to the community structure in the closed area. Biodiversity in high gravel sites of the epibenthic environment, as measured by the Shannon diversity index, also declined with increasing D. vexillum percent cover, while the open and closed areas were not significantly different in their level of biodiversity. D. vexillum appears to be the key driver of biodiversity decline in the epibenthos when present, rather than other processes such as direct disturbance and extraction from dredging.

The literary and original data on the state of benthos in the area from the Kerch Strait to Adler were examined. The studied area of the Utrish Natural Reserve included habitats that are common along the coast (an active cliff, a narrow pebble beach, boulder deposits, rock bench and soft sediments). Only two of the three well-known Black Sea belt macrozoobenthic biocoenoses were observed along the northeastern Black Sea coast: the shallow-water venus sand and the deep-water phaseolina silt. The third biocoenosis (mussel mud) was not noted neither in the reserve's area nor in the studied part of the shelf to the south of Novorossiysk. Of these three belts only venus sand was found in the Utrish Nature Reserve's marine area. The absence of the mussel belt in the studied area of the reserve is typical for the southern part of the North Caucasian coast in the current period and thus does not affect the presentability of the reserve's benthic ecosystem. The biocoenosis of the bivalves Pitar rudis - Gouldia minima was common at the muddy sand with shells in both reserve's and reference sites' middle-depths complex instead of the mussel belt which was typical for the 20th century. Its boundary was 10 m deeper in the reserve compared to the reference sites. The absence of the Modiolula phaseolina belt in the area of the reserve could be explained by the insufficient width of the protected marine area (up to 52 m depth); due to this the deep-water complex in the reserve is actually represented by a narrow strip. Extension of the reserve's boundary over the depth of 70 m will include this biocoenosis into the Protected Area, which would significantly increase the presentability of the reserve's marine part for the North Caucasian coast. The biogeographical composition of the reserve's flora, its species diversity and structure in general corresponds to that of the whole region. The macrophyte zone consists of four belts: upper (0-2 m, Dictyota fasciola f. repens + Polysiphonia opaca + Ceramium ciliatum + Ulva compressa), upper mid (2-12 m, Cystoseira crinita + Cystoseira barbata - Cladostephus spongiosus - Ellisolandia elongata), lower mid (12-18 m, Phyllophora crispa, Codium vermilara and Bonnemaisonia hamifera), and the lower belt (below 18 m) formed by a recent invader, B. hamifera. The majority of species found in the reserve's marine area are common species of the Black Sea macrophytobenthos. However, the Utrish Nature Reserve includes more favourable habitats for macrophytes than most of the North Caucasian coast, because the typical macrophyte Cystoseira spp. have been noted at greater depths in the reserve, in comparison to the remaining shelf.",2,2018,10.24189/ncr.2018.065,WOS:000453601500001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of species richness or other usable biodiversity indicator

There is no consensus regarding the ideal size of MPAs, and actually there is some evidence that perhaps size is not as critical as other specific factors in determining their success in terms of populations' protection and ecological functions conservation. On the other hand, depending on the objectives, zones with different classification regimes in terms of rules and uses might enable the maintenance of the intended uses.At this light, we examined the case of the small (605 002 m(2)) rocky shore area of Avencas, near Lisbon, on the Atlantic western Coast of Portugal, which was classified as Biophysical Interest Zone (ZIBA) in 1998, due to its exceptional intertidal biodiversity, after what its protection status became controversial, leading to conflicts with the local population and incompliance with extant regulations. From 2010 efforts were carried out by local authorities to reclassify Avencas as Marine Protected Area, which was achieved in 2016.Monitoring intertidal communities in a MPA and adjacent areas is an effective and low-cost procedure to evaluate the evolution of the biodiversity of rocky shores. Therefore, antedating the creation of the new MPA, assessments of the ZIBA biodiversity were conducted from January 2013 to December 2015 on a monthly basis. This timeline was selected as a function of a change in visitors' behavior induced from 2013 by several management and outreach initiatives, which increased in a certain extent the user's compliance with regulations.A positive evolution was expected for density and/or species diversity of the different groups analysed (flora, sessile fauna and mobile fauna) in this three years period. However, a very strong storm occurred in 2014 produced a significant impact and changed large areas of the Avencas rocky shore. As a consequence, results did not display a recognizable recovery pattern of the intertidal communities, and following that extreme event are not even consistent with a hypothesized enhanced recovery capability of the ecosystem in a protected area. This suggests that longer data series are necessary to obtain more robust data regarding natural variability, since alterations caused by extreme events are always likely to occur. Additionally, results illustrate that indeed size matters because it influences the MPA openness, expressed as the ratio of periphery to area, and therefore its susceptibility to external driving forces. Such considerations must be taken into account in any management plan, which in this case should encompass an increase in the intertidal protected area, a new conditioned small-scale fishing regime, and an adequate monitoring programme to evaluate the effectiveness of the new management scheme.",0,2017,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.028,WOS:000417229100046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,data are not consistent beceause of a storm that occured during the sampling period

Underwater Visual Census techniques (UVC) are used to monitor fish assemblages in MPAs. UVCs should be adapted to fish abundance, body-size and behaviour, which can strongly affect fish detectability. In Mediterranean subtidal habitats, however, UVC strip transects of one surface area (25x5 m(2)) are commonly used to survey the whole fish assemblage, from large shy fish to small crypto-benthic fish. Most high trophic level predators (HTLPs) are large shy fish which rarely swim close to divers and, consequently, their abundance may be under-estimated with commonly used transects. Here, we propose an improvement to traditional transect surveys to better account for differences in behaviour among and within species. First, we compared the effectiveness of combining two transect surface areas (large: 35x20 m(2); medium: 25x5 m(2)) in quantifying large, shy fish within and outside Mediterranean MPAs. We identified species-specific body-size thresholds defining a smaller and a larger size class better sampled by medium and large transects respectively. Combining large and medium transects provided more accurate biomass and species richness estimates for large, shy species than using medium transects alone. We thus combined the new approach with two other transect surface areas commonly used to survey crypto-benthic (10x1 m(2)) and necto-benthic (25x5 m(2)) species in order to assess how effectively MPAs protection the whole fish assemblage. We verified that MPAs offer significant protection for HTLPs, their response in terms of biomass and density increase in MPAs was always higher in magnitude than other functional groups. Inside MPAs, the contribution of HTLP reached >25% of total fish biomass, against <2% outside MPAs. Surveys with multiple transect surface areas allow for a more realistic assessment of the structure of the whole fish assemblage and better assessment of potential recovery of HTLPs within reserves of HTLP.",19,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0178511,WOS:000402923200036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,only 8 species were assessed

However, the relationship between terrestrial and marine systems has rarely been considered in terrestrial and marine reserve design. Seagrasses are affected by land-based activities due to their proximity to terrestrial systems and sensitivity to fluxes of terrestrially-derived organic and inorganic material. Our study examines how land use patterns adjacent to seagrass meadows influence the ecological integrity of seagrass using a suite of seagrass condition metrics on a landscape level across the Philippine archipelago. Using canonical correlation analysis, we measured the association between environmental variables (land use and seagrass abiotic conditions) with biotic variables (seagrass species richness and abundance). Terrestrial protection adjacent to seagrass meadows, defined as the absence of various anthropogenic land use perturbations, had significant positive effects on seagrass condition. The watershed area, and area of farmland and human development, had the most negative effect on seagrass condition. Using analysis of covariance and regression, we examined how marine protected area (MPA) establishment, size, and age, affected seagrass biotic conditions while holding environmental conditions constant. The relationship between biological and environmental canonical factors did not vary as a function of an MPA. This study provides evidence that land use is more important than marine protection for tropical seagrass condition. Our results demonstrate the complementary connection between land and sea, justifying the 'ridge-to-reef approach in coastal conservation. Proper management of seagrasses should account for stewardship of the adjacent watersheds. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Controversy over spillover often exists because it is difficult to discern empirically. In addition, of those studies that have provided empirical evidence, nearly all are from shallow reef ecosystems. Here we examined 2 deepwater MPAs in the main Hawaiian Islands, established to benefit a complex of species called the 'Deep 7.' To study these fishes, we used baited cameras and commercial fishery data. Relative abundance, fish size, and species richness observed using camera data declined with distance from MPAs, signifying that species had begun to spill over the MPA boundaries into fishing grounds. Further, temporal analyses of these spatial trends indicated that they did not always exist but developed in the fifth and sixth years of sampling. Changes in fish size over time supported these results, with asymptotes in fish size seen inside and increases seen outside MPAs in the fifth and sixth years of sampling. Displaced fishing effort may have also caused initial declines in Etelis coruscans size and catch data that increased in later years. Further, low sample sizes and public announcements prior to sampling in Year 8 may have contributed to the decline in E. carbunculus sizes inside, and spatial trends outside, an MPA that were no longer significant in Year 8.

At each site, shallow subtidal rocks (N = 1289 total) were lifted, organisms recorded, and rocks replaced in their original position. Biodiversity indices were calculated to evaluate how diversity varied with location within the lough, frequency of sampling disturbance, degree of hypoxia/anoxia, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and number of rocks turned. The richness of solitary invertebrates surveyed in situ averaged 21 taxa per site with significantly more in the South Basin (near the lough's connection to the ocean) than in the North Basin.

Seascape context (i.e. the spatial arrangement of ecosystems) mediates the effects of reserves on fish abundance, species richness and ecological processes in shallow coral reef and mangrove ecosystems; however, it is unclear whether this interaction exerts similar effects on reserves in other ecosystems. This study used baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to test for combined effects of seascape context and reserves on fish abundance in seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We demonstrate that the composition of harvested fishes in seagrass meadows was different in reserves and fished areas. Specifically, in reserves there was enhanced abundance of exploited rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens, a functionally important herbivore in local seagrass meadows. These reserve effects are not influenced by the area of seagrass meadows or seascape context they occur in (i.e. their spatial proximity to other ecosystems or the ocean). However, seascape context was directly correlated with the spatial distribution of harvested rabbitfish and emperors Lethrinus spp., which were more abundant in seagrass meadows nearer to the open ocean. Our results show that reserves and seascape context can shape spatial patterns in the abundance of harvested fishes in seagrass meadows, and that these effects may be operating on different components of fish assemblages.

We found that sharks were significantly more diverse, more abundant, larger in size and greater in biomass in the marine reserve relative to the Scott Reefs. Consistent with a priori hypotheses, bony fishes displayed greater species diversity, abundance and biomass where sharks were common relative to the predator-depleted location.

Coral representation is roughly proportional to spatial extent of reserves in different regions. The proportion of species with joint distributions in reserves and non-reserves ranges between 0% and 27% of the regional species pool; this may be a reflection of the high species turnover between sampling sites, and to some extent may also reflect sparse sampling coverage.

The first broad biological evaluation of the network's performance, using deep-water octocorals, indicates that whilst the level of species representation is broadly proportional to the network's spatial coverage, reserves do not appear to be areas of significantly higher octocoral biodiversity compared to areas outside reserves and that there is low species representation within highly protected (IUCN I or II) zones.

The recent development of baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) provide an alternative quantitative sampling method.

Our study explored possible reasons for this, including using horizontal BRUVs and various baits across a depth gradient. We examined the fish fauna in, and adjacent to, a small, but long-established, no-take marine reserve to assess the potential for BRUVs to enhance monitoring programs in exposed coastal environments. Significant differences in the fish assemblage were described relating to location, depth and bait type, with pilchards being an effective bait type. Fish abundance and species richness increased with depth. The research validated BRUVs for monitoring deep-reef systems in Tasmania, reinforced the importance of depth in structuring fish assemblages and identified the range of observable species in this region that may not be fully captured with diver-based surveys alone.

Given that the frequency, intensity and duration of these events are poised to increase due to the global climate change, understanding the ecological impacts of such erratic occurrences becomes imperative to devise better management strategies. The eventful passage of the tropical cyclone, Phyan, along the northwestern coast of India in November 2009, coupled with the availability of historical data presented a rare opportunity to elucidate the consequences on the polychaete assemblages of the Malvan Marine Sanctuary and their subsequent recovery. This was achieved by comparison of the pre- and post-Phyan seasonal data from four different sites in and around the Sanctuary. MDS analyses and polychaete community parameters suggested conspicuous cyclone related effects on the polychaete community characteristics in the three outer stations off Malvan, whereas the relatively protected bay station remained more or less unscathed. Impacts, attributable to the cyclone apart from seasonal variations, included changes in polychaete composition, reductions in total polychaete density, species diversity, evenness and functional groups. Dominance of the opportunistic polychaete, Paraprionospiopatiens was all pervasive just after Phyan, resulting in poor diversity and evenness values. In the outer stations, diverse feeding modes present prior to the cyclone were replaced by microphagous feeders post the disturbance. However, the study also observed complete recovery as substantiated by the improvement inpolychaete density, diversity indices and reinstatement of multiple feeding guilds in affected areas. This resilience of the coastal waters off Malvan is attributed to its marine protected status, implying that reduced human interference aided rapid revival of damaged ecosystems.",8,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0159368,WOS:000382258100006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pseudoreplication

Although the processes that enhance green tides in response to nutrient enrichment are well known, their consequences for ecological communities -especially for ichthyofauna- remain poorly studied. To estimate these consequences, this analysis focused on the two types of shallow systems that are experiencing green tides: sandy beaches and estuarine mudflats. In these two systems, macroalgae proliferation and fish community were surveyed along seasonal cycles at control and impacted sites that shared similar physicochemical parameters and sediment structure. To analyse the consequences of green tides on the fish community, a Before-After Control-Impact approach was used. This approach reveals no difference between fish communities at the control and impacted sites before the macroalgal bloom. Then, it underlines an influence of green tides on the fish community, and this influence varies according to the composition, density and duration of the macroalgal bloom. Indeed, when intertidal systems experienced short proliferation and/or weak density, green tides did not seem to impact the fish community. However, when green macroalgae proliferated in large quantities and/or when the proliferation lasted for long periods, the fish community was significantly affected. These modifications in the fish community led to a significant decrease in fish species diversity and density until fish disappeared from impacted sites at high proliferations. Furthermore, the response of fish species to green tides differed according to their functional guilds. Negative consequences for benthic and marine juvenile fish species were beginning at low proliferations, whereas for pelagic fish species they occurred only at high proliferations. Thus, green tides significantly affect fish habitat suitability because they lead to changes in the composition of the fish community and eventually to the local disappearance of fish at high proliferations.

In this study, we investigated variation in scleractinian coral taxonomic richness and community diversity in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) at different spatial scales. We sampled corals in 331 sites across nine countries. Sites were pooled into 11 distinct subregions based on previous investigations on coral community structure and between closures and reefs open to fishing for five regions with sufficient closure replication. We analyzed similarities in coral communities and compared differences in mean richness and Shannon diversity. Significant differences in alpha and beta components of diversity were tested at multiple spatial scales and between management types against a random distribution null model. Rarefaction was used to investigate significant difference in total taxonomic richness among regions. Coral communities were mainly structured along Acropora and massive Porites dominance lines. Highest dissimilarity among coral communities was found at the regional level and within- and between-subregion variations accounted for most of the coral diversity. Beta components were responsible for higher proportions of taxonomic richness of which a large part was explained by the site-region interaction. Alpha diversity contributed most to Shannon diversity and site level richness and Shannon diversity had similar relationships with latitude, peaking at about 10 degrees S. Alpha diversity also showed significant relationship with water temperature variability, peaking at a sea surface temperature standard deviation of about 1.4 degrees C, corresponding to the same 10 degrees S latitude. Relatively higher alpha and beta components contributed to high richness and Shannon diversity in three regions: southern Kenya-northern Tanzania, southern Tanzania-northern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar-Mayotte.

A series of descriptive field studies were performed to assess fish and benthic communities between two areas within a newly established MPA in SW Portugal. We characterized benthic macroalgal composition and determined the size, density and biomass of the main benthic predatory and herbivorous fish species as well as the main benthic herbivorous invertebrates to assess indications of top-down control on the phytobenthic assemblages. Fish species were identical inside and outside the MPA, in both cases Sarpa salpa was the most abundant fish herbivore and Diplodus spp. accounted for the great majority of the benthic predators. However, size and biomass of D. spp. were higher inside than outside the MPA. The main herbivorous invertebrate was the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which was smaller and predominantly showing a crevice-dwelling behaviour in the MPA. In addition, P. lividus size frequency distribution showed a unimodal pattern outside and a bimodal pattern inside the MPA. We found significant differences in the algal assemblages between inside and outside the MPA, with higher abundance of turf and foliose algae inside, and articulated calcareous and corticated macrophytes outside the MPA, but no differences in the invasive Asparagopsis spp. The obtained results show differences in predatory fish and benthic community structure, but not in species richness, inside and outside the MPA. We hypothesize these differences lead to variation in species interactions: directly through predation and indirectly via affecting sea urchins behavioural patterns, predators might drive changes in macroalgal assemblages via trophic cascade in the study area. However due to non-biological differences between the two areas it is difficult to suggest that the MPA causes increased biological parameters of targeted species and to assess predatory control and trophic cascade effects in areas where fishing pressure is reduced. It is therefor advisable to design MPAs so that their impacts can be scientifically evaluated in a proper fashion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative data on the epibenthic taxa which contributes to the biodiversity value of these continental shelf margins is vital for the effectiveness of these efforts, especially at the spatial resolution required to effectively manage these ecosystems. We quantified the diversity of morphotype classes on an outcropping reef system characteristic of the continental shelf margin in the Flinders Commonwealth Marine Reserve, southeastern Australia. The system is uniquely characterized by long linear outcropping ledge features in sedimentary bedrock that differ markedly from the surrounding low-profile, sand-inundated reefs. We characterize a reef system harboring rich morphotype classes, with a total of 55 morphotype classes identified from the still images captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle. The morphotype class Cnidaria/Bryzoa/Hydroid matrix dominated the assemblages recorded. Both alpha and beta diversity declined sharply with distance from nearest outcropping reef ledge feature. Patterns of the morphotype classes were characterized by (1) morphotype turnover at scales of 5 to 10s m from nearest outcropping reef ledge feature, (2) 30 % of morphotype classes were recorded only once (i.e. singletons), and (3) generally low levels of abundance (proportion cover) of the component morphotype class. This suggests that the assemblages in this region contain a considerable number of locally rare morphotype classes. This study highlights the particular importance of outcropping reef ledge features in this region, as they provide a refuge against sediment scouring and inundation common on the low profile reef that characterizes this region. As outcropping reef features, they represent a small fraction of overall reef habitat yet contain much of the epibenthic faunal diversity. This study has relevance to conservation planning for continental shelf habitats, as protecting a single, or few, areas of reef is unlikely to accurately represent the geomorphic diversity of cross-shelf habitats and the morphotype diversity that is associated with these features. Equally, when designing monitoring programs these spatially-discrete, but biologically rich outcropping reef ledge features should be considered as distinct components in stratified sampling designs.",9,2016,10.1007/s10531-016-1058-1,WOS:000372298800005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Considering the biology of the species listed and the distance from the coast of the Port-Cros Archipelago, it is unlikely that this increase in species richness has resulted from colonisation events through the implementation and enforcement of effective protection of the area but is rather due to an increase in sampling effort. In contrast to other Mediterranean areas, the populations of Fucales are still highly diversified and stable. Only one species, C. brachycarpa var. brachycarpa, has declined in the 1-10-m depth zone in relation to the proliferation of herbivorous species, possibly enhanced by the PNPC conservation strategy. The overall good conservation of Fucales populations of the PCNP is probably the result of the absence of habitat destruction, high seawater quality and the regulation of human activities (fishing, tourism, diving).",27,2016,10.7872/crya/v37.iss1.2016.61,WOS:000377603900006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

However, the dimensions of these variations are rarely being quantified despite their strong implications for ecosystem functioning and conservation of exploited stocks. Ignoring these predictable changes hinders the identification of structuring forces of fish assemblages and may lead to incorrect interpretations of the results and evaluation of habitats. To assess natural variation on short timescales, fish assemblages at a small tropical island (Chumbe Island, Tanzania) in the western Indo-Pacific were investigated and compared among two coastal habitats (coral reef and seagrass bed) at different lunar, diel, and tidal phases using underwater visual census methods. Results of multivariate analyses suggested two distinct fish communities in the two habitat types with the coral reef comprising a higher species richness and heterogeneity than the seagrass bed. In the coral reef, community composition and trophic diversity was influenced by all three natural cycles, while in the seagrass bed they were mainly driven by tidal phases. Mean fish densities were slightly different in the two habitat types during daytime but increased significantly in the seagrass bed during twilight hours. For the investigated habitats on Chumbe Island our results indicate that (i) through their routine migrations mobile fishes can provide important functional links between habitats, (ii) seagrass beds have lower species richness and diversity, and emphasize that (iii) fish movement governed by natural cycles can cause predictable short-term variations in fish communities.

Nonetheless, the remote Darwin and Wolf Islands are still in a near natural state harboring high species richness unique for the archipelago and high biomass. Marine life that aggregates to the pinnacles linked to the wider oceanic seascape makes them interesting and unique systems in terms of community structure and study of on-shore/offshore trophic interactions. Although >200 km from local fishing ports the two islands also support an artisanal fishery targeting large demersal predators of high trophic levels. They are areas prioritized for conservation actions by Galapagos National Park, and local non-governmental organizations given their natural heritage importance, value to local fishers and revenue from dive tourism attracted by the promise of large marine predator aggregations such as sharks. Given that catch data upon which to base conservation recommendations is sparse it is difficult to accurately estimate present day fishing trends in Darwin and Wolf. We used atrophic steady-state model that connects benthic and pelagic communities to assess the potential effects of a change in fishing intensity in the two islands system. A predator-prey matrix was built using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software with total biomass estimated at 937 t km(-2). Large fish aggregations accounted for 19%, primary producers for 9.0% and non-fish (seabirds, marine mammals and sea turtles) for less than 0.1% of the total living biomass. The total system size in terms of overall flows was 16,652 t km(-2) year(-1), four times larger than a generic seamount model but smaller than that modeled for a Galapagos upwelling system based upon the western Bolivar Channel region. Consumption and respiration dominated the flows in the system (53.4 and 31.8% respectively). The Darwin and Wolf system shows a mature state, dominated by respiration, and top-down control via sharks and benthic predatory fish as the most important system compartments in terms of biomass. Model simulations suggest that heavy fishing pressure on top predators would greatly change the system's trophic structure. The nature of impacts depended on the types of gears simulated. Reduced natural predator densities through fishing exert strong direct and indirect influences on the system towards sea urchin-dominated benthos.

C.",Reef flattening effects on total richness and species responses in the Caribbean,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,"There has been ongoing flattening of Caribbean coral reefs with the loss of habitat having severe implications for these systems. Complexity and its structural components are important to fish species richness and community composition, but little is known about its role for other taxa or species-specific responses. This study reveals the importance of reef habitat complexity and structural components to different taxa of macrofauna, total species richness, and individual coral and fish species in the Caribbean. Species presence and richness of different taxa were visually quantified in one hundred 25-m(2) plots in three marine reserves in the Caribbean. Sampling was evenly distributed across five levels of visually estimated reef complexity, with five structural components also recorded: the number of corals, number of large corals, slope angle, maximum sponge and maximum octocoral height. Taking advantage of natural heterogeneity in structural complexity within a particular coral reef habitat (Orbicella reefs) and discrete environmental envelope, thus minimizing other sources of variability, the relative importance of reef complexity and structural components was quantified for different taxa and individual fish and coral species on Caribbean coral reefs using boosted regression trees (BRTs). Boosted regression tree models performed very well when explaining variability in total (823%), coral (806%) and fish species richness (773%), for which the greatest declines in richness occurred below intermediate reef complexity levels. Complexity accounted for very little of the variability in octocorals, sponges, arthropods, annelids or anemones. BRTs revealed species-specific variability and importance for reef complexity and structural components. Coral and fish species occupancy generally declined at low complexity levels, with the exception of two coral species (Pseudodiploria strigosa and Porites divaricata) and four fish species (Halichoeres bivittatus, H.maculipinna, Malacoctenus triangulatus and Stegastes partitus) more common at lower reef complexity levels. A significant interaction between country and reef complexity revealed a non-additive decline in species richness in areas of low complexity and the reserve in Puerto Rico. Flattening of Caribbean coral reefs will result in substantial species losses, with few winners. Individual structural components have considerable value to different species, and their loss may have profound impacts on population responses of coral and fish due to identity effects of key species, which underpin population richness and resilience and may affect essential ecosystem processes and services.",49,2015,10.1111/1365-2656.12429,WOS:000362741000023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Such increases in the density of potential competitors can cause generalist predators to contract the scope of their diets. This study investigated the effects of increased conspecific fish density on the diets of gopher rockfish Sebastes carnatus at a 35 yr old MPA in Point Lobos, California, and at 4 newly established MPAs in Ano Nuevo, Point Lobos, Piedras Blancas, and Point Buch on in central California. Analyses were conducted for 707 stomachs collected from 2007 to 2009. Diets did not differ inside versus outside the old Point Lobos MPA in terms of prey richness, evenness, composition, or gopher rockfish trophic level. However, fish outside the MPA had greater levels of individual specialization. No consistent differences in these metrics were observed inside versus outside the 4 new MPAs, although prey composition and evenness did differ significantly among geographic locations. Diets at Ano Nuevo, the most northern and shallow location, consisted predominantly of Cancer spp. and porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae), while diets from southern, deeper locations were dominated by brittle stars (Ophiuroidea). The case study of the old Point Lobos MPA indicates that fish feeding ecology may not change in an MPA after several decades.

P.",Functional traits reveal early responses in marine reserves following protection from fishing,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,,"AimEvaluating the effectiveness of marine reserves in achieving conservation goals is challenged by the decadal scales over which biological systems respond following protection. Given that trophic interactions underpin community responses following protection and that complex ecological interactions make responses difficult to identify, quantifying changes in species traits may provide detail missed by traditional diversity measures, including information relevant to ecosystem functioning. We determine whether this is the case by comparing community metrics based on functional traits to taxonomic diversity measures associated with no take' marine reserves and partially protected, fished areas along eight degrees of latitude.LocationEighteen no take' marine reserves and 14 partially protected, fished areas along the east coast of Australia.MethodWe use two independent datasets from shallow and deep coastal rocky reefs to analyse trait-based metrics and taxonomic diversity from sites inside reserves to sites in partially protected, fished areas.ResultsTaxonomic diversity (species diversity and richness) and trait-based multimetrics (functional richness and dispersion) showed no difference with level of protection. Total fish abundance responded positively to protection, but only on shallow reefs. Comparing values of individual functional traits implied a return of larger bodied species of fish in protected areas and an increase in trophic level. The latter was significant on deeper reefs and was strongly correlated with age of protected area. Thus, recovery responses were largely associated with community mean functional trait values, highlighting the value of trait-based approaches for detecting change, when no differences in traditional taxonomic diversity measures were apparent.Main conclusionsWe empirically demonstrate that functional traits can elucidate early conservation outcomes, when traditional multimetric diversity indices do not distinguish protected and fished communities. Ecologically relevant but sensitive metrics are fundamental to allow information to be incorporated into adaptive management strategies, which often occur on political rather than biological time-scales.",39,2015,10.1111/ddi.12309,WOS:000358370900003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the control is a PPA (called ""habitat protection zone"")"

Many countries routinely collect data on fish occurrence as part of stock assessments, and it has been suggested that this data could be a surrogate for other components.

However, incorporating data on fish richness collected at the same time and spatial scale (c.2km) as the video data demonstrated a small increase (c.10%) in predictability. The ability of environmental variables to predict epibenthic richness varied within and across locations, from 32% to 72% variability explained, despite the presence of strong environmental gradients.Main conclusionDemersal fish taxon richness, especially derived from stock assessments, was not a useful surrogate for epibenthic invertebrate taxon richness. Environmental data were more useful in predicting epibenthic richness, especially for habitat-structuring taxa observed on video. Our findings suggest that the need to manage large areas of the seafloor seems most likely to be met in future by species distribution and habitat suitability mapping.

We also considered the effects of 6 covariatesMPA size and age, MPA size and age interaction, latitude, total species richness, and level of protectionon each metric. Some common metrics, such as species richness and Shannon diversity, did not differ consistently between MPA and control sites, whereas other metrics, such as total abundance and biomass, were consistently different across studies. Metric responses derived from the biomass data sets were more consistent than those based on the abundance data sets, suggesting that community-level biomass differs more predictably than abundance between MPA and control sites. Covariate analyses indicated that level of protection, latitude, MPA size, and the interaction between MPA size and age affect metric performance. These results highlight a handful of metrics, several of which are little known, that could be used to meet the increasing demand for community-level indicators of MPA effectiveness.Uso de Medidas a Nivel de Comunidad para Monitorear los Efectos de las areas Marinas Protegidas sobre la Biodiversidad Las areas marinas protegidas (AMP) son usadas para proteger especies, comunidades y sus habitats asociados, ademas de tener otros objetivos.

We used underwater visual surveys of coral reef fish and benthic communities to quantify the short-to medium-term (5 to 30 years) ecological effects of the establishment of NTMRs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). The density, mean length, and biomass of principal fishery species, coral trout (Plectropomus spp., Variola spp.), were consistently greater in NTMRs than on fished reefs over both the short and medium term. However, there were no clear or consistent differences in the structure of fish or benthic assemblages, nontarget fish density, fish species richness, or coral cover between NTMR and fished reefs. There was no indication that the displacement and concentration of fishing effort reduced coral trout populations on fished reefs. A severe tropical cyclone impacted many survey reefs during the study, causing similar declines in coral cover and fish density on both NTMR and fished reefs. However, coral trout biomass declined only on fished reefs after the cyclone. The GBRMP is performing as expected in terms of the protection of fished stocks and biodiversity for a developed country in which fishing is not excessive and targets a narrow range of species. NTMRs cannot protect coral reefs directly from acute regional-scale disturbance but, after a strong tropical cyclone, impacted NTMR reefs supported higher biomass of key fishery-targeted species and so should provide valuable sources of larvae to enhance population recovery and long-term persistence.",78,2015,10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.073,WOS:000353351900019,field,BACI,mix,mix,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,NA,NA,2004,FPA,fully,NA,NA,NA,NA,Australia,tropical,Oceania,South Pacific Ocean,coral reef,,ecological,fish,,,,,,,biodiversity,,species richness,figure 2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"effect size is indicated but was calculated with the median and not the mean, in shore values kept"

Eighteen species were exclusively found inside the caves: they were mainly represented by speleophilic (i.e. species preferentially or exclusively inhabiting caves) gobids (e.g. Didogobius splechtnai) and nocturnal species (e.g. Conger conger). Forty-one species were censused outside, 20 of which were shared with cave habitats.

The magnitude and timing of changes in these response variables, however, vary greatly and depend upon the taxonomic groups protected, size and type of reserve, oceanographic regime, and time since the reserve was implemented. We conducted collaborative, fishery-independent surveys of fishes for seven years in and near newly created marine protected areas (MPAs) in central California, USA. Results showed that initially most MPAs contained more and larger fishes than associated reference sites, likely due to differences in habitat quality. The differences between MPAs and reference sites did not greatly change over the seven years of our study, indicating that reserve benefits will be slow to accumulate in California's temperate eastern boundary current. Fishes in an older reserve that has been closed to fishing since 1973, however, were significantly more abundant and larger than those in associated reference sites. This indicates that reserve benefits are likely to accrue in the California Current ecosystem, but that 20 years or more may be needed to detect significant changes in response variables that are due to MPA implementation. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of fish recruitment patterns, long-term monitoring is needed to identify positive responses of fishes to protection in the diverse set of habitats in a dynamic eastern boundary current. Qualitative estimates of response variables, such as would be obtained from an expert opinion process, are unlikely to provide an accurate description of MPA performance. Similarly, using one species or one MPA as an indicator is unlikely to provide sufficient resolution to accurately describe the performance of multiple MPAs.",31,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0118502,WOS:000351275000024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"meta-analysis approach, no value of interest"

Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found.

In this study, we assessed the assemblages of seven commercially important coral reef fish families (Acanthuridae (excluding genus Zebrasoma), Labridae (subfamily Scarinae only), Lutjanidae, Serranidae (subfamily Epinephelinae only), Mullidae, Haemulidae and Lethrinidae) inside and outside MPAs in 37 coastal municipalities in the Philippines. A total of 12,354 individuals belonging to 114 species (33 species of Acanthuridae, 27 species of Scarinae, 17 species of Lutjanidae, 16 species of Epinephelinae, 9 species of Mullidae, 6 species of Haemulidae, and 6 species of Lethrinidae) were recorded. Overall, reef fishes inside MPAs were more diverse than outside MPAs based on Shannon-Wiener index of diversity. Reefs inside MPAs had an average of four more fish species than outside MPAs.

We then asked whether MPAs favoured representation of phylogenetically and functionally more distinct species or whether there was a tendency to favour less distinctive ones. We finally evaluated the overall conservation effectiveness of the MPAs using a metric that integrates species' phylogenetic and functional relationships and targets achievement. The effectiveness of the MPA system at protecting biodiversity was assessed by comparison of its achievements against a null model obtained by siting current MPAs at random over the study area.ResultsAmong the coastal fish species analysed, 16 species were not covered by any MPA. All the remaining species only partially achieved the pre-defined representation target. The current MPA system missed fewer species than expected from siting MPAs at random. However, c.70% of the species did not achieve better protection in the current MPAs than expected from siting MPAs at random. Functional and evolutionary distinctiveness were weakly correlated with target achievement. The observed coverage of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity was not different or lower than expected from siting MPAs at random.Main conclusionsThe Mediterranean MPA system falls short in meeting conservation targets for coastal fish taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity.

BRUV methodology has, however, also varied greatly for a range of reasons. A major dichotomy occurs, in particular, in the time used to sample the fish assemblages i.e. the BRUV set time. The aim of this study was to determine whether differences in set time were likely to affect the conclusions reached by studies using different set times, and what might be the most appropriate and cost-effective set time to use to sample temperate reef fish assemblages. In this study, we test whether there were significant differences between the two main set times used (i.e. 30 and 60 min) in BRUV sampling for assemblage patterns, species diversity, and relative abundance of rocky reef fishes. In particular, we sampled fished and unfished rocky reefs to assess whether the different set times would lead to differences in the patterns or the interpretation of the subsequent data. We sampled fish assemblages on six rocky reefs (20-35 m) across two marine parks on the east coast of Australia. At each location replicate BRUVs were deployed for 30 and 60 min in a 'no take' area (marine sanctuary) and a fished area. The interpretations of the data across the fished and unfished zones were consistent with both set times indicating that the conclusions from both set time were comparable. Furthermore, there were no differences in fish assemblages or species richness between the set times. The relative abundances of the recreationally and commercially important snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) were greater in the longer set times, but the actual spatial patterns between zones and amongst locations were consistent. Piecewise regression analysis of the breakpoint times for species accumulation found that there were no significant differences between locations or between fished and unfished areas. Mean breakpoint, the time when species accumulation changes, occurred at 12 min +/- 1.04 S.E. for all sites combined whilst the shorter set time was found to be less costly and require less field and laboratory times. This study quantifies that either 30 or 60 min will provide a reasonable estimate of rocky reef fish diversity and relative abundance for comparative purposes, on these shallow rocky reefs.

Consequently, reserves have been implemented in an attempt to reduce the threat to freshwater biodiversity. However, few studies have evaluated how effective these protected areas (PA) are for the conservation of freshwater organisms. In the present study, we compared species richness, community composition and density of small-bodied fishes between lagoons within an eight-year-old reserve (i.e. protected lagoons) with those outside the reserve (i.e. unprotected lagoons) in a river-floodplain system that is exposed to seasonal flooding. The unprotected lagoons have been submitted to a light fishing pressure mainly targeting small-sized fishes for sale as baits. Our results showed no differences between the lagoons inside the reserve with those outside in any of the community properties measured. However, we registered an overall tendency of abundance reduction among the species used as baits in unprotected lagoons. Considering the high degree of oversight in the PA and the low fishing pressure among unprotected lagoons, it is possible that the positive effects promoted by the reserve on fish assemblages are being exported towards unprotected lagoons and thus offsetting a portion of the anthropogenic impacts. We conclude that the protection provided by the reserve is very efficient in river-floodplain systems, because not only it protects the biota inside the reserve but also act as a source of propagules to unprotected areas during the rainy season when all the aquatic subsystems are connected by the flood.",9,2014,10.1007/s10531-014-0773-8,WOS:000345090000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the studied area is a freshwater system

The aim of this study was to assess the observed changes in the fish population structure in the years following a fishing ban. The experiment took place in the Bamboung bolong, a small bay in the Sine Saloum estuary in Senegal, West Africa. The protection of this zone was undertaken with local fishermen support, and a formal MPA was created in 2004. The survey of the fish assemblages was initiated in 2003, the year before the fishing ban, and went on until 2007, with 12 sampling sites being monitored three times per year.In this paper, we describe and analyze the evolution of the fish assemblage during this five years' experimental period. Some changes have been highlighted on which the effect of the fishing ban was shown. After the fishing ban, an increase of total biomass and of maximal fish length has been registered. In the same time, the number of species has increased and the percentage of large and/or iconic species targeted by fishing has also increased. The community structure has been modified, with more small fish, more big fish (new large species and more large individuals in the original species) and fewer medium sized fish. The contribution of marine affinity species has increased in depend of the estuarine part of the assemblage. Finally, the trophic structure has been modified with an overall increase of the mean trophic level, resulting from an increase of the percentage of generalist or piscivorous predators and a sharp decrease of herbivorous and detritivorous low trophic level species. Marine predators which numbers and size were reduced by fisheries are again important components of the system. We argue that despite the intrinsic variability of the tropical estuarine environments, the introduction of a total ban on fishing in such estuarine zones can substantially improve the health status of the fish assemblage.

We used Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to survey fish assemblages of unconsolidated substrata at different depths, distances from shore, and across an along-shore spatial scale of 10 s of km (2 transects) to examine how well the HCS works for this dominant habitat. We used multivariate regression modelling to examine the importance of these, and other environmental factors (backscatter intensity, fine-scale bathymetric variation and rugosity), in structuring fish assemblages. There were significant differences in fish assemblages across depths, distance from shore, and over the medium spatial scale of the study: together, these factors generated the optimum model in multivariate regression. However, marginal tests suggested that backscatter intensity, which itself is a surrogate for sediment type and hardness, might also influence fish assemblages and needs further investigation. Species richness was significantly different across all factors: however, total MaxN only differed significantly between locations.

The consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functions and services depend on the level of functional redundancy - the number of species with similar ecological functional traits. Using field data on fish assemblages from 199 coral reef and lagoon sites from six islands, and on local fisheries from four islands in The Bahamas, we examined levels of functional diversity and redundancy within these assemblages and determined how fish biomass and local fisheries catches vary with local diversity. A majority of functional groups contain few species, suggesting that these assemblages have limited functional redundancy. Most also include species targeted by local fisheries, thus fishing has the potential to broadly impact food webs. Comparisons between a large marine reserve and fished reefs confirm that fishing significantly reduces functional redundancy and removes whole functional groups. Positive exponential relationships of fish biomass and fisheries catches with species and functional diversity highlight that even small declines in biodiversity may result in large reductions in secondary production and seafood provision. Taken together, these results indicate that Caribbean fish assemblages have low functional redundancy and high vulnerability of ecosystem functions and services to diversity loss, and that protection of multi-species assemblages is needed to maintain functions and services.

However, empirical evidence for a relationship between beta-diversity (spatial turnover in community structure) and temporal stability in community structure remains equivocal, despite important implications for theoretical ecology and conservation biology. Here, we report strong beta-diversity-stability relationships across a broad sample of fish taxa on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. These relationships were robust to random sampling error and spatial and environmental factors, such as latitude, reef size and isolation. While beta-diversity was positively associated with temporal stability at the community level, the relationship was negative for some taxa, for example surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), one of the most abundant reef fish families. This demonstrates that the beta-diversity-stability relationship should not be indiscriminately assumed for all taxa, but that a species' risk of extirpation in response to disturbance is likely to be taxon specific and trait based. By combining predictions of spatial and temporal turnover across the study area with observations in marine-protected areas, we conclude that protection alone does not necessarily confer temporal stability and that taxon-specific considerations will improve the outcome of conservation efforts.",35,2014,10.1098/rspb.2013.1993,WOS:000332382000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of MPA

To test these ideas we examine trends in species incidence, community and trophic structure of temperate reef fishes over an eight year period within the Fiordland no-take marine reserve network, at management zones subject to commercial fishing and at those closed to commercial exploitation but open to recreational fishers. We use information from extensive stratified subtidal surveys of the reef fish community and abundance of macroalgae, as well as oceanographic data collected in 2002, 2006 and 2010. Our analyses indicate a regional decline in species richness of exploited reef fish in areas open to fishing between 2002 and 2010. Following implementation of spatial management (2006-2010), richness of 'exploited' species increased within marine reserves, but remained unchanged in areas open to fishing. Further, analysis of differences in community structure in this time period (2006-2010) indicate that both 'exploited' and 'non-target' groups were more stable within marine reserves than were those within fished areas. Consequentially average trophic level of the community remained stable within marine reserves but declined sharply in areas open to fishing, indicating both declines in large omnivorous species and increases in forage fish within exploited regions. These analyses offer an important test of the direct and indirect effects of marine reserve networks on the dynamics of reef fish communities at the landscape scale.

The toxins (ciguatoxins) responsible for CFP are produced by dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus, which are endemic to tropical and sub-tropical areas. Ciguatoxins are lipophilic and bioaccumulate in marine food webs, typically reaching their highest concentrations in fish. Following a CFP event in 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) issued a ciguatera toxin alert that included fish harvested in the northern Gulf of Mexico in and near the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS). The East Flower Garden Bank (EFGB) and West Flower Garden Bank (WFGB) are characterized by thriving coral communities that support Gambierdiscus growth. This study was undertaken specifically to document the diversity of Gambierdiscus species present in the sanctuary that may be sources of ciguatoxins entering the food web. Samples collected from the FGBNMS over a three year period were screened using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. A diverse assemblage of Gambierdiscus species was distributed to depths of >45 m, a new depth record for Gambierdiscus. Gambierdiscus belizeanus, Gambierdiscus caribaeus, Gambierdiscus carolinianus, Gambierdiscus carpenteri and Gambierdiscus ribotype 2 were all found on both East and West FGB with Gambierdiscus ruetzleri also recorded from the WFGB. The most common species was G. carolinianus, originally identified from samples collected between 35 and 40 m off the coast of NC, USA. Our findings are consistent with recent physiological studies showing that some Gambierdiscus species can grow year round at the temperatures and salinities at the FGBNMS and at light levels as low as 10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Such irradiances are estimated to occur in the FGBNMS at depths of 7080 m. The consistent recovery of Gambierdiscus species from deep sampling sites in areas known to produce ciguatoxic fish signals a substantial change in our concept of suitable habitats for Gambierdiscus to include depths greater than 50 m.

We used heterogeneous reef seascapes as a model system to examine the potential interaction of reserves and mangrove-reef connectivity and compared the magnitude of these effects across the western Pacific Ocean.Location The tropical and subtropical western Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Australia.Methods We quantified fish densities on coral reefs (38 sites) and in mangrove forests (19 sites) across seven marine reserves and twelve unprotected control locations. Fish assemblages were in seascapes supporting either adjacent reefs and mangroves or isolated reefs. For each reserve-control comparison, we evaluated the potential interactive effects of habitat connectivity on species richness and densities of harvested species, functional groups, families and individual species. We then examined the influence of spatial variation in reserve attributes, seascape heterogeneity and latitude on the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects.Results Snappers (Lutjanidae) and rabbitfish (Siganidae) were more abundant on reserve reefs close to mangroves in all regions. These interactive effects also enhanced the abundance of sweetlip (Haemulidae), bream (Sparidae), harvested fish, herbivores and piscivores and species richness in two of the three regions examined. Spatial variation in the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects was explained by differences among reserves in seascape variables (i.e. area of mangroves and reef, duration of mangrove inundation and distance to rivers) but not by reserve attributes (i.e. age, size, poaching) or latitude.Main conclusions Habitat connectivity improved the effectiveness of reserves across the western Pacific Ocean.

These results were confirmed and exemplified by significant univariate differences between locations for total abundance, Species Richness and diversity of the fish assemblage; values of these metrics were higher inside the reserve than outside. Small fish size and species of low and medium fishing value did not display significant inside/outside differences in abundances whereas medium, large size fish and high value species showed abundances significantly higher inside the marine reserve. Protection effects were particularly evident for large specimens of high fishing value, most of which were exclusively found inside the reserve (Diplodus puntazzo, Epinephelus costae, Mycteroperca rubra, Scorpaena scrofa, Spondyliosoma can thaws, Sciaena umbra and Epinephelus marginatus).

We conducted a comparative ecosystem analysis of the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities to determine the extent to which biological diversity is restored when fishing pressure is reduced. First, fishing mortality estimates were combined to quantify the community-level intensity and selectivity of fishing pressure. Second, standardized bottom-trawl survey data were used to investigate the temporal trends in community metrics. Third, a size-based, multispecies model (LeMans) was simulated to test the response of community metrics to both hypothetical and observed changes in fishing pressure in the two communities. These temperate North Atlantic fish communities have much in common, including a history of overfishing. In recent decades fishing pressure has been reduced, and some species have started to rebuild. The Georges Bank fishery has been more selective, and fishing pressure was reduced sooner. The two communities have similar levels of size diversity and biomass per unit area, but fundamentally different community structure. The North Sea is dominated by smaller species and has lower evenness than Georges Bank. These fundamental differences in community structure are not explained by recent fishing patterns. The multispecies model was able to predict the observed changes in community metrics better on Georges Bank, where rebuilding is more apparent than in the North Sea. Model simulations predicted hysteresis in rebuilding community metrics toward their unfished levels, particularly in the North Sea. Species in the community rebuild at different rates, with smaller prey species outpacing their large predators and overshooting their pre-exploitation abundances. This indirect effect of predator release delays the rebuilding of community structure and biodiversity. Therefore community rebuilding is not just the sum of single-species rebuilding plans. Management strategies that account for interspecific interactions will be needed to restore biodiversity and community structure.",18,2013,10.1890/12-0877.1,WOS:000316559800010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of species richness or other usable biodiversity indicator

Y.; Thomson, Damian P.",Relative and combined effects of habitat and fishing on reef fish communities across a limited fishing gradient at Ningaloo,MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,,"Habitat degradation and fishing are major drivers of temporal and spatial changes in fish communities. The independent effects of these drivers are well documented, but the relative importance and interaction between fishing and habitat shifts is poorly understood, particularly in complex systems such as coral reefs. To assess the combined and relative effects of fishing and habitat we examined the composition of fish communities on patch reefs across a gradient of high to low structural complexity in fished and unfished areas of the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Biomass and species richness of fish were positively correlated with structural complexity of reefs and negatively related to macroalgal cover. Total abundance of fish was also positively related to structural complexity, however this relationship was stronger on fished reefs than those where fishing is prohibited. The interaction between habitat condition and fishing pressure is primarily due to the high abundance of small bodied planktivorous fish on fished reefs. However, the influence of management zones on the abundance and biomass of predators and target species is small, implying spatial differences in fishing pressure are low and unlikely to be driving this interaction. Our results emphasise the importance of habitat in structuring reef fish communities on coral reefs especially when gradients in fishing pressure are low. The influence of fishing effort on this relationship may however become more important as fishing pressure increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abundance estimates, frequency of observations, and species indicators (richness and diversity) provided the basis for comparison between methods. UVC recorded significantly greater numbers of species in all estuaries and significantly greater species richness and diversity at two of the three estuaries. Variation in the number and frequency of species detected by each method directly related to the ecological niche and behaviour of each species. UVC provided better estimates of the rare or cryptic reef associated species. BRUV sampled a smaller proportion of species overall but did observe key recreational species such as Acanthopagrus australis, Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba with increased frequency, although the presence of large numbers of schooling species such as Pelates sexlineatus reduced the detection frequency of these species. In summary, results indicate that BRUV is an effective method for recording species associated with artificial reefs with the exception of cryptic species that are located within the reef structure itself. BRUV techniques complement UVC by providing increased coverage of species known to be diver averse as well as providing important information regarding behaviour of the species identified. Given the limitation of each method, it is recommended that monitoring plans for artificial structures should adopt a multi-method approach utilising BRUV and UVC where possible.

Here, we elucidate the bias that can arise when applying a popular sampling method (i.e., fixed number of belt-transects) to census coral community richness when the size of the reef and the regional species pools vary. Based on surveys of 148 patch reefs in 3 sub-regions of the Western Atlantic, we show that a fixed sub-sampling approach underestimated coral species richness of the reef as reef size increased; though this bias is minor for the entire region. The percentage of the true reef richness captured by sub-sampled transects declined by 6% for every 10-fold change in reef size. However, in Belize, the most speciose sub-region sampled, coral richness was underestimated by 15% solely as a result of a 10-fold increase in reef size. Increasing sampling effort (nr of transects) per reef was not able to correct for this underestimation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this sampling bias is not an artifact of larger reefs simply being more diverse, and hence, requiring greater sampling efforts. Rather, these results suggest that coral species in diverse regions are distributed in accordance with the variety of spatially structured microhabitats present on a reef, rather than distributing randomly across the reef surface. Furthermore, these patterns seem to be highly scale-dependent. As such, sampling protocols should consider the size of the reef to be surveyed as well as the regional species pool to ensure accurate estimates of coral diversity.",1,2012,10.4319/lom.2012.10.110,WOS:000302919400001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of MPA

There were no detectable differences in the species richness or taxonomic distinctiveness before (1975-1983) and after (2003-2007) this period. However, there was a shift in the epifaunal assemblage between the surveys in 1975-1983 and 2003-2007. In general, the slow-moving, or sessile, erect, filter-feeders were replaced by highly mobile, swimming, scavengers and predators. There were declines in the frequency of the fished bivalve Aequipecten opercularis and the non-fished bivalves Modiolus modiolus and Chlamys varia and some erect sessile invertebrates between the surveys in 1975-1983 and 2003-2007.

We suggest that these shifts could be directly and indirectly attributed to the long-term impacts of trawl fishing gear, although increases in the supply of discarded bait and influxes of sediment may also have contributed to changes in the frequency of some taxa. These results suggest that despite their limitations, historical surveys and repeat sampling over long periods can help to elucidate the inferred patterns in the epifaunal community. The use of commercial fishing gear was banned from two areas in Strangford Lough in 2011, making it a model ecosystem for assessing the long-term recovery of the epifaunal community from the impacts of mobile and pot fishing gear.

These biocoenoses host a highly diverse assemblage of small sized species. The work has a high species resolution and takes into consideration the richest but also more taxonomically difficult size class (1-6 mm). DAs contain allochthonous species which mainly live in deeper soft substrates but also contain species which were under-represented in the LA samples because they are endolithic or cemented to hard substrates, although such species are numerically rare. Multivariate analysis shows there are significant differences between living and death assemblages within habitats, but also that DAs are able to discriminate the two types of habitat Fidelity of species richness and evenness is better in the coralligenous biocoenosis rather than in the P. oceanica meadow. This may be due to the reduced transport of shells out of the rhizome layer due to its reduced hydrodynamism due to the effect of the canopy. The good fidelity in the coralligenous biocoenosis suggests that the situation is close to complete ergodic mixing that draws individuals that coexisted or potentially coexisted in the same habitat into the DA The lower fidelity in the P. oceanica meadow suggests incomplete ergodic mixing which can occur when within-habitat spatial mixing does not result in homogenization of dead skeletal material because transportation is non-uniform. Marked differences in species abundance between the LA and the DA are observed in both habitats and the result is consistent with previous works in similar habitats. Among the factors influencing fidelity, we hypothesize that trophic guild and life span of species may influence species abundance because carnivores and scavengers are more abundant in the living assemblage while microalgae herbivores are more abundant in the death assemblage. This difference in the fidelity of guild abundance may be connected to the different life span of species because many herbivores have short life span while carnivores and scavengers have long life span, although this issue needs to be further tested. On the contrary, temporal changes in community composition and individual preservation rate are not considered to influence fidelity significantly. The study suggests low bottom transport of dead shells in these habitats. This work opens good prospects for biodiversity assessments on the basis of DAs because it allows reduced diving and field time and better faunistic description due to time-averaging. However, dead specimens tend to lose important diagnostic characters and may require more skilled personnel for sorting and identification. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Completely banning fishing from coral reefs is now accepted to have significant benefits for marine biodiversity and in many cases, fisheries. However, the benefits of regulating fishing on coral reefs, by restricting the methods used, or the total amount of fishing, are less well understood, even though such regulations are much more likely to be supported by fishermen.2. This study assesses whether banning illegal, destructive fishing methods and reducing the numbers of fishermen visiting from outside an area benefits a coral reef fishery, despite unregulated fishing by local fishermen using non-destructive methods.3. The abundance, biomass, mean length, and species richness of nine commercially important fish families are compared across ten independent patch reefs inside and outside the 470 km(2) Menai Bay Conservation Area in Zanzibar, Tanzania.4. Even after taking into account the effect of differences in habitat and the distance between reefs, 61% (+/- 19.7%) more fish species were found in regulated than unregulated reefs. Fish abundance, biomass, and length were not affected, suggesting that banning destructive fishing may improve biodiversity, but that further regulations may be required to improve fish stocks.

This study presents a comparison of the benthic cover and fish communities in three widely different management systems: (1) a heavily utilized subsistence fishery (yields > 5Mg km(-2) yr(-1)); (2) moderately sized and well enforced fisheries closures (similar to 9% of the nearshore area) surrounded by heavy fishing; and (3) a more lightly used management system (yields < 5Mg km(-2) yr(-1)).2. The objective was to compare management systems of small to moderate-sized closures surrounded by heavy use in Kenya with a large-scale light-use management system in the Maldives.3. Gross level attributes of the fish community suggest that the Maldives reefs had higher numbers of individuals (30%) and species (15%) than the Kenyan closures.4. Maldivian reefs had higher abundance of some carnivores such as emperors (Lethrinidae), jacks (Carangidae), triggerfish (Balistidae), and trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae). Half the biomass of fish in the Maldives was, however, composed of surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), which resulted in a higher abundance of herbivores/detritivores than found in Kenyan closures.5. Apex predator species were not a large portion of the biomass (< 10%) in any system and, if remote reefs of the Pacific are examples of undisturbed ecosystems, then neither management system has fully protected apex species.

We studied fish community composition in Playa Blanca Marine Reserve (9 degrees 40' N - 84 degrees 40' W), a rocky shore site on the central Pacific coast of Costa Rica. We conducted visual surveys of fishes along six strip transects soon after the area was designated a marine reserve in 1995. then again in 2006 following an eleven-year period of complete protection. We recorded a total of 31 406 sightings of 72 species from 30 families. Pomacentrids (42.5%). labrids (16.6%) and haemulids (14.8%) dominated the community, accounting for >70% of total fish abundance. In comparison to other sites in the region, the fish community was more similar to one reported from B thia Honda, Panama (7 degrees 50' N - 81 degrees 35 W) than from the geographically more proximate Culebra Bay, Costa Pica (10 degrees 45' N - 8543 W). Sixty-one species from 26 families were recorded in 1995; sixty-nine species from 28 families in 2006. Our results suggest that the Playa Blanca Marine Reserve is fulfilling its conservation role. Average fish abundance, species richness and Shannon's index of community diversity were greater in 2006 than 1995, and fish community composition varied significantly within each transect among years. Much of tie change in community composition among years resulted from spatial and temporal variation in the abundarce of a few dominant species, including Abudefduf troschelli.

No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are much advocated as a means of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure from overharvest. In contrast to terrestrial protected areas, NTMRs are not only expected to conserve or recover biodiversity and ecosystems within their boundaries, but also to enhance biodiversity beyond their boundaries by exporting species richness and more complex biological communities. Here we show that species richness of large predatory reef fish increased fourfold and 11-fold inside two Philippine no-take marine reserves over 14 and 25 years, respectively. Outside one reserve (Apo) the species richness also increased. This increase beyond the Apo reserve boundary was 78% higher closer to the boundary (200-250 m) than farther from it (250-500 m). The increase in richness beyond the boundary could not be explained by improvements over time in habitat or prey availability. Furthermore, community composition of predatory fish outside but close to (200-250 m) the Apo reserve became very similar to that inside the reserve over time, almost converging with it in multivariate space after 26 years of reserve protection. This is consistent with the suggestion that, as community composition inside Apo reserve increased in complexity, this complexity spilled over the boundary into nearby fished areas. Clearly, the spillover of species richness and community complexity is a direct consequence of the spillover of abundance of multiple species. However, this spillover of species richness and community complexity demonstrates an important benefit of biodiversity and ecosystem export from reserves, and it provides hope that reserves can help to reverse the decline of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.",103,2011,10.1890/09-1197.1,WOS:000288850200020,field,BACI,2008,MPA,Apo,23,old,1985,FPA,fully,0.23,0.23,small,yes,Philippines,tropical,Asia,South China Sea,coral reef,,ecological,fish,,,,,,,biodiversity,,species richness,Results,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no error associated with the values

Ordination (nMDS) disclosed the existence of five clusters of stations related to degree of exposure. Relatively sheltered stations were dominated by two endemic species of deposit-feeding microgastropod, and they supported significantly higher macrobenthic densities but lower species diversity and less evenness than relatively exposed stations. The latter were dominated by polychaetes and also possessed more suspension feeders, equivalent to more open seagrass beds in other latitudes. Species richness per station, however, was relatively constant across the whole basin.3. The smaller benthic macrofauna, totalling 82 species, was found to include several animals (< 5 mm) hitherto unknown from the region, including one gastropod genus (Cornirostra) not previously known from Africa.4. Species were patchily distributed across all scales from 1 m to > 1 km, but variance partitioning showed components of total variance to decrease with increasing spatial scale: sample (46.5%), station (30.0%), site (23.5%).5. These findings are discussed in relation to conservation site selection in rich but faunistically heterogeneous seagrass beds that are impacted by bait collection or other human disturbance.

Although the structure of coral reef fish assemblages is strongly correlated with attributes of reef structure, data relating reef types to fish assemblages are scarce. In this study we describe the influence of gross habitat characteristics and seasonality on coral reef fish assemblages of fringing and patch reefs in Kenya. Results showed that total fish abundance was not significantly different between the reefs; however, the fringing reef had higher species diversity during both the northeast (42 spp.) and southeast (36 spp.) monsoon seasons when compared to the patch reef. The more fished species (e.g. Siganus sutor and Lethrinus mahsena) were more abundant on the patch reef in both seasons. Statistical analysis indicated common species between the reefs were more abundant on the fringing reef. Seasons affected abundance of the more vagile species (S. sutor), whereas the reef-attached sky emperor, L. mahsena was affected more by reef type than by seasons. No significant interaction effects of habitat and seasons were found, indicating independence of habitat and environmental variability in affecting fish assemblages on the reefs. Smaller sized fish dominated the fringing reef more than the patch reef, whereas the skewness index (Sk) indicated a normal-sized frequency distribution on the patch reef. Trophic structure of the fishes varied more within than between reefs, whereas fish assemblage structure was affected more by seasons on the fringing reef. These results suggest that conservation measures such as marine protected area (MPA) design and setting should consider effects of reef morphology and environmental variability on coral-reef fish assemblage structure.",3,2010,10.1111/j.1439-0485.2010.00363.x,WOS:000280671300010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Unfortunately, these reefs have been recently subjected to local and regional disturbances. The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are potentially non-random processes forcing the observed coral diversity patterns, and highlight where and at which spatial scales these processes might be most influential.Methodology/Principal Findings: A hierarchical (nested) sampling design was employed across three spatial scales, ranging from transects (<= 20 m), stations (<100 m), to sites (<1000 m), to examine coral diversity patterns. Two of the four sites, Chumbe and Mnemba, were located within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), while the other two sites, Changuu and Bawe, were not protected. Additive partitioning of coral diversity was used to separate regional (total) diversity (gamma) into local alpha diversity and among-sample beta diversity components. Individual-based null models were used to identify deviations from random distribution across the three spatial scales. We found that Chumbe and Mnemba had similar diversity components to those predicted by the null models. However, the diversity at Changuu and Bawe was lower than expected at all three spatial scales tested. Consequently, the relative contribution of the among-site diversity component was significantly greater than expected. Applying partitioning analysis for each site separately revealed that the within-transect diversity component in Changuu was significantly lower than the null expectation.Conclusions/Significance: The non-random outcome of the partitioning analyses helped to identify the among-sites scale (i.e., 10's of kilometers) and the within-transects scale (i.e., a few meters; especially at Changuu) as spatial boundaries within which to examine the processes that may interact and disproportionately differentiate coral diversity.

Zoological Studies 49(2): 195-210. The aim of this work was to compare coral reef fish communities from a small recently established marine reserve (a no-take area, NTA) with 3 nearby fishing areas within Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan. Two depth zones (shallow at 3-4 m and deep at 8-10 m) of fringing coral reefs were surveyed at each of the 4 study sites. One of the sites was located within a small NTA (1.5 km(2)) established in 2005 in the western part of Nanwan Bay. Quantitative data on the composition, abundance, and size of fishes and macroinvertebrates were collected by a visual census using 20 x 5 m belt transects (4 transects per depth zone). The coverage of corals, algae, and substratum was estimated using the photoquadrat technique (40 quadrats of 1 m(2) per depth zone). This will serve as the baseline survey within the marine reserve after it was established. Fish species richness and diversity as well as the abundances of 3 fish families and 2 trophic groups were significantly higher in the NTA than in the 3 other sites in which fishing is allowed. Significant differences in the abundances and sizes of fishes belonging to the Lutjanidae suggest that this family can be used as an indicator to reflect impacts of conservation efforts in the reserve. However, results of multiple regression and correlation analyses suggested that differences in certain reef fish families, especially the Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae, are attributable to the habitat type and structural complexity of the reefs rather than to conservation efforts alone. This study demonstrates that there is the potential for profound changes toward recovery of fish stocks within small marine reserves over a short time frame. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.2/195.pdf",5,2010,,WOS:000276575900005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

In the present study we document changes in intertidal sandflat ecosystems over the last 5 decades in Langebaan Lagoon, a marine reserve on the west coast of South Africa, following large-scale losses of seagrass Zostera capensis. Aerial photography and GIS revealed a 38% loss of seagrass at sites in Langebaan Lagoon between 1960 and 2007. Longterm monitoring of one particular site, Klein Oesterwal, indicated a major shift in invertebrate communities between 1983, when Z. capensis was abundant, and 2009, when Z. capensis had virtually disappeared. Abundance and species richness of invertebrates declined significantly over this period. Seagrass-associated species such as the limpets Siphonaria compressa and Fissurella mutabilis, and the starfish Parvulastra exigua, declined almost to extinction locally. Generalists such as the gastropod Assiminea globulus also declined in abundance. However, sandflat species, particularly burrowers, increased in abundance and vertical range. Wading birds also appeared to be affected by changes in seagrass cover. The terek sandpiper, which depends on Z. capensis for feeding, showed 3 local population crashes, each corresponding to periods of seagrass collapse. Abundance of wading birds that were not dependant on this seagrass was more stable. The loss of seagrasses in the system, together with anthropogenic disturbance such as bait harvesting and trampling, may have had severe impacts on invertebrates, the most significant being the virtual extinction locally of the critically endangered limpet S. compressa. Cascading effects on wading birds, possibly through changes in availability of invertebrate prey, were also evident.",41,2010,10.3354/meps08733,WOS:000283764600004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

In this study, a depth-stratified survey of benthic community structure and coral species assemblages was conducted at 9 sites around the Kermadec Islands. All coral species identified were subtropical non-reef building species, or species with a wide geographic range. Scleractinian coral cover (16 species) was low and variable between sites and depths (5.3 +/- 13.9 %, mean +/- SD) with macroalgae contributing between 36 to 95 % of the benthic cover, Multivariate analyses revealed small-scale spatial variability between closely located sites. Resulting data on coral species diversity were compared to published data from coral communities at other 'marginal' locations, as well as those from a range of Australian locations. On a global scale, the Kermadec Islands coral community exhibits greatest affinity with southeastern Australian sites. In comparison, there was a lack of affinity for Australian tropical sites and other high latitude sites, both in Australia and globally.

Sponges are major contributors to benthic community structure on temperate reefs and although several studies have investigated how abiotic processes control sponge distributions on these reefs. the role of predation is less clear. We investigated the relationship between sponge predators and the distribution of sponges on temperate reefs in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), off Georgia, USA. We documented sponge species richness and abundance, spongivorous fish density, and examined the ability of 19 sponge species to chemically and structurally deter predation by fishes. We also conducted reciprocal transplant experiments to determine if predation by fishes contributes to the observed zonation of sponge species on these reefs. Our surveys revealed two distinct sponge assemblages: one characterized by amorphous and encrusting sponge morphotypes colonizing the vertical, rocky outcroppings (scarp sponge community), while the other consisted of pedunculate, digitate, and arborescent growth forms occurring on the sediment-laden reef top (plateau sponge community). Spongivorous fishes were more abundant on the scarp than the plateau and scarp sponges were found to be more effective than plateau sponges at chemically deterring generalist fishes. In contrast, plateau sponges were more reliant on structural defenses: a result consistent with the higher spicule content of their skeletons. Transplant experiments confirmed that predators prevent some plateau sponges from colonizing the scarp even though they possess structural defenses. Thus, predation appears to play a role in shaping sponge community structure on SAB reefs by restricting those species lacking adequate chemical defenses to habitats where there is a paucity of spongivores.

Diseases are now recognized as a major cause of mortality in reef-forming corals and are complicit in phase shifts of reef ecosystems to algal-dominated states worldwide. Even so, factors contributing to disease occurrence, spread, and impact remain poorly understood. Ecosystem resilience has been linked to the conservation of functional diversity, whereas overfishing reduces functional diversity through cascading, top-down effects. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that reefs with trophically diverse reef fish communities have less coral disease than overfished reefs. We surveyed reefs across the central Philippines, including well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs), and found that disease prevalence was significantly negatively correlated with fish taxonomic diversity. Further, MPAs had significantly higher fish diversity and less disease than unprotected areas. We subsequently investigated potential links between coral disease and the trophic components of fish diversity, finding that only the density of coral-feeding chaetodontid butterflyfishes, seldom targeted by fishers, was positively associated with disease prevalence. These previously uncharacterized results are supported by a second large-scale dataset from the Great Barrier Reef.

The lack of information about marine biodiversity is problematic for the selection of conservation reserves that aim to protect representative samples of biodiversity. A number of surrogate measures for biodiversity have been suggested as a potential solution to this problem.2. The present study tested the effectiveness of using higher taxa of macroinvertebrates as a surrogate for species-level identification to depict spatial variation in species richness and assemblage variation and to select conservation reserves in one estuary in south-east Australia.3. Spatial patterns of richness and assemblage variation for species were significantly correlated with patterns defined from genera, families, orders, classes, and phyla with a decline in the magnitude of correlation coefficients from finer to coarser resolutions. A network of reserves selected to include representatives of all phyla, classes, orders, families and genera coincidentally included 54%, 61.7%, 75%, 92.6%, 98.8% species in 8.3%, 13.9%, 17.7%, 44.4% and 58.3% of grid cells, respectively. However, only reserves selected for genera, families and orders performed significantly better than random selection.4. Percentage of species represented by orders, families and genera in a realistic level of available grid cells for conservation (i.e. 13.9%) were very close ranging between 70 and 73.5%. A factor diminishing the performance of order as surrogate for species richness was related to the difficulty of identifying many macroinvertebrates to the order level. Therefore, it is concluded that genus- and family-level identification is an effective surrogate for species-level identification for conservation planning in estuaries.

However, this may not always be possible. Ecosystem-based management is frequently suggested as a way to achieve multiple objectives in resource management and requires that trade-offs among conflicting objectives be identified and an effective means to utilize these trade-offs developed.We examine the relationship between area and species richness in a diverse assemblage of fishes along the US West Coast and then use parameters from this relationship as input for a model that considers trade-offs between fisheries yield and the number of species protected by different management strategies.The species-area relationship (S = cA(z)) for fishes along the US Pacific coast is well described by the relationship S = 16 center dot 18A(0 center dot 226).There are nearly linear trade-offs between diversity and yield when fishing effort is low. However, the trade-offs become nonlinear as fishing effort increases and imposing MPAs increases both the conservation and fisheries value of the system when the system is overfished.Synthesis and applications. Solving conflicts between fisheries and conservation requires attention as to how conservation benefits accrue as fishing effort is reduced.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected to function Simultaneously as biological conservation and fisheries management tools, but empirical evidence linking biodiversity conservation with fisheries benefits is scarce. Around the Medes Islands marine reserve (Spain, NW Mediterranean) patterns of fish catch diversity, catch (CPUE) and income (IPUE) were assessed and the economic value of diversity for local fisheries was explored by combining a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with geostatistics.2. Catch data were derived from the trammel net fleet operating around the MPA to gain information on species diversity, functional diversity, functional redundancy, CPUE and IPUE.3. Results revealed significant impact of both the fishing prohibition in the MPA and the presence of seagrass beds on diversity metrics, catch and income. Clear differences in functional redundancy in fish assemblages were found within the study area, indicating greater resilience of the fish assemblage against fishing pressure or human impact close to the MPA (<= 2 km). In contrast, fish assemblages beyond 2 km of the MPA border are more vulnerable to disturbance. High values of diversity, CPUE and IPUE overlapped close to the MPA border and close to seagrass beds.4. The spatial approach developed suggests that, in addition to the more commonly studied effect of density-dependent spillover of adult fish, increased levels of ecological diversity and economic diversity can also result in fisheries benefits of an MPA. Hence, the fishing regulations in and around the Medes Islands marine reserve have shown that biological conservation and fisheries benefits can be complementary in the long-term, which should be considered in future policies for MPAs or MPA networks.

H.","Connectivity, biodiversity conservation and the design of marine reserve networks for coral reefs",CORAL REEFS,,"Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This representation objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.",231,2009,10.1007/s00338-009-0484-x,WOS:000265832100004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of species richness or other usable biodiversity indicator

Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response.

Commercial species richness was depleted by 15.1% at shallow depths in fished reefs, but there was no difference between the reefs deeper than seven metres. Non-commercial species were not affected by fishing or depth. Evidence for similar patterns in fish communities in other countries and depth-limitations to artisanal fishing methods imply this effect is widespread.

Sampling was done at three sites, each of which included 4 habitat types: the external and the internal portions of caves, and shallow and deep rocky cliffs. 10 and 13 species were found exclusively inside cave habitats (e.g. Corcyrogobius lichtensteini, Thorogobius ephippiatus and Grammonus ater) or in rocky cliffs (e.g. Diplodus annularis, Sarpa salpa, Sparisoma cretense, Spondyliosoma cantharus), respectively. The four habitat types shared 10 species, and the external portions of the caves shared the most species (both with the internal cave portions and the external rocky cliffs). As a general rule, dissimilarity in the fish assemblage structure between habitats was far greater than dissimilarity between sites. Apogon imberbis (mostly associated with caves) and Chromis chromis (typifying rocky cliffs, mainly the deep ones) mostly contributed to dissimilarities between caves and rocky cliffs. Apogon imberbis (mostly associated with internal caves) and Coris julis (mainly associated to external cave portions) contributed strongly to dissimilarities between internal and external cave portions, while C chromis, Symphodus mediterraneus and C julis (associated with the deeper cliffs) and Thalassoma pavo (mostly present in shallow cliffs) differentiated deep and shallow cliffs. Diplodus vulgaris, Oblada melanura and Mullus surmuletus showed a marked increase in density during the cold season in the caves. These results show that fish assemblages associated with rocky reefs rich in marine caves (in terms of relative densities, species composition, species richness, exclusive species and presence of juveniles of some valuable species) may be affected by the peculiar ecological conditions within caves, which could provide additional resources for fishes (e.g. food availability, refuge against predators, sand patches within a rocky matrix) compared to rocky reefs without caves. These results suggest that stretches of rocky coasts rich in marine caves should be considered within management/conservation programs (e.g. when establishing Marine Protected Areas).

Distributional patterns in infauna were further examined in relation to epifaunal species composition and environmental conditions to investigate structural forcing. Grab samples of infauna were collected from the same 65 sites sampled in an earlier survey of epifauna. In total, 240 taxa belonging to 11 phyla were collected. Most taxa were uncommon, with 96% representing less than 2% of the total number of individuals collected and 39% occurring at only one site. Unlike the epifauna, the infauna of the eastern GAB does not appear to be particularly diverse. Sessile filter feeders dominated the infaunal communities of the inner shelf, whereas motile, deposit-feeding organisms dominated the shelf break. As was the case with the epifauna, the highest numbers of taxa and individuals were recorded near the head of the bight and in inner-shelf waters off the western Eyre Peninsula, where productivity is enhanced by upwelling. Cluster analysis identified three community groupings, which were strongly correlated with depth.

Nha Trang Bay MPA is relatively rich in reef fishes compared to other areas in Vietnam and the Pacific Ocean outside the 'Coral Triangle,' consistent with its biogeographic location in the western South China Sea. A total of 266 species of 40 families of coral reef fishes formed five distinct assemblages. Spatial variations in distribution and structure of the assemblages were associated with eight significant biological and physical variables which were cover of living hard corals, encrusting corals, branching corals, Acropora, Millepora, Montipora, depth and distance from the coast of the mainland. The six factors in front are likely related to provision of shelter and nutrition, while the distance factor is likely to represent a gradient in disturbance and impacts from various mainland sources including sedimentation and pollution discharge from nearby rivers. Local species richness ranged from 35 to 70 species 500 m(-2) (mean: 51 +/- 2 SE) for reef flat stations and from 23 to 68 species 500 m(-2) (mean: 48 +/- 4 SE) for reef slope stations. Total species richness at each site averaged 76 species (+/- 4 SE), ranging from 56 to 110 species, dominated by wrasses, damselfishes, butterflyfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, groupers and goatfishes. Density of total fishes at each station ranged from 348 to 1,444 individuals 500 m(-2) (mean: 722 +/- 302 SE) for the reef flat stations and from 252 to 929 individuals 500 m(-2) (mean: 536 +/- 215.7 SE) for the reef slope stations.

Of the families included in the census, densities were dominated throughout the MPA by damselfishes and wrasses. Many target species, particularly groupers, snappers and emperors, were rare or absent and the low abundance of big fishes was consistent with over-harvesting.

We used a 5-year dataset (1996-2000) of macroalgal and sponge cover and water quality measurements as predictor variables of hard coral community structure in the FKNMS. The 16 water quality variables were summarized into 4 groups by principal component analysis (PCA). Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the principal component scores of water quality variables separated the reef sites into two main groups (and five sub-groups), referred to as reefs of similar influence (RSI). The main groups corresponded with their geographical locations within the Florida Keys: the reefs in the Upper and Middle Keys being homogeneous and collectively, having lower water quality scores relative to reefs in the Lower Keys. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between hard coral cover and key predictor variables (i.e., water quality, macroalgal cover and sponge cover) also separated the reefs in the Lower Keys from reefs in the Upper-Middle Keys, consistent with results of the cluster analysis, which categorized reefs based on RSI. These results suggest that the prevailing gradient of predictor variables may have influenced the structuring of coral reef communities at a spatial scale larger than the individual reef. Furthermore, it is conceivable that these predictor variables exerted influence for a long time rather than being a recent event. Results also revealed a pattern showing reduction in hard coral cover and species richness, and subsequent proliferation of macroalgae and sponges during the study period.

While the rate and extent of increase in coral cover (from <15 to >60%) was similar in the 2 sectors, differences in the rugosity of the underlying reef framework influenced the structure of fish communities. Soon after disturbance, when coral cover was very low and the limestone reef framework constituted most of the surface relief, the relatively featureless substrate on reefs of the southern sector supported fewer fish species than reefs of the northern sector, which had a more rugose substrate. At first, northern reefs also had a higher proportion of herbivorous fish species, presumably because the more complex reef surface provided shelter and allowed them to exploit the abundant algal turf. With increasing coral cover, coral colonies came to provide most of the surface relief in both sectors, and species richness and the trophic structure of the fish communities converged. Variation in the cover of branching corals explained significant variation in the fish communities in both sectors over time, reflecting the importance of this growth form to small coral-associated fishes. These results show that the recovery of the coral community and the complexity of underlying reef framework interact to determine the functional structure of associated fish communities despite differences in regional settings.",70,2008,10.3354/meps07657,WOS:000261797800016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of MPA

Yet, the paucity of spatial data for most coral reef taxa often requires conservation planners to design reserve systems based only on a subset of taxonomic groups as surrogates for all other taxa. In terrestrial systems the validity of surrogates for reserve design is established by testing for cross-taxon congruence (similarities in spatial patterns of species richness), but this concept has rarely been examined in the marine environment. We tested the suitability of taxa as conservation representation surrogates of coral reef species richness across the Indo-Pacific, based on species lists of fishes, corals, and mollusks from 167 sites. First, we tested the relevance of cross-taxon congruence patterns to predict these surrogacy patterns. We determined congruence between taxonomic groups by conducting a correlation analysis of dissimilarity values between pairs of sites. We then evaluated how well each taxonomic group represented the other groups in a marine reserve system selected by a greedy reserve-selection algorithm relative to reserve systems selected by chance. No taxonomic group we examined was a reliable surrogate for the other groups such that site selection based on that group always represented other taxa significantly better than random selection of sites. Sites selected based on hard corals represented the other taxonomic groups in a reserve system worse than randomly selected sites. Although we found high cross-taxon congruence between fishes and corals and between corals and mollusks, for some regions cross-taxon congruence was not always a reliable indicator of the ability of one taxonomic group to efficiently represent another in a reserve system.

Species richness recovered rapidly to an asymptote at 10 years. The two main herbivorous families displayed differing responses to protection, scarids recovering rapidly, but then exhibiting some decline while acanthurids recovered more slowly and steadily throughout the study. Recovery of the two invertebrate-eating groups suggested competitive interactions over resources, with the labrids recovering more rapidly before a decline and the balistids demonstrating a slower logistic recovery. Remaining families displayed differing trends with time, with a general pattern of decline in smaller size classes or small-bodied species after an initial recovery, which suggests that some species- and size-related competitive and predatory control occurs in older closures. There appears to be an ecological succession of dominance with an initial rapid rise in labrids and scarids, followed by a slower rise in balistids and acanthurids, an associated decline in sea urchins, and an ultimate dominance in calcifying algae.

The first task of this study, conducted along the shallow rocky reefs of Ustica, was to determine the species composition, diversity and relative density of the resident cryptobenthic fishes. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the effects of some macro- and microscale habitat characteristics on the distribution pattern of fishes. In particular, the effect of predator density was indirectly evaluated by comparing density data collected within and outside the integral reserve zone. Overall, 20 species belonging to Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Tripterygiidae, Scorpaenidae and Gobiesocidae were recorded. Gobius bucchichi, Scorpaena maderensis, Tripterygion delaisi, T. melanurus and T. tripteronotus were the numerically dominant and most common species. The effects of zone (i.e. of predator density), bottom type and depth on species richness, diversity and evenness were not significant. A greater total fish density was observed on stones compared with rocky cliff and plateau, but only in the shallowest depth range. At level of single species, G. bucchichi was more abundant inside than outside the integral reserve, but only on stones and at 0-2 m depth range. Density of G. bucchichi was generally higher on stones than on rocky cliffs or plateau and between 0 and 5 m depth, although these differences were not always significant. T. delaisi was conversely more abundant in the deepest stratum (7-10 m). Canonical analyses demonstrated that bottom type and depth influenced significantly the fish assemblage structure. The observed differences in the assemblage structure relied mainly upon the dominant species. T. tripteronotus was mainly associated with rocky plateau and the intermediate depth range (3-5 m), whereas S. maderensis, T. melanurus and Lipophrys trigloides inhabited preferentially the rocky cliffs. At microscale level, the habitat choice of the investigated species was almost entirely based on whether the substrate was either vegetated or composed of bare rock. T. delaisi and T. tripteronotus were associated with substrata covered by algae, whilst G. bucchichi, S. maderensis and T. melanurus preferred bare rock bottoms. In some species, the electivity indices for the less abundant type of cover, measured at different spatial scale, changed accordingly.

This is particularly significant when the structures are situated in a wide soft-bottom continental shelf. The presence of limestone structures, fossil reefs and pinnacles dating from circa 8 to 9 ka, to the north of the Paria Peninsula in north-eastern Venezuela, has been known to local fishermen for decades. Using echograms obtained during acoustic fisheries evaluations and the scarce previously available information, an improved location map of hard-bottom structures was made. Benthic samples to study macromolluscs were taken at depths between 54 and 93 m using an unmodified 2-m beam trawl. Four trawl samples were located over fossil reef areas while another four were situated in soft-bottom valleys between limestone structures. Fossil reefs in the area showed a highly patchy distribution. A total of 91 species from 43 Bivalvia, Gastropoda and Scaphopoda families were found, Gastropoda being the dominant class with 49 species. Paleo-reef-covered areas showed higher species richness and only 21% of the species found were common to both substrates. Gastropods Tonna maculosa and Polystira albida were the most abundant species and occurred in both substrate types. Bivalve life habits, a mixture of organism-substrate relationships, shell fixation, mobility and feeding type, differed significantly according to bottom type. Six species are recorded for the first time for eastern Venezuelan waters. Bottom heterogeneity plays an important role in marine ecosystems, providing shelter to fish populations and may be significant as breeding and nursery areas. Its presence in a region with biogeographical interest, situated in the confluence of three major provinces and with oceanographic conditions varying seasonally from upwelling dominated to Orinoco River discharges, makes this the area of interest and it should be evaluated as a possible Marine Protected Area.

Patterns of species composition are used to assess the effectiveness of the Benthic Protection Zone (BPZ) of the GAB Marine Park in representing regional biodiversity. A total of 753 kg of benthos belonging to 797 species and 10 phyla were collected in 65 5-min tows using a 1.8 m wide and 0.6 m high epibenthic sled, fitted with a 50 mm mesh bag. Results suggest that the eastern GAB supports one of the world's most diverse soft-sediment ecosystems. Sessile, suspension-feeding organisms (primarily poriferans, ascidians and bryozoans) dominated samples, and collectively comprised over 96% of the biomass and 74% of the species collected. Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between species richness and biomass and highlighted a general decline in both parameters with increasing depth and percentage mud in sediments. Six epifaunal assemblages identified in this study were correlated with depth and sediment type. Large total biomasses and high numbers of species were recorded in inner shelf waters of the western Eyre Peninsula, which support high levels of plankton production, and at the Head of the Bight, where sediments are fine grained. All six of the assemblages and 54% of the species collected were found in the BPZ, suggesting that the zone may effectively represent the epifaunal assemblages of the continental shelf in the eastern GAB.

Nevertheless, it is important to conserve genetic diversity since it provides the raw material for the maintenance of species diversity over longer, evolutionary time-scales and may also confer the basis for adaptation to environmental change. Many current marine reserves are small in size and isolated to some degree (e.g. sea loughs and offshore islands). While such features enable easier management, they may have important implications for the genetic structure of protected populations, the ability of populations to recover from local catastrophes and the potential for marine reserves to act as sources of propagules for surrounding areas. Here, we present a case study demonstrating genetic differentiation, isolation, inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity in populations of the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus in Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve (an isolated sea lough in southern Ireland), compared with populations on the local adjacent open coast and populations in England, Wales and France.

Reef fish communities modifications within the MPAs are now well known but their interactions with unprotected areas still needs to be quantified. Prior to the study of reef fish movement patterns between MPAs and unprotected reefs, the present study was planed to compare the coral reef fish communities of two fished reefs (Crouy and Laregnere reefs) and one protected reef (Laregnere islet) within the Park. Twelve stations were sampled on each reef using underwater visual census techniques. Three point counts were completed at each station; one on the reef flat, one on the upper part of the reef slope and one on the lower part of the reef slope. Species richness, density and biomass of all edible species in the Pacific and of commercial species in New Caledonia were calculated. No significant difference occurred between reefs for edible fish and all three indices. Significant differences occurred for the commercial species, with higher values on the protected reef for all three indices. Species richness was 15% and 28% higher, density 65% and 107% higher and biomass 94% and 158% higher in the reserve than in the unprotected reefs. Significant differences occurred for the most valuable commercial families; Serranids, Siganids, commercial Acanthurids and commercial Labrids, which were also more important in the protected reef.

Three species assemblages were identified using a Correspondence Analysis: one assemblage affected by cyclone Erica, one protected assemblage and one unprotected assemblage. A comparison with the results of a Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that these assemblages were primarily related to reef status and secondarily to substrate characteristics. Protection measures were responsible for a modification of reef fish organisation despite a significant effect of habitat structure. The density of commercial species in fished areas near the protected area was higher than in the reserve before the protection was effective.

These areas were Closed Area I (CAI), located on the western portion of the bank., and Closed Area II (CAII), on the eastern portion. After about 5 years of closure, the southern portion of CAII and the central portion of CAI, having exhibited substantial increases in biomass and density of sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus, were reopened to scallop fishing. Before the industry was allowed entry, we conducted surveys to monitor the recovery of benthic habitat and fauna inside both areas. Sampling sites were selected in a paired station design for an inside-outside comparison representative of major habitat types in each closed area; other stations were chosen to survey the remainder of the closed areas. At each station, we examined a suite of biotic and abiotic variables ranging from substrate type to benthos to nekton. Our results suggest few differences between the inside-outside paired stations in both closed areas for nekton and benthic species composition and species richness. Fish abundance and biomass were similar inside and outside the closed areas. However, individuals of species such as skates (Raja spp.), haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and flounders (Pleuronectiformes) were generally larger inside than outside the closed areas. Additionally, habitat type was important in determining the distribution, abundance, biomass, size, and feeding ecology for some of the more benthic-oriented species studied. In CAI, the differences we observed in the suite of biotic metrics are likely a result of the high diversity of habitat types, with many of the habitat types composed of higher-relief material (e.g., cobble, gravel, etc.) in the region. The seabed in the southern portion of CAII is a relatively high-energy sand habitat of low to moderate complexity and has a relatively low vulnerability to trawling and dredging, which may explain why there were less pronounced differences in abundance or biomass across habitat types in that closed area as compared to CAI. Other parts of closed areas on the northeastern shelf may exhibit more obvious changes in the same biological metrics due to the presence of more complex habitats and increased vulnerability to bottom tending fishing gear. Those differences we observed for CAI and CAII may have implications for the population dynamics of commercially valuable benthic species, yet that question remains a major challenge.",17,2005,,WOS:000232152900027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,control areas were previously closed to fishing

The impacts of trawls and dredges on marine benthic habitats and communities have been studied extensively, but mostly at small scales and over short time periods. To investigate the large-scale chronic impacts of towed fishing gears, zoned commercial fishery management systems allow comparison of habitats and communities between areas of seabed subjected to varying levels of towed-gear use.2. The Inshore Potting Agreement (IPA) was implemented in 1978 to restrict the use of towed gears in inshore areas that had traditionally been used by static-gear (pot and net) fishers. We used scallop dredges to sample benthic communities at sites within and adjacent to the IPA area that had been subjected to four different commercial fishing regimes since the inception of the system. These were: (i) towed gears only, (ii) annual, seasonal towed-gear use, (iii) temporary towed-gear use but reverting to static-gear use 18-24 months prior to sampling, and (iv) static gears only.3. There were no significant differences in the total species richness or biomass of benthic communities between sites under regimes (i) and (ii). There was significantly greater total species richness and biomass of benthic communities at sites under regimes (iii) and (iv) than at sites under regimes (i) and (ii). The benthic community biomass under regime (iv) was significantly greater than under all other regimes.4. The IPA has maintained benthic species that are important for the settlement and survival of others. The cessation of towed-gear fishing for a period of greater than 2 years would be necessary for benthic communities in areas adjacent to the IPA to recover such that they were indistinguishable from areas where towed gears had not been used.5. Synthesis and applications. Members of the fishing industry may object to the creation of permanent closed areas because harvestable stocks can move in space and time. This study indicates that zoned fishery management can allow some sectors of the fishing industry to retain access to fishery resources while protecting benthic species and habitats.",43,2004,10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00945.x,WOS:000224167700015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no mention of MPA

Visual census surveys were periodically conducted along the littoral rocky shores of Lachea, the largest island of the Ciclopi archipelago. The fish assemblage, which comprised 20 species belonging to Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Tripterygiidae, Scorpaenidae and Gobiesocidae, was dominated by Scorpaena maderensis and Trypterigion delaisi. Species richness (S) did not show significant differences between the northern, eastern, southern and western island coasts, whereas both species diversity (H) and evenness (J) were significantly higher on the western coast than on the northern coast. The effect of the island coast on fish density was not significant with regard to the whole assemblage or to single species, except for S. maderensis and T. delaisi. The pattern of variation of assemblage parameters was mainly positively correlated with microhabitat variables, especially substratum composition and type of cover. The best predictors of fish total density were bottom slope, rugosity and substratum composition. Variations in relative species density were specified by a different combination of macro- and microhabitat variables. The density pattern of S. maderensis showed a positive relationship with depth. In T. delaisi, the influence of slope was interrelated to that of exposure to waves. This species preferentially inhabited flat habitat, sheltered from the open sea and covered by small boulders, but also more-exposed rockwalls. The population densities of Tripterygion melanurus and Lipophrys trigloides were negatively affected by depth, thus reflecting their preference for the upper infralittoral.

For most species catch per unit effort (CPUE) in traditional Dema traps fished across park boundaries was higher within the parks (up to an order of magnitude). However, a few species (e.g., the seagrass parrotfish, Leptoscarus uaigensis and the whitespotted rabbitfish, Siganus sutor, WSR) had higher seasonal CPUE outside the parks. Potential spillover of fishes from the parks to adjacent fished areas was tested with a logistic decay model of density gradients (CPUE) across park borders from fringing and patch reefs. A steep decay in CPUE off the Malindi patch reef suggested little spillover of most species. However, greater spillover was suggested off fringing reefs. Species differences were evident. The two most important commercial species showed different density gradients. Species diversity declined more abruptly off the fringing reefs. We conclude that although spillover of most species from the parks is limited, the most important commercial species exhibits significant spillover to adjacent fisheries and the Parks likely comprise important nursery and growth areas for other species.

Here, we examine the intertidal habitats used by marine gastropods for the deposition of benthic egg masses along a wave-exposed coastline in New South Wales, Australia.2. A total of 200 surveys were conducted on 13 intertidal reefs. The egg masses of 46 species were identified, with a further eight distinct types recorded but remaining unidentified. Over half of the gastropods were found to deposit egg masses exclusively on the underside of boulders. Other intertidal substrata used for gastropod egg mass deposition included vertical and horizontal exposed rock surfaces, algal fronds and sand. Only eight species were found to attach their egg masses to more than one type of substratum.3. Twelve reefs were classified into three categories according to exposure to wave action and habitat diversity. The mean number of species found depositing egg masses was compared using a standard eight surveys from each site. Sub-maximally wave-exposed reefs with maximal habitat diversity were found to support a significantly higher species richness of gastropod egg masses, compared with maximally wave-exposed reefs with either maximal or sub-maximal habitat diversity (p = 0.000).4. Gastropods that deposit egg masses on the underside of boulders were more likely to be found on sub-maximally wave-exposed reefs, whereas species that deposit egg masses in all other microhabitats were equally likely to be found breeding on sub-maximally or maximally exposed reefs.5. Gastropods with pelagic larvae tended to occur at a greater number of sites than those that hatch post-metamorphosis. A significant difference was found between species grouped according to these two developmental modes for the mean number of sites at which egg masses were recorded (P = 0.008).6. Variation in the species richness of gastropods found depositing egg masses on different intertidal reefs appears to be influenced by the availability of suitable boulders and exposure to wave action. These factors should be taken into consideration during the selection of locations for intertidal protected areas.

Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that species abundance and the biomass of reef fish populations is higher within than outside marine reserves, and that a north-to-south geographical gradient of these variables exists. We also explored the relationship between the fish assemblage and habitat structure, as an environmental factor likely to account for an important part of the observed variability. The mixed analyses of variance revealed that total abundance and biomass, species richness and abundance and biomass of several target species reached higher average values within marine reserves. Nevertheless, some non-protected localities (e.g. Aguilas) harboured richer and more abundant fish assemblages than some marine reserves. In addition, regional variation, attributable to differences in local carrying capacity and hydroclimatic conditions, are also shown across the studied area. Moreover, the studied assemblage is patchy at small and/or intermediate spatial scales, considering both assemblage descriptors (total abundance and biomass, species richness), and the abundance and biomass of fish species and spatial categories. Detected patterns were different depending on the species and assemblage variables analysed. Differences in habitat structure account for a significant proportion of total variability of the studied variables, and are likely to be responsible for a large part of the observed differences, especially at small-to-intermediate spatial scales. Other factors-spatial variability in larval distribution, settlement and/or post-settlement survival-are discussed in order to explain the observed differences. We concluded that causes of the observed patchiness of Mediterranean reef fish assemblages are probably multiple. Long-term, multi-scale spatial and temporal monitoring actions, as well as process-oriented manipulative experiments are urgently needed in order to ascertain the relative importance of each factor.",198,2004,10.1007/s00227-003-1170-0,WOS:000187504900019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"fished sites have different habitat than protected ones, and the sampling period is different.

The damage caused by ship groundings can be significant and may result in a shift in reef structure and function. In this study we evaluate the status of two restoration projects established in 1995, 6 years after two freighters, the M/V Maitland and the M/V Elpis, ran aground on reefs of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Our approach includes field monitoring in support of simulation model development to assess the effectiveness of the restoration efforts. A population model was developed for the coral Porites astreoides to project the convergence rates of coral abundance and population size structure between the restored and surrounding reference habitats. Coral communities are developing rapidly on the restoration structures. Species richness and abundance of the dominant coral, P. astreoides, were nearly indistinguishable between the restoration structures and reference habitats after only 6 years. However, although abundance and size structure of P. astreoides populations are rapidly approaching those of the reference habitats (a convergence in size structure within 10 years was simulated), maximum coral size will take twice as long to converge for this species. The sensitivity of the model to maximum recruitment rates highlights the importance of recruitment on the recovery rates of restored habitats, suggesting that special attention should be afforded to provide coral recruits with appropriate recruitment substrate at the time of restoration. Finally, the rates of convergence and, hence, the level of success of a restoration effort were shown to be influenced not only by the recruitment and survivorship rates of corals on the restoration structures but by the characteristics of the reference population as well. Accordingly, reference populations ought to be considered a moving target against which restoration success has to be measured dynamically. The simple, cost-effective, monitoring-modeling approach presented here can provide the necessary tools to assess the current status of a restoration effort and to project the time required for coral populations to resemble those found on undamaged reference habitats",36,2003,10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.rec0286.x,WOS:000186531800006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,study of an active method of coral reef restoration

Cumulative species-site curves indicated that complementarity maximized the rate of accumulation of species of both corals and fishes in reserves, while the hotspot approach performed moderately well. An equivalent number of reserve sites supported a greater proportion of the coral biodiversity when compared to fishes, reflecting the broader distribution of corals. Our results indicate that when choosing an indicator group as a proxy for representing overall diversity in a reserve network, the group with the greatest heterogeneity will provide the best results. Our findings also show that although a modest number of protected sites (20%) will incorporate much of the local diversity (>75%), species- specific approaches must be incorporated to target rare species.

Knowledge of the conditions associated with fast or slow community assembly in the tropics would enhance our ability to predict recovery from natural and anthropogenic disturbance and to conserve biodiversity. Here we report an unusually rapid doubling of species richness within a year in a tropical, subtidal sessile invertebrate community in a protected (non- extractive) zone of the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). Diversity changes in the rock wall community were accompanied by large increases in the percent cover, density and/or biomass of sponges, barnacles, ascidians, and an ahermatypic coral, Tubastrea coccinea, over the 1-year study period (1999-2000). Barnacle (Megabalanus peninsularis) and ascidian (Didemnum cineraceum) biomasses increased by an order of magnitude from 1999 to 2000. The greater abundance of sessile invertebrate prey was accompanied by significant increases in the abundance of barnacle and Tubastrea predators (Hexaplex princeps, Asperiscala billeeana). An estimated 37% of barnacle tissue biomass production was consumed in 1 year. Temperature monitoring during the study period showed that this site is characterized by strong upwelling, where rapid, 3.0-9.08degreesC decreases in temperature occurred at harmonics of the semi-diurnal tidal periodicity during warm (January-February), but not during cool months (June-July). Short-term acoustic current meter measurements revealed strong, highly variable upwelling at the study site, with events ranging from 2-111 min in duration and maximum upwelling velocities of 32.3 cm s(-1). These findings suggest that the turnover of diversity and biomass may be unusually rapid at tropical upwelling sites, especially where invertebrate predators are protected from harvesting.

Community-based marine protected areas in the Philippines,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,,"In 1985, in response to declining coral reef conditions, local residents and officials established small, no-take marine sanctuaries on Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands through a community-based process. The implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) on Baticasag and Pamilacan Islands has been a partial success. As a direct result of protection, living hard coral cover has increased by 119% in Balicasag's sanctuary and by 67% in the non-sanctuary during the period 1984 to 1999, but Balicasag's reef is increasingly affected by breakage from anchors from dive boats and Crown-of-thorns starfish infestations. During the same period, living hard coral cover decreased by 20% in Pamilacan's sanctuary and by 45% in the non-sanctuary from 1984 to 1999. The decrease in living hard coral cover in Pamilacan's sanctuary is most likely a result of the 1998 bleaching event, Crown-of-thorn starfish and possible storm damage. Although there was an initial increase in the economically important target fish abundance in the Balicasag sanctuary and non-sanctuary and in the Pamilacan sanctuary during the first two years of implementation in the mid-1980s, there has since been a significant decline. Mean target fish abundance for the Balicasag non-sanctuary at 230 (+/-65) individuals per 500 m(2) is not significantly different from control sites without MPAs on nearby Panglao and Cabilao Islands at 164 (+/-67) individuals per 500 m(2). In general, fish abundance and diversity inside and outside the sanctuaries peaked in 1986, a year after the establishment of the sanctuaries when enforcement was strictest. Therefore, despite considerable success in enforcing regulations associated with these small MPAs at Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands, a trend of declining fish abundance and species richness among economically valuable species immediately outside the no-take areas highlights the limitations of small and isolated MPAs. This study contributes to the growing sentiment that it is not realistic for scattered, small no-take areas to maintain fish abundance and diversity on surrounding reefs when intensive fishing effort immediately adjacent to no-take areas removes most fish that exit these areas. This finding emphasizes the importance of nesting individual MPAs within broader management regimes that lead to overall fishing effort reduction and networking of MPAs. Among other recommendations, the authors advocate for continued support for community-based MPAs, a network of MPAs, reduced fishing effort in areas surrounding the MPAs and other management measures to improve the quality of the coral reef habitats.

Remediation was attempted: hard and soft corals were transplanted to part of one impact area shortly after the accident, debris was removed from part of another, and the substrate was repaired with cast concrete forms at the third area. Few fishes are found immediately after such impacts., but fishes should return to impacted sites along with other life, recovering to resemble either assemblages characteristic of complex reefs, or assemblages of simpler hard ground habitat. During 1995 and 1996, fishes were surveyed at five impact sites dispersed among the three impact areas., three spur-and-groove sites, four natural hard ground sites, and a hard ground site where ships had grounded 100 yrs ago. Patterns of species composition were explored through cluster analysis; diversities and overall abundances of fishes were compared among sites, with subsequent comparisons of paired remediated and unremediated sites. Irrespective of initial structural complexity of a grounding site, fish assemblages converged to low diversity, low abundance assemblages with species composition typical of natural hard ground. A preponderance of opportunistic wrasses that eat post-larval invertebrates, combined with a lack of large parrotfishes, may prevent recovery of such structurally impoverished sites to a well-developed spur-and-groove formation by hindering recolonization by corals.

Third, the most common type of competitive interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries will be that in which commercial fisheries adversely affect a marine-mammal population by depleting localized food resources without necessarily overfishing the target species of fish (or shellfish).

Suitable techniques to restore enriched grasslands and reestablish native communities are increasingly needed. Here we report results of a 5-yr experiment in enriched coastal prairie grasslands (Bodega Marine Reserve, Bodega Bay, California, USA), to determine the combined effects of mowing and biomass removal on total soil nitrogen, net rates of mineralization, nitrogen retention, and species richness and biomass. We mowed and removed plant biomass from plots in areas where the N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), had greatly enriched the soil, and where the community was composed of weedy introduced plants. Our goal was to facilitate the establishment of the native grassland assemblage such as was found at nearby low soil nitrogen sites.Mowing and biomass removal resulted in a dramatic change in the species assemblage, from exotic annual grasses to a mixed exotic/native forb community composed primarily of perennials. Species richness was significantly greater in treated plots than in control plots weedy exotic grasses diminished in abundance, and both native and exotic forb species increased. In mowed vs. control plots, there was significantly less mean aboveground biomass, but significantly greater belowground biomass. This shift in species composition had significant impacts on nitrogen retention. In late fall and winter when plant-available N was highest, much nitrogen leached from the effectively fallow control plots where germination of annual grasses did not peak until midwinter. In contrast, mowed plots retained substantially greater amounts of nitrogen, due to the presence of perennial plants possessing large amounts of belowground biomass early in the season.

Population density, species richness, and rarity were estimated for 127 species of coral reef fish on 22 patch and fringing reefs along similar to 400 km of East African coastline. The reefs included five protected areas, of which three study sites were protected for more than 25 years, and four sites were protected less than 10 years. Habitat variables were often significantly associated with fish community variables in fringing reefs, but not in patch reefs. Fish diversity was positively correlated with hard coral and coralline algal cover, and negatively correlated with sea urchin and algal turf abundance. However, multiple regression analysis suggests that protection from fishing was the single strongest factor affecting fish abundance and diversity. Consequently, many of the habitat correlations were probably due to direct and indirect effects of fishing on reef ecology, where heavy fishing results in increases in sea urchin and algal turf abundance and reduces hard coral and coralline algal abundance. Protected areas had higher abundances and species richness of commercially important triggerfish, surgeonfish, and parrotfish. There was, however, no relationship between local rarity in our study sites with rarity at the level of the western Indian Ocean for three well known fish families of angelfish, butterflyfish, and damselfish.

The Exuma Gays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP), covering 442 km(2) in the central Bahamas, was established in 1958 and closed to fishing in 1986, making it one of the first acid largest marine reserves or 'no-take' zones in the western Atlantic. The ECLSP is ideally situated between small-scale developments in the northern and southern Exuma Gays and encompasses a diversity of contiguous shallow-water habitats from the Great Bahama Bank to the eastern platform margin in Exuma Sound. Scientific investigations during the past decade have compared queen conch, spiny lobster, and grouper resources in the ECLSP to those in adjacent fished areas and have demonstrated greater species diversity, density, biomass, potential reproductive output, and larval densities for these species. The lack of historical data limits determination of whether closure to fishing has resulted in increases in these attributes over time, but available data strongly support the contention that the ECLSP has significantly greater spawning-stock biomass of various organisms because of protection from fishing. Although evidence is strong that the ECLSP is an important source of larvae to adjacent areas in the Exuma Sound ecosystem, few data show adult emigration to fished areas. Some target species outside the reserve may have declined, and because the ECLSP probably depends on larval transport from upcurrent areas, awareness is growing that this reserve will not be successful in isolation. Experiences in the ECLSP suggest that marine reserves will be most successful if they contain contiguous habitats from bank to deeper shelf (>30 m) environments, minimize threats such as coastal development, and provide protection of unique features such as spawning aggregations.",47,2000,,WOS:000088894300013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no mention of species richness or other usable biodiversity indicator

The largest reserve at Maria Island (7 km coastline length) proved the most effective at achieving species conservation and resource enhancement. The number of fish, invertebrate and algal species, the densities of large fishes ( > 325 mm length), bastard trumpeter (Latridopsis forsteri) and rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii), and the mean size of blue-throated wrasse (Notolabrus tetricus) and abalone (Haliotis rubra), all increased significantly within the Maria Island reserve relative to external reference sites. Increases of an order of magnitude in the biomass of rock lobsters and two orders of magnitude in the abundance of trumpeter were particularly noticeable. Small abalone declined in density within the reserve, while large abalone became more numerous. The effectiveness of marine reserves corresponded with reserve size. Changes in species richness of fishes, invertebrates or plants were not detected in any of the three smaller reserves, other than an increase in number of fish species greater than 325 mm size within the Tinderbox marine reserve (2 km reserve length). Although patterns were partly obscured by the low power of statistical tests, trends were generally evident at the Tinderbox reserve for increasing densities of large fishes and rock lobsters, and for increases in the mean size of rock lobsters, abalone and blue-throated wrasse. Most of these trends were not apparent in the reserves with small reef areas at Governor Island (1 km reserve length) and Ninepin Point (1 km length). Rock lobsters above the legal size limit nevertheless became abundant in all reserves by the end of the study while remaining rare outside. Indirect changes to reef assemblages were also detected following the declaration of the Maria Island marine reserve. Accompanying the increase in macroalgal species richness was a change in predominant plant species from Cystophora retroflexa to Ecklonia radiata. Results of this study provide the first clear evidence that shallow Tasmanian reef ecosystems are overfished, and that unfished coastal ecosystems differ substantially from those where fishing occurs. The most noticeable changes caused by fishing were the virtual elimination of net-susceptible and heavily targeted species, which may otherwise be common, plus indirect changes to algal communities. We suggest that ecosystem change associated with fishing of shallow coastal reefs may be a widespread phenomenon worldwide. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A study was undertaken of human culture and fisheries resources in an area of southern Kenya, designated as a national marine reserve, to determine the effect of the existing 'traditional management' on fisheries yields and on the ecological condition of the fished reefs. This area has one of the oldest and most elaborate cultural traditions concerning sacred sites and rituals of sacrifice along the Kenyan coast. The purpose of the customs is, however, to appease spirits rather than to regulate fish stocks which are traditionally seen to fluctuate independently of fishing effort. Many of these traditions have decayed in recent times as Islamization of the culture has occurred, and authority has shifted towards national organizations, weakening the effectiveness of the traditional leaders. Coincidentally, fishers have adopted new or foreign gear, colleagues, and traditions. Two adjacent landing sites (Mvuleni and Mwanyaza) have, however, successfully stopped pull seiners from landing their catch at their sites for over 20 years through passive means. Other landing sites have adopted pull seining. Both landing areas use arguments based on tradition to justify their use of gear. The two landings that restrict pull seining have higher per capita fish catches than those that do not. Nonetheless, there were no obvious differences in the ecological condition of the reefs at these two management areas; both areas were amongst the most degraded reefs reported in East Africa. Biological diversity and coral cover were reduced greatly in all these areas compared to other fished or fully-protected marine park or reserve sites established by the national government. Presently, traditional management is not effective in protecting species diversity or ecological functions, which was probably never the intention of the customs. The conflict between national organizations and local fishers arises because some resource users are concerned that the management proposed by the national organizations will eventually lead to the total loss of access to, and control of the resource by local fishers. There is, therefore, a need to resolve conflicts concerning gear use and regulation, and a need to increase awareness of the expectations and management programmes among the national and local organizations. Many of the traditional forms of management are compatible with the policies of national organizations, but confusion and conflict occur concerning enforcement and its benefits. To solve these conflicts discussions are required between traditional and national fisheries leaders to develop mutually-acceptable policies that augment and share the power of management.",105,1997,10.1017/S0376892997000179,WOS:A1997YJ45000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,the study is not designed to anderstand the impact of MPA

Fish assemblages varied in structure between reef types and among habitats within reef types. Functional aspects of habitat structure and composition, such as available food and shelter, seemed to be important factors influencing distribution patterns. The strongest separation in the organisation of fish assemblages in BRMS was between reef types: 19% of all species were confined to the coral-reef patches while 22% were restricted to the sandstone reef patches and 59% were represented on both reef types. In terms of distribution among habitats, 21% of all species were restricted to one habitat while only 1.5% were present in all.

This habitat also had the highest proportion of species with restricted distribution. Planktivores were the most abundant trophic group in BRMS, and the species composition of the group varied among habitats.

Two sites were protected from fishing for over 20 years, whereas the other five sites were heavily fished in recent years. A heavily fished site was converted into a marine park (Mombasa Marine National Park, approximately 10km(2), no fishing allowed), and the number of fishers allowed was slowly decreased between August 1991 and August 1992. The area adjacent to the park was converted into a marine reserve (only fishing traps, lines, and gill nets allowed) that provided fishing grounds for fishers excluded from the park. Data from a fish-landing site adjacent to the newly created marine park were collected for 3 years and analyzed to determine the effect of the park's creation on fish catches. Results suggest that fishing in the reserve reduced fish wet weight by about a factor of 10 and reduced fish numbers and species richness by a factor of two. Both field studies and landing site's fishing grounds were protected with the creation of the park, and 65% of the fishers quit the studied landing, leaving nearly the same density of fishers in the remaining area (similar to 12 fishers/km(2)). Further, fishers using pull seines were excluded from the reserve, and their numbers were replaced by fishers using other gear (mostly basket traps). Although the overall catch per unit effort increased by about 110% after the park's creation, the total fish landed decreased by 35% and the catch per unit effort decreased toward the end of the study period despite increasing fish abundance in the park. Although establishment of small parks elsewhere have increased the total catch, the large park we studied did not; one reason may nave been the lower ratio of edge to park area of the large park. Alternatively, the park's edge may have provided a good fishing area, so fishing effort may have been highest along the park's edge. Consequently, a barrier may have been created that restricted fish dispersal to most of the reserve. Therefore, the area that had an increased catch was small (<1 to 2km from the edge) and could not compensate for the lose fishing area. Most fish species within the park showed recovery after fisher exclusion. Total fish wet weights 3 years after the fisher's exclusion were 25% below the older marine parks. Poor recovery of the herbivorous parrot and surgeonfish can account for much of this shortfall. Competition for resources with sea urchins appear to be slowing recovery of these two groups.

The marine reserve (sanctuary) at Apo Island was established in 1982 and was protected from fishing for the duration of the study. The non-reserve area was open to fishing by up to 200 municipal fishers using traditional fishing gear (bamboo traps, hooks and lines, gill nets and spears). Significant positive correlations of both mean density and species richness of large predatory fish with duration of reserve protection (from 1 to 11 yr) were observed in both the reserve and non-reserve areas surveyed. The minimum distance from the boundary of the reserve to the non-reserve area surveyed was 200 m. During the first 8 yr of reserve protection combined, the density of large predatory fish at distances 200 to 300, 300 to 400 and 400 to 500 m from the reserve boundary did not differ significantly from an even distribution (chi-squared test, p > 0.05). During the period of 9 to 11 yr of protection combined, there was a significantly higher density of these fish in the area closest to the reserve (i.e. in the 200 to 300 m area, chi-squared test, p < 0.05). This visual census data is consistent with a proposed model of adult fish export from the reserve to the non-reserve areas. Along with interview data collected in 1986 and 1992 that showed that fishers were unanimous that their yields had increased since the reserve was implemented, this study provides evidence for export of adult fish from reserve to fished areas.",272,1996,10.3354/meps132001,WOS:A1996UD22300001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,

Both total species richness and global abundance did not differ significantly between protected and non-protected areas. Nevertheless, there were significant differences for numerous families and species. Most of the big carnivorous fishes (Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae) were more diverse and more abundant in the marine reserve. Conversely, other fishes, mainly in the families Pomacentridae, Scaridae and Acanthuridae, presented the opposite pattern. The mean biomass of commercial fish species was significantly higher in the reserve (202 g.m(-2)) than in non-protected areas (79 g.m(-2)). This pattern was also evident for carnivorous fishes, such as Epinephelus microdon, and semi-pelagic fishes, such as Caesionidae. In contrast, other commercial species, such as Scarus caudovittatus and Acanthurus nigricauda had higher biomass in non-protected areas. Despite this apparent contradiction, our results seem to be linked with the marine reserve protection. Cessation of fishing activities in the reserve may have caused increases in diversity, abundance and biomass of large carnivores. The decrease in the number of these fishes in non-protected areas due to fishing may favour development of other populations, dominated by potential prey for carnivorous fishes.",27,1996,10.1080/11956860.1996.11682362,WOS:A1996WD61600009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,out,,

A qualitative survey published in 1974 reported a total of 34 coral species in the region, and more recent records include a total of 55 coral species. Here, we present the results of the first quantitative benthic surveys for 7 sites in the Solitary Islands Marine Reserve. As a result of these surveys, an additional 35 species of scleractinian coral have been recorded from the region, bringing the total to 90 coral species, in 28 genera from 11 families. However, 21 of the 55 coral species previously recorded were not found during this study. These results indicate that a dynamic temporal pattern of species recuitment and replacement is occurring within these subtropical coral communities. Scleractinian coral cover ranged from a low of 8.5 % at Muttonbird Island, the reef closest to the coastline, to 50.9 % at SW Solitary Island. These values are within the range of coral cover reported for tropical fringing reefs. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated 4 major site groupings: the 2 sites closest to shore; the most northern offshore site, which was different from all other sites; South Solitary Island; and the other 3 island sites which showed some similarity to one another. The major differences among sites were higher coral species richness and the relative importance of Acropora species on the more northern and offshore reefs, and higher abundance of large macroalgae close to the coastline. The Solitary Islands coral communities contain a unique association of tropical species near their southern latitudinal range, and subtropical scleractinian species which are rare or absent from the Great Barrier Reef region. Although coral cover is high at the Solitary Islands, these high-latitude sites are less diverse than tropical fringing reefs, with respect to both total number of coral species and the number of species per sampling unit. Furthermore, the primary substratum is formed by rock rather than limestone, so the extensive coral communities fail to form coral reefs at this latitude.",94,1994,10.3354/meps109067,WOS:A1994NT10500006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no control outside or before the MPA

Sites were established in the integral reserve (protection of the marine environment), in the non-integral reserve (partial protection) and outside the reserve (no protection). Average density and biomass of the sampled population in P. oceanica seagrass beds showed no significant difference between the sites in the integral reserve and the others. Only the integrally-protected shallow and deep water zones showed considerably reduced seasonal variations. For rocky substrata, the integral reserve site demonstrated higher density and biomass than the other sites. The impact of seasonal variations on the sampled population was not reduced in this biotope, as in the seagrass beds. Whatever the biotope, the demographic structures of the fish population sampled in the integral reserve and in the other sites were different: the number of large fishes (matured adults) was always the highest. Species diversity was slightly greater in the seagrass bed sites of the integral reserve, but site variations were not significant. This was also true for rocky substrata; in contrast, lesser seasonal differences were recorded in the integral reserve than outside. Three conclusions can be drawn from these pluriannual observations: 1) The reserve effect is real, not just theoretical, and affects the fish population in both rocks and seagrass beds. 2) The two sites studied, the Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and rocky substrata, react very differently to protection which reduces anthropogenic disturbances. These differences may be attributed to the degree of sensitivity of the dominant families (Labridae in the seagrass, Sparidae in rocky substrata) to all disturbances. 3) The reserve effect comprises both a refuge and a buffer effect. The refuge effect is the most traditionally highlighted and is characterized by more large fishes and a greater variety of species and noble fishes (Dicentrarchus labrax, Sparus aurata, Epinephelus marginatus, Sciaena umbra). The buffer effect, never shown in previous studies, is characterized by the fact that the impact of seasonal variations on parameters such as density, biomass, and diversity is considerably lessened.",121,1994,,WOS:A1994PV50000008,field,CI,1992,MPA,Scandola,17,old,1975,FPA,fully,0.72,5.90,medium,NA,France,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean sea,mix,,ecological,fish,mix,fished,mix,,community-based,,biodiversity,,shannon,"Results, Diversity",positive,,number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no value of interest

The monitored areas included two photostations in the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, two photostations in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, and two photostations in the Biscayne National Park. Stations were monitored for species number, percent cover, and species diversity of the scleractinian and hydrozoan stony corals. Monitoring began in 1984 for photostations in the National Marine Sanctuaries and in 1989 for stations in the National Park.All six areas lost coral species between the initial survey year and 1991. Survey areas lost between one and four species; these losses constituted between 13% and 29% of their species richness. Five of the six areas lost live coral cover. Based upon photographs taken repeatedly at these locations, net losses ranged between 7.3% and 43.9%. In the one station showing an increase in coral cover, the increase was only for the canopy branches of Acropora palmata; understory branches of this same species lost surface area at the same rate as canopy branches gained area. For most of the common species, there was a reduction in the total number of living colonies in the community, and a diminution in the number of large, mature colonies. Throughout the study period, there was no recruitment to any of the photostations by any of the massive frame building coral species.Mortality of this magnitude is often associated with hurricane damage, but in this survey the losses occurred during a period without catastrophic storms. Sources of mortality identifiable in the photographs include (1) black band disease and (2) ''bleaching''; other potential sources of mortality are also considered. We conclude, for our survey areas, that loss rates of this magnitude cannot be sustained for protracted periods if the coral community is to persist in a configuration resembling historical coral reef community structure in the Florida Keys.",193,1992,,WOS:A1992KV05500002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,no error associated with the values

We examined the role of marine protected areas (MPAs) in reducing disease in corals and the hypothesis that the composition of fish communities can influence coral health, by comparing disease prevalence between MPA and non-protected (control) reefs in Palau. Overall, the prevalence of diseases pooled, as well as the prevalence of skeletal eroding band (SEB), brown band disease (BrB) and growth anomalies (GAs) individually in major disease hosts (families Acroporidae and Poritidae), were not significantly reduced within MPAs. In fact, the prevalence of SEB was 2-fold higher within MPAs overall; however, the 4 studied MPAs were ineffective in enhancing coral assemblage or fish stock health. A negative association between the prevalence of SEB and richness of a fish species targeted by fishers in Palau highlights the potential role that well-managed MPAs could play in reducing SEB. The composition of coral communities and their susceptibility to bleaching also influenced the prevalence of disease on the studied reefs. The prevalence of diseases pooled and SEB were positively associated with the cover of major disease hosts (families Acroporidae and Poritidae), and the prevalence of BrB and bleaching were also positively associated. Although our study did not show positive effects of MPAs on coral heath, we did identify the potential for increased fish diversity within MPAs to reduce coral disease.

Methods Reef fish abundance and size structure, by species, were obtained monthly using replicated underwater visual belt transects (n = 8; 70 · 5-m belt transects) over 3 years (2002–2005) at eight sites that included six marine reserves and two unprotected reef areas. We analysed species accumulation curves, diversity indices and abundance–biomass comparison (ABC) curves within and across the study sites to assess the influence of protection duration and location. Results Analyses showed that longer protection duration impacted reef fish diversity at both inshore and offshore sites by shifting ABC curves from higher abundance than biomass curves at fished sites to higher biomass than abundance curves at most of the protected sites. Protection duration did not significantly influence either the rate of species accumulation within sites or the 12 diversity indices measured across the study sites. The offshore sites consistently showed higher rates of species accumulation and diversity indices values than inshore sites with similar protection duration. One protected offshore young marine reserve site that has been assessed as the least well-managed showed patterns more consistent with the fished sites.
