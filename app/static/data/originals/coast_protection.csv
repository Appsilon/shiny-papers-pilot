Measurements were conducted on offshore and foreshore morphology (topography, bathymetry), on hydrodynamics (waves, water levels, and currents) under different wind conditions within and outside the meadow, and on meadow biometry (shoot density, leaf length). The main impact of this patchy meadow on wind-wave transformations seems to be attenuation of waves further offshore than in the absence of vegetation. This attenuation is particularly notable above the meadow front edge, and is related to wave heights, water levels, and wave periods that are, in turn, dependent on wind intensity and fetch length. The data show that the patchy meadow does not attenuate small and short waves, especially when water levels are high, but is capable, like salt marshes and artificial seagrass, of attenuating relatively high and long waves. Notwithstanding its patchy and degraded character, the meadow also strongly influences the vertical distribution of currents. Whereas currents are strong and significantly influenced by wind and wind waves above the meadow, both waves and currents are dissipated in a transitional canopy-water layer. These wave and current modifications are reflected in the evolution of the seabed. Erosion and sedimentation are mainly controlled by the hydrodynamics but the seasonal state of the meadow plays a role by modulating the hydrodynamics. These substrate changes are, important, in turn, in influencing protection of the shoreline.",3,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,France,Europe,temperate,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their contribution to habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem health is considerable. With the substantial decline in size and number of wetlands along the shores of the Great Lakes in the last 50 years the practical use of aquatic plants can provide shore protection and restore areas of lost wetlands. In order to combine biological and engineering requirements more has to be known about the functional design of shoreline wetlands and the specific ability of aquatic plants to attenuate wave energy.This paper discusses recent research activities of the Queen's University Coastal Engineering Research Laboratory (QUCERL) to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and application of aquatic vegetation and wetlands for incorporation into shore protection schemes. Specifically, it examines the results of a study of a wetland at the Lemoine Point Conservation Area along Collins Bay in Lake Ontario near Kingston. The wave climate at the site was analyzed and the wetland site was instrumented with pressure sensors to monitor the wave transformation as the waves pass through the emergent aquatic vegetation. This field study is complemented by a series of laboratory tests on plants in a wave flume at QUCERL. The wave heights were reduced in both studies by typically 20 to 40 percent through the wetland plants. A more detailed knowledge of the relationship between wave parameters and vegetation characteristics in reducing wave energy will strengthen the engineering basis for the use of aquatic vegetation and increase opportunities for conservation and human use and enjoyment of 'naturally' protected shores.",1998,1998,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,United Kingdom,Europe,temperate,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The energy spectrum of the cross-reef currents shows a significant peak at twice the semidiurnal tidal frequency, while the spectrum;m of sea surface elevation dyer the reef flat shows no corresponding peak. Furthermore, experimental results reported by Gourlay (1993) show setup over the reef occurs in the absence of a beach, and the cross-reef transport decreases with an increase in the sea surface slope across the reef flat due to an increase in setup at the top of the reef face. Analytic solutions for flow forced by wave breaking over an idealized reef explain the above features of cross-reef flows in the absence of a beach. Through the surf zone on the reef face the cross-reef gradient in the radiation stress due to wave breaking is partitioned between balancing an offshore pressure gradient associated with setup over the reef and forcing a mean flow across the reef. Over the reef flat, where the depth is constant, there is no forcing due to wave breaking and the flow is driven by a pressure gradient which results from the setup through the surf zone. The magnitude of the setup through the surf zone is such that the transport across the reef flat matches the transport through the surf zone which is forced by the gradient in the radiation stress. Solutions are presented for general reef geometry, defined by the reef width and slope of the seaward reef face, and incident wave forcing, defined by the depth at the breakpoint and the depth of water over the reef. As the depth over the reef goes to zero, the solutions converge to the plane beach solutions described by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964), wave setup is maximized, and the cross-reef transport is zero. In other cases the relative magnitudes of the setup and the cross-reef transport depend on the geometry of the reef and the incident wave forcing.",FEB 15 1995,1995,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field measurements of wind waves at three locations on a sand flat to salt marsh cross-shore transect showed that wave energy dissipation rates over the salt marsh were significantly higher (at an average of 82%) than over the sand flat (at an average of 29%). The difference in water depth between the sand flat and salt marsh sections of the transect was not sufficient to account for the difference in wave attenuation, indicating that an increase in surface friction is the primary reason for increased wave attenuation over the salt marsh. Comparison of the field results with a numerical model based on theoretical wave energy dissipation suggests that surface friction factors of the order of less than or equal to 0.4 are responsible for the high values of wave attenuation over the salt marsh. The results provide empirical support, both for maintaining salt marshes in front of existing sea defence lines and for creating new salt marsh as part of coastal set-back/shoreline realignment schemes.

Transformation regulates the amount of wave energy entering reef systems, however there have been relatively few hydrodynamic assessments conducted on coral reefs when compared to siliciclastic environments with the effects of common geomorphic features like rubble platforms on wave transformation never specifically examined. This study focuses on the changes in wave characteristics across a rubble platform in a high energy environment (One Tree Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef). Wave conditions were measured at five locations over two days along a cross-reef transect from the reef rim to lagoon. Most of the wave energy was dissipated during wave breaking with energy attenuation due to bottom friction a secondary process. Wave energy attenuation was between 60-99% of the offshore wave conditions only during high tide would wave propagation across the reef platform be capable of affecting reef geomorphology. The wave spectrum also changed with the shorter period gravity wave energy (3 - 20 s) almost completely expending during transformation while longer period infragravity waves (20 - 300 s) were capable of propagating across the reef platform. Wave heights were depth limited and primarily controlled by water depth which suggests that water depth over the reef platform and subsequently elevation of the reef platform above mean sea level govern the amount of wave energy transferred across into reef systems, with most of the gravity wave energy removed during propagation over coral rubble platforms.",13,2013,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field results illustrate that SS waves are tidally modulated at the shoreline, with comparatively greater wave attenuation and setup occurring at low tide versus high tide. A shoreward increase in IG wave height is observed across the 100 m wide reef flat at all tidal elevations, with no tidal modulation of IG wave height at the reef flat or island shoreline. A 1-D shock-capturing Green-Naghdi solver is used to replicate the field deployment and analyze R-max. Model outputs for SS wave height, IG wave height and setup at the shoreline match field results with model skill >0.96. Model outputs for R-max are used to identify the temporal window when geomorphic activity can occur on the beach face. During periods of moderate swell energy, waves can impact the beach face at spring low tide, due to a combination of wave setup and strong IG wave activity. Under mean wave conditions, the combined influence of setup, IG waves and SS waves results in interaction with island sediment at midtide. At high tide, SS and IG waves directly impact the beach face. Overall, wave activity is present on the beach face for 71% of the study period, a significantly longer duration than is calculated using mean water level and topographic data.",33,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trunks of the mangroves are assumed to be in the upper layer inviscid fluid domain, whilst the roots are inside the viscoelastic bed. The associated equation of motion is obtained by coupling the Voigt's model for flow within the viscoelastic medium with the equation of motion in the presence of mangroves. The modified dynamic conditions are coupled with the kinematic conditions to obtain the boundary condition at the free surface and the interface of the two fluids consisting of the upper layer inviscid fluid and the viscoelastic fluid bed. To understand the effects of bed viscosity as well as elasticity on energy dissipation, the complex dispersion relation associated with the plane progressive wave is derived and analyzed. Effect of physical parameters associated with mangroves and viscoelastic bed on wave motion in surface and internal modes are computed and analyzed to understand their roles in attenuating wave effects. The present model will be useful in the better understanding of wave propagation through mangroves in the coastal zone having muddy seabed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study describes results from detailed wave and current measurements, under nonstorm conditions, along five reef flat transects on these reef systems and examines implications for surface geomorphic processes. Results show that wave frequency and transformation varies between reefs in a consistent manner dependent on tidal elevation, reef elevation, and reef width. A nondimensional reef energy window index (T) is developed that incorporates these critical factors (water depth at spring high tide and reef width). A statistically significant relation (95% confidence interval) between IV and the proportion of time that wave energy propagates across reefs illustrates the index ability to characterise the wave process regime of reef flats and provide a physically meaningful descriptor of the efficacy of geomorphic processes on reefs. High values of T indicate narrow and low-elevation reef flats, which are exposed to high wave energy and are geomorphically active. Low values reflect wide and high-elevation reef flats associated with less active wave and geomorphic processes. Results show that while incident energy is undoubtedly an important factor for reef geomorphology, the nature of wave modification across reef flats is equally important in governing levels of geomorphic activity that control development of surface geomorphic features on reef platforms.",06-Jan,2006,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes results from a field experiment conducted at Cape Chevalier in the southeast of Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles, French West Indies), and investigates spatial and temporal variations in wave characteristics across a microtidal coral reef and lagoon. Measurements of wave pressure fluctuations were obtained using three pressure sensors deployed across the reef from 28 to 30 November, 2011. Analysis of the measured data shows that wave characteristics were strongly influenced by water depth and reef geometry. Calculations of energy dissipation indicate an average energy reduction of 91.5% between the fore-reef and back-reef (86% at high tide and 98% at low tide). The mean energy reduction between the fore-reef and the beach was 95.5% (92% and 99% respectively at high and low tide). The incident waves measured at the fore-reef during the experiment were predominantly trade wind-generated with peak periods between 7 and 10 s. Depending on tidal elevation and water depth, back-reef waves were characterized by an energy distribution dominated by the peak 7-10 s gravity waves at high tide and by infragravity frequencies (>20 s) at low tide. Wave energy at the beach was dominated by infragravity frequencies during both high tide and low tide.

In the present experimental study, the attenuation of regular waves propagating in a channel through flexible vegetation is investigated. Specifically, artificial plants mimicking Spartina maritima are considered. Different plant densities and arrangements are tested, as well as different submergence ratios. Measurements of wave characteristics by six wave gauges, distributed all along the vegetated stretch, allow us to estimate the wave energy dissipation. The flow resistance opposed by vegetation is inferred by considering that drag and dissipation coefficients are strictly related. The submergence ratio and the stem density, rather than the wave characteristics, affect the drag coefficient the most. A comparison with the results obtained in the case when the same vegetation is placed in a uniform flow is also shown. It confirms that the drag coefficient for the canopy is lower than for an isolated cylinder, even if the reduction is not affected by the stem density, underlining that flow unsteadiness might be crucial in the process of dissipation.",14,2018,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.",Wave energy and wave-induced flow reduction by full-scale model Posidonia oceanica seagrass,"This paper presents results from experiments in a large flume on wave and flow attenuation by a full-scale artificial Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow in shallow water. Wave height and in-canopy wave-induced flows were reduced by the meadow under all tested regular and irregular wave conditions, and were affected by seagrass density, submergence and distance from the leading edge. The energy of irregular waves was reduced at all components of the spectra, but reduction was greater at the peak spectral frequency. Energy dissipation factors were largest for waves with small orbital amplitudes and at low wave Reynolds numbers. An empirical model, commonly applied to predict friction factors by rough beds, proved applicable to the P. oceanica bed. However at the lowest Reynolds numbers, under irregular waves, the data deviated significantly from the model. In addition, the wave-induced flow dissipation in the lower canopy increased with increasing wave orbital amplitude and increasing density of the mimics. The analysis of the wave-induced flow spectra confirm this trend: the reduction of flow was greatest at the longer period component of the spectra. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for sediment dynamics and the role of P. oceanica beds in protecting the shore from erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was aimed at the determination of the wave transformation over a shallow natural reef in front of the resort and for the design of the nibble mound revetments to be built for coastal protection. Due to the heavy wave breaking on the reef, physical model tests were the only viable avenue for obtaining a reliable design of the revetment structures located behind the shallow reef area. The stability of the armour layer as well as the overtopping of the revetments were equally important aspects of this part of the study, since not only should the resort be protected against storm waves, but visitors should also be able to comfortably visit the coastal areas during more normal wave conditions.This paper mainly concerns the wave dynamics on the reef Due to the limited water depth the wave conditions were dominated by heavy wave breaking and the associated release of the bound long-period wave components in the LL ave groups of the incident wave train. These long-period wave components caused a dynamic water level set-up with long-period variations in front of the revetments (surf beats). The depth-limited wave conditions on the reef and the dynamic water level set-lip had major influence on the evolution of damage and overtopping of the revetments and made the design of the revetments particularly complex.",1999,1999,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not only because they are threatened by climate change, but also because of the important role they play in coastal protection. Some field studies based on Rhizophora mangrove trees have analyzed the force induced by water flow over their roots and the wave dissipation capacity of these trees under tidal regimes and sea waves. Various methods have been used to calculate energy dissipation in the past, but these do not include the drag coefficient (C-D) with field data calibration. The study presented here was conducted to investigate the capacity of a small natural Rhizophora mangrove patch (at experimental scale) located on Isla Grande in the Colombian Caribbean Sea to mitigate wave energy. The total energy dissipation, including the slope bottom and the effects of vegetation, was calculated. Parametric equations were used to calculate the effects of vegetation. The drag force (F-D) was computed using Morrison's equation and the C-D was calculated using Mazda's method. The results show a mean energy dissipation difference of 9.6% between the energy balance and dissipation coefficients wherethe C-D was calculated for each sea state. The dissipation coefficients were calculated with constant C-D values (0.06, 3.48 and 6.90). None of the three cases could explain the 90.4% energy flux, as in the case of vegetation dissipation (D-veg) with calculated and non-constant C-D values. Despite the small size of the mangrove patch, the results show an increase in the C-D (with values of up to 7.9) as a result of lower values of the Reynolds number (R-e) (about 7.3 x 10(5)). This demonstrates experimentally the role that even a small patch of mangrove vegetation plays in attenuating sea waves (as C-D is a function of sea states), and higher magnitudes were obtained than those recorded in the literature using other vegetation types. A nonlinear contribution to energy flow by bottom dissipation and vegetation dissipation was observed. Our results highlight the need to scale measurements up to forest level in order to accurately quantify the impact of mangrove vegetation on wave attenuation and determine the possible impact on the protection of coastal ecosystems and infrastructure.

H.",Wave attenuation in mangroves: A quantitative approach to field observations,"Coastal mangroves, dwelling at the interface between land and sea, provide an important contribution to reducing risk from coastal hazards by attenuating incident waves and by trapping and stabilizing sediments. This paper focusses on relations between vegetation densities, wave attenuation rates, sediment characteristics and sedimentation rates in mangroves. These processes were studied along two cross-shore transects through mangroves fringing estuaries in the southern Andaman region of Thailand. Volumetric vegetation densities in these mangroves were ranging up to 32%, depending on the water depth. Generalized total wave attenuation rates increased from 0.002 m(-1) in the sparsely vegetated forest fringes with Avicennia and Sonneratia species, up to 0.012 m(-1) in the dense Rhizophora vegetation in the back of the forests. The total wave attenuation rates integrate effects of shoaling and energy losses due to various bio-physical interactions within the mangrove ecosystem. Wave attenuation in the mangroves is presumably dominated by energy losses due to vegetation drag, since wave attenuation due to bottom friction and viscous dissipation on the bare mudflats is significantly lower than those inside the mangrove vegetation. Additionally, wave attenuation in the mangroves was found to facilitate enhanced net sediment deposition and a gradual fining of the bed material. These findings corroborate the coastal defence function of mangroves by quantifying their contribution to wave attenuation and sediment trapping. The explicit linking of these properties to vegetation composition and structure facilitates modelling studies investigating the mechanisms determining the coastal defence capacities of mangroves.

From sea towards land the study area consisted of a bare mudflat, covered by a sandy layer with embryonic cheniers, abruptly changing into a muddy tidal flat overgrown with mangroves. Three instrumented tripods (A-C) placed in a cross-shore profile, were used to measure current velocity and water level, at the open tidal flat, at the beginning of the mangrove vegetation, and in the mangrove vegetation, respectively. Measurements were conducted in the wet season in July and August 2000. The elevation of the area was surveyed using a levelling instrument. Over the bare sandy surface of the mudflat, the incoming waves are reduced in height (and energy density) due to bottom friction. This reduction decreases with increasing water depth. In the mangrove vegetation, the bottom friction exerted by the clay particles is very low. However, the dense network of trunks, branches and above ground roots of the mangrove vegetation causes a much higher drag force. For the mangrove vegetation which mainly consists of Kandelia candel, the drag force can be approached by the function C-D = 0.6e(0.15A) (with A being the projected cross-sectional area of the under water obstacles at a certain water depth). For the same muddy surface without mangroves the function would be C-D = 0.6. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One popular solution to stabilize while conserving intertidal habitat is the use of living shoreline techniques which are designed to mimic natural shoreline communities by using native plants and animals. However, little information is available on the success of living shoreline stabilization. This project evaluated the wave energy attenuation associated with living shorelines that contained Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and/or Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in a wave tank. Four living shoreline techniques were assessed, including a control (sediment only), oysters alone, cordgrass alone, and a combination of oysters plus cordgrass. Time since deployment (newly deployed, one-year after deployment) was also assessed to see how wave energy attenuation changed with natural oyster recruitment and plant growth. Wave energy was calculated for each newly deployed and one-year old shoreline stabilization treatment using capacitance wave gauges and generated waves that were representative of boat wakes in Mosquito Lagoon, a shallow-water estuary in Florida. All one-year old treatments attenuated significantly more energy than newly-deployed treatments.

The test runs were carried out with monochromatic waves of height ranging from 0.08 to 0.16 m in water depths of 0.40 and 0.45 m and wave periods of 1.4-2 sec. The experimental results revealed the significant capability of vegetation in attenuating waves to the tune of 72% to 87%, and controlled flooding in terms of run-up of 0.31 to 0.76 times the wave height.

In this study, we proposed a new drag coefficient formula to account plant flexibility so that the classical theory based on rigid cylinders can be extended to predict wave decay by flexible plants. To validate this new formula, the field survey was conducted in the North Hangzhou Bay, China.

To account for the effect of submerged vegetation in wave-attenuation models, it is important to understand how the interaction between vegetation characteristics and hydrodynamic forcing affects wave attenuation. To determine the effect of vegetation characteristics, we used seagrass mimics that varied in (1) blade stiffness, (2) shoot density and (3) leaf length; to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic forcing, we studied wave attenuation in the absence and presence of a tidal current. Results show that wave attenuation is positively correlated with blade stiffness and for a given wave in shallow water, attenuation is dependent on a combination of shoot density and leaf length, which can be described by the leaf area index. The presence of a tidal current strongly reduced the wave-attenuating capacity of seagrass mimics, and this reduction was most pronounced at high shoot densities. Thus, most studies that have been carried out under waves only will structurally overestimate wave attenuation for tidal environments, emphasising that tidal currents need to be taken into account in future studies on wave attenuation by vegetation.",80,2011,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations reveal that environmental conditions including the ratio between water depth and plant height (h(r)), the ratio between wave height (H-S) and water depth, and current directions impact the wave height decay. Further, we present empirical representations of the bulk drag coefficient (C-d) as a function of the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) and Reynolds (Re) numbers, and the h(r) ratio(.) When applying the distinction between current directions, this representation exhibits better agreement when using the Re (rho(2) = 54%) and h(r) (rho(2) = 77%) than with the KC (rho(2) = 39%). Furthermore, we show that the representation of C-d can be improved by using a h(r)-based modified Re and KC formulation, yielding correlations of 76% (modified Re) and 78% (modified KC). The proposed expressions are validated during another storm and predicted H-S computed within the marsh results in a root-mean-square error of 0.014 m, overestimating the largest H-S (0.22 m) by 18%. Finally, these expressions are applied to several hypothetical sea conditions. Under similar vegetation characteristics, H-S of 1.55 and 0.8 m (close to a 10,000- and 100-year recurrence interval storm) are attenuated by 50% and 70%, respectively, at 250 m from the marsh edge.

Considerable attention has been focused on the effects of vegetation and wave conditions on wave dissipation induced by vegetation (WDV), whereas the effects of tidal current are often ignored. A series of physical experiments were performed to explore the effects of following (current direction in the same direction as waves) and opposing currents on WDV inside the rigid emergent vegetation canopy. The experimental results indicate that following currents can either enhance or suppress WDV depending on the ratio between the current velocity magnitude and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity, while opposing currents may enhance WDV more. In addition, to better understand small-scale mechanisms responsible for WDV, a quasi three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model using periodic boundary conditions was employed to extend the physical experiments to provide velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy. A direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions.

This study was designed to address the question of how effective oyster reefs are at attenuating wave energy in shallow coastal bays. Measurements were made of waves on both sides of four restored intertidal oyster reefs and at a control site with no reef; mean water depths ranged from 0.9 to 1.3m. The reefs differed in composition and position relative to the shoreline, but all had reef crest elevations between 0.3 and 0.5m below mean sea level. Differences in wave heights between the exposed/sheltered sides and upwind/downwind sides of the reefs were used to quantify the effects of the reefs on waves under varying tidal and wind conditions. All four reefs were able to reduce wave heights by an average of 30-50% for water depths of 0.5-1.0m (bracketing the heights of reef crests) and 0-20% for water depths of 1.0-1.5m (reef crests >0.25m below the water surface). For water depths greater than 1.5m, there was <10% change in wave heights. In contrast, there was no average decrease in wave height from the more seaward (exposed) to the more landward wave gauge at the control site regardless of water depth. Based on our results, we conclude that fringing oyster reefs can reduce the wave energy reaching the shoreline of marshes with edge elevations close to mean sea level. However, reefs like those in our study have little effect on waves during deeper water conditions, which allow for the largest waves, and are therefore less likely to offer protection to marshes characterized by high edge scarps and marsh surface elevations well above mean sea level.",13,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,shell reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,yes,,% wave attenuation,95CI,,,,,,,,,17.2,15120,2,125.4,,,,,17.2,15725.16,in

Liu; Chang, Che-Wei; Mei, Chiang C.",Wave Attenuation by Coastal Forest,"Coastal forests, a part of natural coastal ecosystem, have long been considered as an effective means on protecting coastal regions against wind waves, storm surges and tsunamis. To study the capability of coastal forests on dissipating incoming waves, Mei et al. (2011, 2014) introduced a theoretical approach that applies the multi-scale perturbation theory of homogenization (Mei and Vernescu 2010) to investigate the interactions of incident waves with an infinitely long forest belt. In this paper we extend the theoretical model to a coastal forest with an arbitrary shape. In general, a coastal forest can be composed of multiple forest patches of arbitrary shape as sketched in Fig. 1. A forest patch can be further divided into several subzones based on different forest properties, such as vegetation type/species, planting pattern and porosity. Therefore, a subzone can be surrounded by other subzones and/or the open water region. Each subzone is then considered as a homogeneous forest region where a constant bulk eddy viscosity is assumed. With strong contrast between the typical wavelength and tree spacing, the multi-scale perturbation method is applied to separate the micro- and macro-scale. The flow motion in a micro-scale cell, with one or more cylinders inside, can be obtained by solving the boundary-value problem numerically. The macro-scale equations governing the wave propagation are wave equations with the complex coefficients computed from the cell problem solutions. To deal with forest patches and subzones with arbitrary shape, the boundary integral equation method (Liggett and Liu 1983) is employed with all the boundaries being discretized into line elements such that the macro-scale wave dynamics can be solved numerically. Two different types of incident waves are considered. Small-amplitude periodic waves are first used to model wind waves and their interactions with coastal forest. A transient wave with a soliton-like shape is then investigated. Under. both conditions, the boundary integral formulations for a general forest subzone as well as the open water region are derived. Laboratory experiments for two special forest configurations, which were conducted at the University of Cantabria in Spain (Maza 2015), are used to validate the present model.",1,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unidirectional flows deflect the water over the meadow (skimming flows), which potentially leads to lower mixing between the water above and within the meadow. In contrast, waves cause the blades to move back and forth, increasing the exchange between the water column and that within the meadow.

Thanks to extensive national and international solidarity and support in the aftermath of the event, most people managed to restore their livelihoods completely but some households did not manage to recover completely from the impacts of the event. The differential in recovery highlighted the various vulnerabilities and coping capacities of communities exposed to the tsunami. Understanding the elements causing different vulnerabilities is crucial to reducing the impact of future events, yet capturing them comprehensively at the local level is a complex task. This research was conducted in a tsunami-affected area in southwestern Sri Lanka to evaluate firstly the role of coastal vegetation in buffering communities against the tsunami and secondly to capture the elements of vulnerability of affected communities. The area was chosen because of its complex landscape, including the presence of an inlet connecting the Maduganga estuary with the sea, and because of the presence of remaining patches of coastal vegetation. The vulnerability assessment was based on a comprehensive vulnerability framework and on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework in order to detect inherent vulnerabilities of different livelihood groups. Our study resulted in the identification of fishery and labour-led households as the most vulnerable groups. Unsurprisingly, analyses showed that damages to houses and assets decreased quickly with increasing distance from the sea. It could also be shown that the Maduganga inlet channelled the energy of the waves, so that severe damages were observed at relatively large distances from the sea. Some reports after the tsunami stated that mangroves and other coastal vegetation protected the people living behind them. Detailed mapping of the coastal vegetation in the study area and subsequent linear regression revealed significant differences between three vegetation classes present in the area with regard to water level and damages to houses.

However, few data are available to evaluate variation in carbon burial over decades to centuries, particularly in subtropical seagrass meadows. Here we assess historical trends in rates of vertical accretion and carbon burial in subtropical seagrass sediments in Moreton Bay, Australia. A total of 19 sediment cores varying in length from 22 to 205 cm were collected from six locations, including two locations where seagrass meadows occurred historically but were lost in recent decades. Cores were dated using Pb-210 and C-14. Geochronologies were modelled based on the successful Pb-210 dates for two of the locations combined with C-14 at five locations. Organic and inorganic carbon content, dry bulk density and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (delta C-13(org), delta N-15) were measured throughout the cores. Sediments underlying seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay have organic carbon stored up to a depth of at least 2 m which dates to over 7000 yr BP. Across the entire time series, organic carbon burial rates averaged 19 g m(-2) yr(-1) and inorganic carbon burial rates averaged 27 g m(-2) y(-1). Overall mean rates of vertical accretion were estimated to be 0.2 cm y(-1). Rates of vertical accretion accelerated 10-fold following European colonisation which commenced in 1824, from 0.06 +/- 0.06 cm yr(-1) to 0.66 +/- 1.19 cm y(-1). Similarly, rates of organic carbon burial averaged 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) but then increased 7-fold post-colonisation to 50.5 +/- 82.1 gm(-2) y(-1). Thus, in Moreton Bay, European settlement and associated land-use change has enhanced sediment accretion and carbon burial in seagrass sediments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While vegetation-induced wave dissipation is increasingly recognized in low wave energy environments, little is known about: (i) the effect of vegetation on wave dissipation during storms when wave heights and water levels are highest; and (ii) the ability of different plant species to dissipate waves and to maintain their integrity under storm surge conditions. Experiments undertaken in one of the world's largest wave flumes allowed, for the first time, the study of vegetation-wave interactions at near-field scale, under wave heights ranging from 0.1-0.9 m (corresponding to orbital velocities of 2-91 cm s(-1)) and water depths up to 2 m, in canopies of two typical NW European salt marsh grasses: Puccinellia maritima (Puccinellia) and Elymus athericus (Elymus). Results indicate that plant flexibility and height, as well as wave conditions and water depth, play an important role in determining how salt marsh vegetation interacts with waves. Under medium conditions (orbital velocity 42-63 cm s(-1)), the effect of Puccinellia and Elyntus on wave orbital velocities varied with water depth and wave period. Under high water levels (2 m) and long wave periods (4.1 s), within the flexible, low-growing Puccinellia canopy orbital velocity was reduced by 35% while in the more rigid, tall Elymus canopy deflection and folding of stems occurred and no significant effect on orbital velocity was found. Under low water level's (1 m) and short Wave periods (2.9 s) by contrast, Elymus reduced near-bed velocity more than Puccinelha. Under high orbital velocities (>= 74 cm s(-1)), flattening of the canopy and an increase of orbital velocity was observed for both Puccinellia and Elymus. Stem folding and breakage in Elymus at a threshold orbital velocity >= 42 cm s(-1) coincided with a levelling-off in the marsh wave dissipation capacity, while Puccinellia survived even extreme wave forces without physical damage. These findings suggest a species-specific control of wave dissipation by salt marshes which can potentially inform predictions of the wave dissipation capacity of marshes and their resilience to storm surge conditions.

However, a vegetation barrier cannot completely stop a tsunami, and its effectiveness depends on the magnitude of the tsunami as well as the structure of the vegetation. For coastal rehabilitation, optimal planning of natural coastal systems, and their maintenance, we need to quantitatively elucidate the capacity of vegetation to reduce the energy of tsunami waves. The limitations of coastal forests in relation to the magnitude of a tsunami and the maintenance of forests as natural disaster buffer zones have to be understood correctly for effective coastal vegetation planning. Demerits of coastal forests have also been revealed: for example, an open gap in a forest (i.e., a road, river, difference in elevation, etc.) can channel and amplify a strong current by forcing it into the gap. Floating debris from broken trees also can damage surrounding buildings and hurt people. However, many studies have revealed that these demerits can be overcome with proper planning and management of mangroves and coastal forests, and that coastal vegetation has a significant potential to mitigate damage in constructed areas and save human lives by acting as buffer zones during extreme natural events. However, mangrove forests have been damaged by anthropogenic activities (i.e., tourism, shrimp farming, and industrial development), making coastal areas increasingly vulnerable to tsunamis and other natural disasters. The effectiveness of vegetation also changes with the age and structure of the forest. This highlights the fact that proper planning and management of vegetation are required to maintain the tsunami buffering function of coastal forests. Although many government and nongovernmental organizations have implemented coastal vegetation projects, many of them have been unsuccessful due to a lack of proper maintenance. A pilot project in Matara City, Sri Lanka, revealed that participation and support from local authorities and communities is essential to make the planting projects successful. An integrated coastal vegetation management system that includes utilization of the materials produced by the forest and a community participation and awareness program are proposed to achieve a sustainable and long-lasting vegetation bioshield.",76,2009,WoS,,review,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,ambiguous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands and marshes, have the capacity to reduce the impacts of storm surge and coastal flooding, the increasing rate of SLR can induce the transformation and migration of these natural habitats. In this study, we combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis to evaluate the role of natural habitats in coastal flood protection. We focused on a selected cross-section of three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR) that is protected by wetlands and marshes. The coupled coastal hydrodynamic and wave models, ADCIRC+SWAN, were applied to simulate flooding from historical and synthetic storms in the Mid-Atlantic US for current and future SLR scenarios. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to project the potential migration and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due to SLR in the year 2050. Furthermore, a counterfactual land cover approach, in which marshes are converted to open water in the model, was implemented for each storm scenario in the present and the future to estimate the amount of flooding that is avoided due to the presence of natural habitats and the subsequent reduction in residential property damage. The results indicate that this salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of both the flood depth and property damage during relatively low intensity storm events, demonstrating the efficacy of natural flood protection for recurrent storm events. Monetarily, this translates to the avoidance of up to $13.1 and $32.1 million in residential property damage in the selected coastal counties during the '50-year storm' simulation and hurricane Sandy under current sea level conditions, and in the year '2050 SLR scenario', respectively.

Remote sensing made it possible to compare pre- and post-Tsunami images of large areas. A study site was selected based on medium resolution Landsat imagery and existing topographic maps. Selection criteria included substantial damages reported, presence of woody vegetated and non-vegetated shorelines, homogeneous bathymetry and good coverage of pre- and post-Tsunami satellite imagery. The Pichawaram mangrove, Tamil Nadu, India, matched these criteria. Pre- and post-Tsunami Ikonos and QuickBird images were compared through the visual interpretation of pre-Tsunami coastal vegetation and post-Tsunami damage. The results were validated in the field. The analysis showed that mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the Tsunami. This was concluded from analysing the spatial distribution of damage relative to woody vegetation along the coast as well as transects detailing the amount of damage behind the coastline and the coastal woody vegetation.",2007,2007,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an ecosystem engineering species, which is known for its wave attenuating and sediment trapping ecosystem services, but it remains unknown to which extent this is conditional. We aim to test the hypothesis that the ecosystem engineering effect concerning sediment trapping and stability by oyster reefs is conditional, and can be predicted based on i) local physical forcing, ii) morphological characteristics of the tidal flat, and iii) biological characteristics of the oyster reef. Analyses of long-term sediment accretion patterns on natural intertidal oyster reefs at the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands) showed that this ecosystem engineering effect is strongest on tidal flats under erosional conditions, lower aspect ratio (i.e., relative long and narrow reefs), relatively closed reefs (i.e., few open patches) and higher coverage of oysters within reef patches. The ability of C. gigas to shape the environment thus depends both on biotic and abiotic conditions, meaning that oyster reefs only work under specific conditions for erosion control. Overall, our results provide baseline understanding for ecosystem management aimed at affecting sediment dynamics, thereby contributing to a better understanding for designing ecosystem-based solutions under different abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, present study provides a clear example of how we need to gain a better understanding of the conditionality of ecosystem services in general, to be able to create and restore ecosystems for obtaining their services.",13,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,shell reef,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami, a post-tsunami survey was conducted along the coast in Miyagi Prefecture, which was one of the most tsunami-affected sites because rapid acceleration of the tsunami currents broke and washed away the trees, resulting in extensive damage to inland houses. In contrast, some of the houses located inland and away from vegetation with a dropping step survived. This shows a possibility that a step combined with the vegetation offers greater tsunami energy reduction by providing additional resistance. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the energy reduction through a compound defense system (vegetation and a backward-facing step). Vegetation with a step (VS) showed greater energy reduction compared to that of only vegetation without a step (OV) due to additional loss by collision with the bed surface. However, the relative energy reduction in OV remained almost constant with the increase in the initial Froude number (F-0, where the Froude number is obtained from a model without vegetation in a flume), whereas the relative energy reduction in VS showed a decreasing trend with increasing F-0 because the energy reduction due to collision decreases with increase in water depth or F-0.",13,2018,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A numerical model based on two-dimensional nonlinear long-wave equations that include drag forces and turbulence-induced shear force due to the presence of vegetation was developed to estimate tree breaking. The numerical model was then applied to a coastal forest where two dominant tropical vegetation species, Pandanus odoratissimus and Casuarina equisetifolia, were considered. The threshold water depth for tree breaking increased with increasing forest width, and the analysis was consistent with the field investigation results that the critical tsunami water depth for breaking is around 80% of the tree height for P. odoratissimus. C. equisetifolia is stronger than P. odoratissimus against tsunami action, but P. odoratissimus can reduce a greater tsunami force than C. equisetifolia due to its complex of aerial root structures. Even if breakage occurs, P. odoratissimus still has high potential to reduce the tsunami force due to its dense aerial root structures. Previous numerical models that do not include the breaking phenomena may overestimate the vegetation effect for reducing tsunami force. The combination of P. odoratissimus and C. equisetifolia is recommended as a vegetation bioshield to protect coastal areas from tsunami hazards.",27,2012,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The waves generated at the three main populated islands, Mahe, Praslin and La Digue averaged less than 2 m at the shoreline allowing assessment of effects of vegetation in mitigating impact of a low intensity tsunami event. Semi structured interviews with local witnesses of the event, field measurements of local features, as well as secondary data sources provided information on wave height at the shoreline, landscape characteristics as well as tsunami impacts inland, i.e. structural damage and maximum flood distance. Observation points at maximum flood distance and where damage occurred were geo-located and entered into a GIS. Vegetation density and resistance coefficients were determined on site and their spatial distribution through visual interpretation of Google Earth (R) pre tsunami imagery. Data was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, acknowledging the spatial distribution of data. As for Aceh, the results indicated that distance from the settlement to the shoreline was the most important factor to avoid adverse tsunami effects. In contrast to Aceh, a direct effect of coastal vegetation was not observed (p > 0.05). A significant protective effect, however, was apparent through sand dunes, stabilized by vegetation, reducing damage to buildings by up to 30% where initial water height at shoreline was 3 m. Maximum flood distance was not affected by sand dunes but was reduced (p = 0.013) by existing seawalls. A coastal planning that encompasses the promotion and protection of multi-use coastal vegetation, i.e. generating income through tourism, providing food products and protecting natural physical barriers is encouraged in order to enhance local resilience against natural wave events such as those of the 2004 tsunami.

The developed novel tree parameterization concept, accounting for both bio-mechanical and structural tree properties, allowed to substitute the complex tree structure by a simplified tree model of identical hydraulic resistance. The most representative parameterized mangrove model was selected among the tested models with different frontal area and root density, based on hydraulic test results. The selected parameterized tree models were arranged in a forest model of different width and further tested systematically under varying incident tsunami conditions (solitary waves and tsunami bores). The damping performance of the forest models under these two flow regimes was compared in terms of wave height and force envelopes, wave transmission coefficient as well as drag and inertia coefficients. Unlike the previous studies, the results indicate a significant contribution of the foreshore topography to solitary wave energy reduction through wave breaking in comparison to that attributed to the forest itself. A similar rate of tsunami transmission (ca. 20 %) was achieved for both flow conditions (solitary waves and tsunami bores) and the widest forest (75 m in prototype) investigated.

However, some mangrove forests were destroyed by that tsunami. They are expected to have lost their protective functions. In this study, we develop a fragility function to assess the mangrove trees' vulnerability, expressed as the damage probability of mangrove trees, based on field surveys and numerical modeling of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Based on the fragility function, we reconstruct a numerical model of tsunami inundation including the performance of mangrove forests in terms of reducing tsunami damage. The model reveals that a 10 year old mangrove forest in a 500 m wide area can reduce a tsunami's hydrodynamic force by approximately 70% for an incident wave of 3.0 m inundation depth and a wave period of 40 min at the shoreline. The model also shows, for a tsunami inundation depth of greater than 4 m, that a 10 year old mangrove forest would be mostly destroyed and that it would lose its force reduction capacity. Moreover, approximately 80% of a 30 year old mangrove forest would survive a 5 m tsunami and absorb 50% of the tsunami's hydrodynamic force.",37,2009,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scope This review focuses on the drivers and disturbance mechanisms (visible and functional) that tropical cyclones of various intensities have on mangrove ecosystem properties around the world, as well as the potential ecosystem services role offered by mangroves along storm-ravaged coastlines. When viewed together, studies describe repeatable types of impact and a variety of responses of mangroves that make them ecologically resilient to high velocity winds, and which have served to advance the notion that mangroves are disturbance-adapted ecosystems. Conclusions Studies have documented massive tree mortality and forest structural shifts as well as high variability of spatial effects associated with proximity and direction of the tropical cyclone trajectory that influence biogeochemical processes, recovery of individual trees, and forest regeneration and succession. Mangroves provide coastal protection through surge and wind suppression during tropical cyclones, and yet are able to overcome wind effects and often recover unless some alternative environmental stress is at play (e.g. hydrological alteration or sedimentation). Structural elements of mangroves are influenced by the legacies imposed by past tropical cyclone injury, which affect their current appearance, and presumably their function, at any point in time. However, much is yet to be discovered about the importance of the effects of tropical cyclones on these fascinating botanical ecosystems, including the role of storm-based sediment subsidies, and much more effort will be needed to predict future recovery patterns as the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones potentially change.

Nature-based flood defence has been proposed as a sustainable and effective solution to protect coastlines. However, the ability of natural ecosystems to withstand major storms like tropical hurricanes has yet to be thoroughly tested. Seagrass meadows both stabilise sediment and attenuate waves, providing effective coastal protection services for sandy beaches. To examine the tolerance of Caribbean seagrass meadows to extreme storm events, and to investigate the extent of protection they deliver to beaches, we employed a combination of field surveys, biomechanical measurements and wave modelling simulations. Field surveys of seagrass meadows before and after a direct hit by the category 5 Hurricane Irma documented that established seagrass meadows ofThalassia testudinumremained unaltered after the extreme storm event. The flexible leaves and thalli of seagrass and calcifying macroalgae inhabiting the meadows were shown to sustain the wave forces that they are likely to experience during hurricanes. In addition, the seagrass canopy and the complex biogeomorphic landscape built by the seagrass meadows combine to significantly dissipate extreme wave forces, ensuring that erosion is minimised within sandy beach foreshores. The persistence of the Caribbean seagrass meadows and their coastal protection services during extreme storm events ensures that a stable coastal ecosystem and beach foreshore is maintained in tropical regions.",2,2021,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The near-bed current, wave energy and suspended sediment concentration were much lower on the marsh than on its adjacent bare flat with the same elevation. The median grain size in Phi unit (Phi(50)) changed between 2.74 and 8.15. The bare flat sediment was mainly composed of very fine sand while the marsh sediment was dominated by silt. The organic content of the sediment was less than 3.0% and had a good correlation with sedimentary grain size. Although the sediment trapped by S. mariquete and S. triquiter amounted to 64.4mg/stem and 47.6mg/stem, their contribution to the accretion was much less than that by free settling. The annual accretion rate of the tidal marshes in the Yangtze Delta amounted to several decimeters because of the high suspended sediment concentration which was related to the great deal of riverine sediment supply.

Macrophyte production was higher and root:shoot ratios lower in dredged material marshes. Measured vertical accretion was similar in dredged material (7.4 +/- 0.6 mm y(-1)) and sand (6.4 +/- 0.9 mm y(-1)) marshes, and is keeping pace with local sea-level rise. A detailed carbon budget was developed for one dredged material marsh to examine carbon dynamics under high nutrient availability. High annual macrophyte production combined with small exports via tidal exchange and methane emissions resulted in an annual carbon burial of 206 g C m(-2) y(-1), and calculated vertical accretion of 6.5 mm y(-1) from organic matter. This is attributed to the contribution of organic matter from aboveground biomass due to protection from perimeter dikes constructed to contain dredged material during placement, reducing marsh exposure and organic matter export.

Vegetative source and sink terms are added to the transport equations of the Mellor-Yamada turbulence closure model in order to properly simulate the vertical mixing process that takes place within vegetated water columns. The model adopts two well-established empirical formulas to determine the vegetation drag coefficient. Although these formulas have been established under laboratory conditions that differ from those tested in the present study, quantitative and qualitative comparisons reveal the satisfactory performance of the enhanced model to simulate complex flow-vegetation interactions. Model validation against laboratory experiments show that the vegetation-induced drag force added to the momentum equations is the main contributor to the flow-vegetation interactions. The original model that lumps the resistance due to vegetation with the bottom roughness coefficient produces locally incorrect vertical distributions of mean flow velocity and turbulence quantities. The enhanced model is applied to simulate the impacts of intertidal salt marshes of Jamaica Bay, NY, on the storm tide produced by Hurricane Irene. The model results indicate that the salt marshes played only a minimal role in mitigating the peak water elevations induced by Irene. On the other hand, the presence of the marshes causes higher velocities in non vegetated areas such as deep channels, and lower velocities in vegetated areas, and thus redistributes energy around the bay, with likely feedbacks on water quality, marsh stability, and the response to sea level rise.

Existing models based on Rayleigh distribution of wave heights are critically examined followed by the development of two new models for random waves over vegetation. The first model is derived on the basis of Hasselmann and Collins' treatment of energy dissipation of random waves attributable to the bottom friction. The second model is derived on the basis of Longuet-Higgins' probability density function for the joint distribution of wave heights and wave periods, which recovers to the model that uses the Rayleigh distribution of wave heights if the spectrum becomes narrow banded. Such a model allows for quantifying the effects of the spectral width on the model performances. Comparisons of the modeled and measured root-mean-square wave heights over vegetation show good agreement. Moreover, the Joint distribution-based model provides insight into the spectral distribution of the energy dissipation, which is different from other dissipation models that follow exactly the wave energy spectrum.

Since then,S. apetalahas replaced nativeA. corniculatumas the leading choice for reforestation because faster growth was considered to result in a higher accretion. The aim of this work was to test the hypotheses that the surface accretion was significantly higher under alienS. apetalathan under indigenousA. corniculatumplantation and that accretion under older communities were significantly higher than those under younger communities. We established four field sites: a 14-year-oldS. apetalacommunity (14Sa), a 14-year-oldA. corniculatumcommunity (14Ac), an 8-year-oldS. apetalacommunity (8Sa) and an 8-year-oldA. corniculatumcommunity (8Ac). The vertical accretion was monitored under these communities, and the height and basal diameter of individual pneumatophores as well as the canopy and height of each seedling were measured, and the total volume of above ground barriers (V-M) was calculated. The results from a 2-year observation period (January 2015 to December 2016) showed that (1) 14Sa had significantly higher vertical accretion than 14Ac, but a significant difference was not observed between 8Sa and 8Ac; (2) the accretion under 14Sa and 14Ac were significantly higher than those under 8Sa and 8Ac; and (3) the accretion were affected by the total volume of above ground barriers (V-M) under mangroves.

Evidence that coastal wetlands reduce storm surge and attenuate waves is often cited in support of restoring Gulf Coast wetlands to protect coastal communities and property from hurricane damage. Yet interdisciplinary studies combining hydrodynamic and economic analysis to explore this relationship for temperate marshes in the Gulf are lacking. By combining hydrodynamic analysis of simulated hurricane storm surges and economic valuation of expected property damages, we show that the presence of coastal marshes and their vegetation has a demonstrable effect on reducing storm surge levels, thus generating significant values in terms of protecting property in southeast Louisiana. Simulations for four storms along a sea to land transect show that surge levels decline with wetland continuity and vegetation roughness. Regressions confirm that wetland continuity and vegetation along the transect are effective in reducing storm surge levels. A 0.1 increase in wetland continuity per meter reduces property damages for the average affected area analyzed in southeast Louisiana, which includes New Orleans, by $99-$133, and a 0.001 increase in vegetation roughness decreases damages by $24-$43.

We examine the effects of wetlands on cyclone damage by creating a Bayesian regression model for storm damage as a function of wind speed, economic development in the storm swath, and the area of wetlands in the coastal plain in the storm swath using data from all 54 storms. Our results show that wind speed has a strong positive effect on cyclone damage and that wetland area has a strong negative effect. We estimate a total of AUD 29.6 billion of damage was averted during the 54 storms because of the presence of wetlands with a median of AUD 236 million per storm.

This work provides some direct evidence that declined coral reefs would weaken their functions to maintain a stable coastline, resulting in severe coastal erosion.

Research suggests that certain factors that affect economic damages are increasing the vulnerability of coastal communities. Population growth, which increases vulnerability by placing valuable lives and assets in the path of storms, is expected to increase. Climate change has the potential to cause more frequent and intense storms, and coastal wetland loss is contributing to the vulnerability of coastal populations. Wetlands conservation and restoration is often advocated for as a means of reducing the impacts of coastal storms. The relationship between wetlands and storm surge energy is understood relatively well in physical terms, but very little economic analysis has been conducted to estimate the degree to which wetlands reduce economic impacts. Using factor analysis, the relationships among coastal populations, wetlands, storm intensity, and economic damage are explored. The factor analysis suggests that wetland presence is associated with a reduction in economic damages from coastal storms. Factor score analysis suggests that the proportion of damage explained by wetland presence is smaller for more intense storms. These results are consistent with those found in the physical science literature and have potentially large consequences for how wetlands are used in risk reduction.",3,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reefs dissipate around 90% of the incident wave energy through wave breaking, whereas sand dunes provide the final natural barrier against coastal flooding. The storm impact on coastal areas with these features depends on the relative elevation of the extreme water levels with respect to the sand dune morphology. However, despite the importance of barrier reefs and dunes in coastal protection, poor management practices have degraded these ecosystems, increasing their vulnerability to coastal flooding. The present study aims to theoretically investigate the role of the reef-dune system in coastal protection under current climatic conditions at Puerto Morelos, located in the Mexican Caribbean Sea, using a widely validated nonlinear non-hydrostatic numerical model (SWASH). Wave hindcast information, tidal level, and a measured beach profile of the reef-dune system in Puerto Morelos are employed to estimate extreme runup and the storm impact scale for current and theoretical scenarios. The numerical results show the importance of including the storm surge when predicting extreme water levels and also show that ecosystem degradation has important implications for coastal protection against storms with return periods of less than 10 years. The latter highlights the importance of conservation of the system as a mitigation measure to decrease coastal vulnerability and infrastructure losses in coastal areas in the short to medium term. Furthermore, the results are used to evaluate the applicability of runup parameterisations for beaches to reef environments. Numerical analysis of runup dynamics suggests that runup parameterisations for reef environments can be improved by including the fore reef slope. Therefore, future research to develop runup parameterisations incorporating reef geometry features (e.g. reef crest elevation, reef lagoon width, fore reef slope) is warranted.",7,2018,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,dune,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seagrasses are the largest submerged aquatic vegetation ecosystem protected in Europe and it is worth examining their contribution to coastal protection. The review performed highlights incident energy flux, density, standing biomass and plant stiffness as the main physical and biological factors influencing the efficiency of the protection provided by seagrasses. The main conclusion achieved is that seagrass meadows cannot protect shorelines in every location and/or scenario. The optimal conditions for enhancing the protection supplied might be achieved in shallow waters and low wave energy environments, with high interaction surface, at the vertical and horizontal dimension, between water flow and seagrasses. Likewise, the most favorable protection might be provided by large, long living and slow growing seagrass species, with biomass being largely independent of seasonal fluctuations and with the maximum standing biomass reached under the highest hydrodynamic forcings. It is shown that seawater warming, increasing storms and sea level rise, together with the increasing population and anthropogenic threats in the coastal area may lead to rates of change too fast to allow seagrasses to adapt and keep their coastal defense service. Finally, to amend the decline of seagrasses and consequent coastal protection loss, different artificial and natural adaptation measures are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This review is focused on NBI approaches to improve coastal resilience in the face of extreme storm events, including hurricanes. We not only consider the role of NBI as a measure to protect people and property but also in the context of other ecological goods and services provided by tidal wetlands including production of fish and shellfish. Although the results of many studies suggest that populated areas protected by coastal marshes were less likely to experience damage when exposed to the full force of storm surge, it was absolutely critical to place the role of coastal wetlands into perspective by noting that while tidal marshes can reduce wave energy from low-to-moderate-energy storms, their capacity to substantially reduce storm surge remains poorly quantified. Moreover, although tidal marshes can reduce storm surge from fast moving storms, very large expanses of habitat are needed to be most effective, and for most urban settings, there is insufficient space to rely on nature based risk reduction strategies alone. The success of a given NBI method is also context dependent on local conditions, with,potentially confounding influences from substrate characteristics, topography, near shore bathymetry, distance from the shore and other physical factors and human drivers such as development patterns. Furthermore, it is important to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of newly developed NBI projects through rigorous evaluations and characterize the local specificities of the particular built and natural environments surrounding these coastal areas. In order for the relevant science to better inform policy, and assist in land-use challenges, scientists must clearly state the likelihood of success in a particular circumstance and set of conditions. We conclude that caution is advised before selecting a particular NBI method as there is no one size fits all solution to address site specific conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The surge amplitude decreases at a rate of 40-50 cm/km across the mangrove forest and at a rate of 20 cm/km across the areas with a mixture of mangrove islands with open water. In contrast, the amplitudes of storm surges at the front of the mangrove zone increase by about 10-30% because of the blockage of mangroves to surge water, which can cause greater impacts on structures at the front of mangroves than the case without mangroves. The mangrove forest can also protect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone against surge inundation from a Category 5 hurricane with a fast forward speed of 11.2 m/s (25 mph). However, the forest cannot fully attenuate storm surges from a Category 5 hurricane with a slow forward speed of 2.2 m/s (5 mph) and reduced surges can still affect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone. The effects of widths of mangrove zones on reducing surge amplitudes are nonlinear with large reduction rates (15-30%) for initial width increments and small rates (<5%) for subsequent width increments.

Its pronounced morphologic features protect coastal recreation facilities located behind the reef. To provide a basis for evaluating the role of the fringing coral reef in protecting marinas and sandy beaches against waves and currents, a two-dimensional (2D) numerical model ""SIMulating Wastal PROcess"" (SIMCOPRO) was applied with its three main modules including wave, current and sediment. The selected study area is located at Sahl Hasheesh coast south of Hurghada on the west coast of the Red Sea at a site proposed for the construction of a marina. The model offers insight in how the reef system modifies the wave and current fields. The application of the model in the presence of a marina reveals insignificant erosion on the downdrift side of the marina breakwaters (south of the southern breakwater). The erosion is expected to be 1 m after the first year, 2 m after the next 5 years and no further change for a period of 10 years. This is because the rocky reefal beachface will be exposed and erosion of sand will be diminished. The minor local erosion is controlled by the protective response of coral reef, the very limited coarse sand on the beachface ( < 0.5 m thick), the weak current induced by waves (0.13 m/s) and other topographic protective elements in the region. The submerged/emerged geometric nature of the reefal system, both reef flat and reef crest, allow wave dissipation and thus behaves as a submerged breakwater to protect marinas or artificial beaches in the shelter zone of this reef. An important lesson to be learned from this study is that improper construction practices of building marinas can seriously hurt the environment. The dredging of artificial reef lagoons is one improper practice that would create unexpected beach erosion. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems act as natural defenses against coastal hazards, but their degradation increases risk to people and property. Environmental degradation, however, has rarely been quantified as a driver of coastal risk. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, a region on the Mexican Caribbean coast with an annual tourism economy of 10 billion USD, coral reefs constitute a natural barrier against flooding from hurricanes. This study spatially quantifies the risk reduction benefits of the Mesoamerican Reef in Quintana Roo for people, buildings, and hotel infrastructure. The risk reduction benefits are substantial. For example, the reefs prevented 43% additional damage during Hurricane Dean in (2007) and provide nowadays hazard risk reduction for 4.3% of the people, 1.9% of the built capital, and 2.4% of the hotel infrastructure, per year. The annual benefits are estimated in 4,600 people, 42 million USD damage prevention for buildings, and 20.8 million USD for hotel infrastructure. The study also compares the risk reduction of coral reefs with (i) the protection offered by dunes and (ii) the increase in coastal risk from sealevel rise (SLR). The risk reduction of dunes is more critical where there are no coral reefs offshore and for small return-periods storms. Sea-level rise, however, will make the more frequent storms more impactful and will drive significant increases in annual expected damages across the region. However, we demonstrate that, in coral reef environments, the contribution of reef degradation to coastal risk is larger than the expected increase in risk from SLR. However, the spatial distribution of the risk reduction benefits from reefs differs for people and infrastructure, and in particular for hotels, which receive the most protection from reefs. Furthermore, many sections present larger benefits than the typical costs of restoration. This valuation makes a compelling case for protecting and maintaining this natural infrastructure for its risk reduction service, but also allows the development of piloting innovative strategies, such as risk finance and insurance strategies, that can align environmental and risk management goals.",7,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to understand the effects of fringe mangroves on erosion and sediment dynamics and of wave exposure on seedling density at three sites of increasing wave energy. Sediment properties (mean grain size, sorting, and bulk density) were assessed within each site in unvegetated and mangrove-vegetated shores in wet and dry seasons. In addition, we estimated seasonal erosion/accretion rates for 2.4 years and seedling density in two zones from the forest edge with contrasting wave exposure. Regression analysis was carried out to explain sediment properties and erosion rate variance in response to the vegetation volume that opposes wave energy and to explain erosion rates in response to wave energy. Mangrove-vegetated shores reduced erosion rates from 3 to 15 times in the two sites with higher wave energy, while the vegetated site with the lowest wave energy experienced accretion compared to minor erosion along the unvegetated shore. Shores with greater Rhizophora mangle basal areas and vegetation volumes favored deposition of particles with low settling rates, different sediment classes, reduced erosion rates, and increased shoreline stability. Mangrove seedling density decreased between 2 and 43 times from the low wave exposure zone to the high wave exposure zone at the forest edge in studied sites. In order to increase vegetation volume, coastal adaptation based on mangroves must limit human disturbances and facilitate epiphytic relationships with oysters.",5,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peter; Lapetina, Andrew; Ma, Gangfeng",The reduction of storm surge by vegetation canopies: Three-dimensional simulations,"Significant buffering of storm surges by vegetation canopies has been suggested by limited observations and simple numerical studies, particularly following recent Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Here we simulate storm surge and inundation over idealized topographies using a three-dimensional vegetation-resolving storm surge model coupled to a shallow water wave model and show that a sufficiently wide and tall vegetation canopy reduces inundation on land by 5 to 40 percent, depending upon various storm and canopy parameters. Effectiveness of the vegetation in dissipating storm surge and inundation depends on the intensity and forward speed of the hurricane, as well as the density, height, and width of the vegetation canopy. Reducing the threat to coastal vegetation from development, sea level rise, and other anthropogenic factors would help to protect many coastal regions against storm surges. Citation: Sheng, Y. P., A.

Comparing pre- and post-tsunami satellite imagery of the study area, we found that approximately 70% of the mangrove forest was destroyed by the tsunami. Based on field observations, we found that the survival rate of mangroves increased with increasing stem diameter. Specifically, we found that 72% of Rhizophora trees with a 25-30 cm stem diameter survived the tsunami impact, whereas only 19% with a 15-20 cm stem diameter survived. We simulated the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami using the nonlinear shallow-water wave theory to reproduce the tsunami inundation flow and investigated the bending moment acting on the mangrove trees. Results of the numerical model showed that the tsunami inundated areas along the mangrove creeks, and its current velocity reached 5.0 m s(-1). Based on the field measurements and numerical results, we proposed a fragility function for mangroves, which is the relationship between the probability of damage and the bending stress caused by the maximum bending moment. We refined the numerical model to include the damage probability of mangrove forests using the obtained fragility function to investigate the tsunami reduction effect of mangrove forest. Under simple numerical conditions related to the mangrove forest, ground level, and incident wave, the model showed that a mangrove forest of Rhizophora sp. with a density of 0.2 trees m(-2) and a stem diameter of 15 cm in a 400 m wide area can reduce the tsunami inundation depth by 30% when the incident wave is assumed to have a 3.0 m inundation depth and a wave period of 30 min at the shoreline. However, 50% of the mangrove forest is destroyed by a 4.5 m tsunami inundation depth, and most of the mangrove forest is destroyed by a tsunami inundation depth greater than 6 m. The reduction effect of tsunami inundation depth decreased when the tsunami inundation depth exceeded 3 m, and was mostly lost when the tsunami inundation depth exceeded 6 m. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This extreme weather event presented an excellent opportunity to assess the effectiveness of tidal salt marshes and maritime forests in buffering adjacent development from storm-related damage. To address this question of how well did or under what conditions did coastal ecosystems buffer adjacent human development, we undertook to quantify the incremental monetary value that a hectare or linear extent of fronting salt marsh and/or maritime forest had on protecting the built environment of the back-bay communities in the Barnegat Bay region of New Jersey, USA. Statistical modeling was used to estimate the relationship between the spatial extent and characteristics of fronting coastal wetlands with the various damage metrics derived from the Federal Emergency Management Agency National Flood Insurance Program payout and Preliminary Property Modeling Task Force damage data at the scale of the individual housing unit. While salt marshes may be effective in diminishing wave energies and buffering adjacent development under normal conditions, in the case of SuperStorrn Sandy, we find no evidence that New Jersey's extensive coastal marshes significantly buffered and thereby reduced NFIP payouts on the majority of back-bay residential properties. The extreme conditions of this storm event with storm surges upwards of 2 m, effectively flooded these marshes diminishing their protective capacity. The bulk of the residential properties damaged in our study area were located in lagoonal communities that are built directly adjacent to tidal water and are thereby highly vulnerable to storm surge-related flooding whether or not they are buffered by adjacent marshes. The results of this study should not be misconstrued in concluding that salt marshes do not have a positive value in protecting coastal properties; rather, their protective buffering capacity for extreme storm events is limited and that lagoonal-style developments remain highly vulnerable to sea level rise and future storms.",1,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Degraded reefs will be unable to maintain sufficient vertical accretion with substantial increases in sea level, which will alter the hydrodynamics of these systems. A reduction in wave dissipation by reefs has the potential to shift the shorelines behind the reefs, potentially resulting in economic and habitat losses for tropical shorelines. This study focused on a barrier reef with low, live coral cover (<10%) and accretion rates comparable to current rates of sea-level rise in the region ( similar to 1.7 mm/y). Tides served as a proxy for sea-level rise, with the spring high tide representing a future low tide. These findings indicate that at low tide, infragravity wave frequencies (0.004-0.04 Hz) dominate in the lagoon and are a function of wave breaking on the reef. At high tide, the infragravity waves are less prominent. Current velocities were higher at high tide, averaging 0.14 m s(-1) vs. 0.11 m s(-1) at low tide. The spectral current characteristics correlate with the infragravity wave frequencies and suggest that these waves are a driving force in lagoon circulation. Wave-energy transmission increased at high tide by 20-30% throughout the sampling period. These results suggest that with sea-level rise, infragravity band waves will be reduced and affect the stresses on the sea bed and sediment-transport processes, also allowing larger and more energetic waves to reach the shoreline.",1,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective mitigation of such disasters is possible via healthy coastal forests, which can reduce the energy of tsunamis. In recent years, these natural barriers have declined due to adverse human and natural activities. In the past 20 years, the world has lost almost 50 per cent of its mangrove forests, making them one of the most endangered landscapes.

Here, we demonstrate that embedding realism in model vegetation, in the form of buoyancy and flexibility, can profoundly impact the structure of the flow and rates of vertical mixing in wave-dominated conditions. A laboratory investigation was undertaken with two types of model canopy: (1) rigid canopies consisting of wooden dowels, and (2) flexible, buoyant model plants designed to mimic meadows of the seagrass Posidonia australis. To isolate the impact of flexibility, the maximum heights and frontal areas of the two types of canopy were matched. These canopies were subjected to oscillatory flows with a realistic range of wave heights and periods. Drag reduction caused by the reconfiguration of flexible canopies leads to a greatly diminished velocity attenuation in the canopy (by, on average, 65%). The reduced average height of flexible canopies shifts the canopy shear layer toward the bed, resulting in significantly enhanced levels of near-bed turbulence. Finally, a decreased vertical diffusivity (by approximately 35%) was observed in the flexible model canopies, relative to the rigid analogues. Thus, while the use of dynamically scaled vegetation adds complexity to modeling efforts, it represents a step toward a more accurate quantitative understanding of flow and mixing in these environments.",13,2018,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elaborated by the Ministry of Environment (Brasil, 2016) this plan intends to reduce the national vulnerability due to climate changes and the implementation of risk management associated to this phenomenon. This Plan gives special attention to the coastal zones of the country. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), the Coastal Zone is subject to the impact of high-energy meteorological events during autumn and winter period. Storm surges and floods are common during and after the passage of these events, putting people, infrastructure and ecosystems in danger. The foredunes constitute the continent's first line of natural defense against the ocean's floods and coastal erosion. Therefore, the present study applies the Dune Erosion Rule's model in order to quantify the foredunes' erosion on the south shoreline of Rio Grande do Sal State (RS). This application seeks to validate the model for the beaches of RS. The performed characterization of the erosion process was based on the Storm Impact Scale, categorizing the analyzed events within four categories. The dune erosion model had shown high values of dune erosion due to the configuration of the used parameters, which must be modified in order to improve its applicability on the shoreline of RS. The combined application of these two models has relevant potential for direct use in the management of coastal ecosystems, since after being properly adapted to the local scale, it infers in the necessary dimensions and characteristics so that the foredunes can effectively fulfill the function of coastal protection.",0,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,dune,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have focused on studying the reduction of wave height in a mangrove forest. However, the understanding of this attenuation process is still in its infancy. In order to obtain more insight, a laboratory experiment, mimicking the processes of wave attenuation by coastal mangroves in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam was conducted. The reduction of wave height for different scenarios of mangrove densities and wave conditions was investigated. A new method to quantify vegetation attenuation induced by vegetation is presented. The wave height reduction is presented over a relative length scale (viz. the number of wavelengths), instead of an absolute length scale of the forest (e.g per meter or per 100 m). The effects of wave non-linearity on the wave height attenuation over the mangrove forest were investigated using the Ursell number. It is suggested that the non-linear character of waves has a strong influence on the attenuation of the waves inside the mangrove forest. A numerical model, mimicking the experiment was constructed in SWASH and validated using the experimental data. Finally, the data set was extended through numerical modelling so that a larger ranging relationship between wave attenuation per wave length and the Ursell number could be formulated.",10,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding the quantitative economic benefits of such services, particularly for coastal vegetated dune ecosystems. A novel geographic information system (GIS)-based technique for delineating, quantifying, and relating coastal dune volume, vegetation area, and geographic and built-environment covariates to sustained property damage was used for the upper Texas coast following Hurricane Ike in 2008. The multivariate regression analysis contained more than 1000 homes spanning both sides of the storm's path. Dune volume and vegetation were both significantly related to reduced sustained property damage for the west side of the storm. For this area, model results showed that dune sediment was worth roughly $50 per cubic meter and dune vegetation was worth roughly $140 per square meter. However, because these variables were collinear and modeled separately, these amounts should not be viewed additively. The total property damage offset value of dunes across the study area was estimated to be more than $8 million, or approximately $8200 per homeowner. Based on the frequency of storms for this area over the last 115 years, coastal vegetated dunes were valued at roughly $86,000 per hectare per year. The results indicate that dunes could play an integral role in coastal hazard mitigation strategies and offer a unique opportunity where bioengineered, green infrastructure can be used as an alternative to hard coastal structures.",15,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,dune,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of surface elevation to change synchronously with rising sea level is the key to the survival of mangroves. Mangrove vegetation can have a variety of effects on surface and subsurface processes; therefore, it has an important role in surface elevation changes. In this study, rod surface elevation table marker horizon (RSET-MII) technology was used to study changes in surface elevation and accretion between nonvegetated and vegetated mangrove areas at three different sites. The results showed that the existence of vegetation had a significant effect on elevation changes, with increased surface elevation in vegetation areas observed to be significantly greater than those in nonvegetation areas. In addition, the subsurface changes in vegetated area showed expansion, whereas the nonvegetation area showed subsidence. Surface accretion showed variable trends in different research sites, although these could he related to their geographical location and thus he affected by many factors. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between density of vegetation and elevation/subsurface changes (r = 0.763, p < 0.05; r = 0.714, p < 0.05 respectively), and there were no significant correlations between accretion and vegetation characteristics. The results indicate that mangrove vegetation has a positive effect on the increase of surface elevation, and vegetation density may be a key factor because of the high biomass and carbon storage rate in high density areas. This study provides additional data with which to explore the elevation variation in mangroves and a scientific basis and technical support for strengthening wetland protection.",0,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been determined that vegetation affects wave characteristics and cause wave attenuation especially in shallow waters where wave orbitals are in interaction with vegetation. Consequently they affect sediment deposition and resuspension acting as a sink. The aim of this study is to determine wave attenuation due to vegetation, and to identify the effect of emergent vegetation on suspended sediment concentration. In this experimental study, a reed bed was established on a sandy bottom in a wave flume in ITU Hydraulics Laboratory. Regular waves with different wave steepness were generated in the flume and water surface elevations through the reed bed were measured using resistance type wave gauges. Suspended sediment concentration time series were measured using OPCON along depth. The gradual wave attenuation due to reed bed was determined and wave transmission coefficients for different waves were found between 0.35 and 0.55 and these values are reversely proportional with wave steepness. It has been found out that wave attenuation also decreases with increasing KC numbers. Suspended sediment concentration measurements inside the reed bed were a little bit harder to interpret, but a decrease in concentration; before the waves reach the reed bed and after the waves left the reed bed, was determined. In spite of many studies on effects of vegetation on flow conditions there is still a lack of understanding vegetation-flow interaction and sedimentation around them.

It is known that coastal vegetation affects wave properties, and studies regarding this topic have been made in a wide variety, mostly focusing on wave attenuation. In this study, laboratory experiments have been conducted in a wave basin to inspect the effect of an emergent vegetation on wave attenuation, wave transformation and wave kinematics. A blank area is present along the reed field, which enables energy transformation during wave propagation. Three different regular waves have been sent to a natural reed field, and wave heights and kinematics have been measured around the structure. The results indicate that crest-parallel energy transmission takes place as the waves propagate along the reed field, which is boosted at the end of the reed, and the transmission becomes faster on waves with higher wave steepness. Measured water particle velocities have been evaluated to obtain the steady-cyclic and fluctuation components, by which, turbulence intensities in front and at the wake of the reed field have been evaluated. The results indicate that turbulence intensity increases at the mid-depth at the wake of the structure, becoming higher with increasing wave steepness. Thus, one may conclude that energy dissipation takes further place after the end of the reed field due to turbulence.",5,2013,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parameterizations of wave breaking and bottom friction developed for sandy beaches are found to represent the observed decay in wave energy with an increased friction coefficient. These parameterizations are incorporated into the one-dimensional energy flux balance, which is integrated across the reef to assess the effects of varying tidal range, incident wave height and reef bathymetry on the sea and swell band wave height and wave setup near the shoreline. Wave energy on the reef is strongly depth-limited and controlled by the reef submergence level. Shoreline wave energy increases with incident wave height largely due to the increase in water level from breaking wave setup. Increased tidal levels result in increased shoreline energy, since wave setup is only weakly reduced.

Field surveys of a shallow Florida Bay seagrass meadow highlighted a more diverse benthic landscape. Although dominated by Thalassia testudinum, the communities were distinctly multispecific, composed of a mixture of both plant and algal species. Strap-like seagrass elements defined the upper portion of these canopies (the upperstory) while broad-bodied algal species were found concentrated close to the bed (the understory). To predict the hydrodynamic implications of this dual-story canopy structure, we derived a new canopy flow attenuation model, formulated to account for vertical canopy heterogeneities like those seen at our field site. The model was validated through a series of laboratory experiments: multispecific canopy mimics were installed in a current-wave flume and exposed to a range of unidirectional and oscillatory flows. Mean and fluctuating velocity was measured above and within each canopy to determine vegetation-induced flow attenuation. Velocities near the bed were markedly reduced through the addition of understory elements, results that were consistent with model predictions. These findings suggest that accurate prediction of flow-regulated processes like sediment transport and propagule dissemination depends on a thorough accounting of community composition.

This event has stimulated a debate about the role played by coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests and coral reefs in protecting low-lying coastal areas. While some observers claim that these ecosystems play an important role, others are more sceptical and fear that financial resources may be diverted away from tsunami preparedness programmes to ecosystem rehabilitation schemes. Here, we review the role of coastal ecosystems in mitigating sea wave hazards. In particular, we examine the influence of coastal vegetation in severely affected parts of Aceh and Southern Thailand during the 2004 tsunami, and include direct observations made during two field visits in 2006. Numerous scientific studies illustrate that coastal ecosystems are important in protecting the coast against normal and extreme wind-driven waves, including cyclonic storm surges. However, much less information is available concerning the role of coastal ecosystems in protecting against tsunamis, and most studies have been too limited in scope to be able to generalise over large geographic areas and diverse conditions. In particular, few studies have taken account of the high variability in the energy and speed of tsunami waves along different coastline stretches, making it difficult to compare the role of ecosystems in different regions. Other aspects that have been little studied include the spatial patterns of impact, e.g. flow diversion and channelling as a result of hydraulic resistance, and the effects of tree breaking and flow debris. However, despite these limitations, some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the protection provided by ecosystems against tsunami waves: (1) The most important predictor variables of the tsunami hazard (i.e. set-up and inundation) at the regional and landscape levels are distance to the tsunami source and coastal topography, in particular near-shore bathymetry. (2) The influence of coral reefs on tsunami waves is complex. While closed, intact reefs can provide some protection, water may be accelerated through channels in fragmented reefs, causing even greater destruction on land. (3) In contrast, seagrass beds appear to provide a more consistent buffering against tsunamis, though more data are needed to quantify this effect. (4) In several locations (particularly farther away from the tsunami source), mangroves and other vegetation probably provided some protection against the 2004 tsunami; in numerous other locations, however, vegetation provided no protection or may in some cases even have increased the hazard (e.g. by contributing to flow debris, or by channelling water flows). It seems that whether or not vegetation does provide protection depends on many factors, including stand size, density, species composition, structure and homogeneity. Overall, the value of vegetation as a potential tsunami buffer is probably fairly minor, though it cannot be completely dismissed. Many more detailed spatial and hydro-dynamic analyses are needed before the hazard-vegetation interactions can be realistically modelled and visualised, e.g. on risk maps. (5) Tsunami greenbelts should not be treated as alternatives to early warning systems. Greenbelts may only be considered as an economical (and multi-functional) means to provide relative hazard protection for material assets (e.g. infrastructure, agriculture). We recommend a more holistic view, with tsunami hazard mitigation being seen as one of several services provided by coastal ecosystems. Equally, the value of other ecosystem services may be seen within the frame of risk management as they foster social stability and, in case of disaster, robustness.

This event has stimulated a debate about the role played by coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests and coral reefs in protecting low-lying coastal areas. While some observers claim that these ecosystems play an important role, others are more sceptical and fear that financial resources may be diverted away from tsunami preparedness programmes to ecosystem rehabilitation schemes. Here, we review the role of coastal ecosystems in mitigating sea wave hazards. In particular, we examine the influence of coastal vegetation in severely affected parts of Aceh and Southern Thailand during the 2004 tsunami, and include direct observations made during two field visits in 2006. Numerous scientific studies illustrate that coastal ecosystems are important in protecting the coast against normal and extreme wind-driven waves, including cyclonic storm surges. However, much less information is available concerning the role of coastal ecosystems in protecting against tsunamis, and most studies have been too limited in scope to be able to generalise over large geographic areas and diverse conditions. In particular, few studies have taken account of the high variability in the energy and speed of tsunami waves along different coastline stretches, making it difficult to compare the role of ecosystems in different regions. Other aspects that have been little studied include the spatial patterns of impact, e.g. flow diversion and channelling as a result of hydraulic resistance, and the effects of tree breaking and flow debris. However, despite these limitations, some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the protection provided by ecosystems against tsunami waves: (1) The most important predictor variables of the tsunami hazard (i.e. set-up and inundation) at the regional and landscape levels are distance to the tsunami source and coastal topography, in particular near-shore bathymetry. (2) The influence of coral reefs on tsunami waves is complex. While closed, intact reefs can provide some protection, water may be accelerated through channels in fragmented reefs, causing even greater destruction on land. (3) In contrast, seagrass beds appear to provide a more consistent buffering against tsunamis, though more data are needed to quantify this effect. (4) In several locations (particularly farther away from the tsunami source), mangroves and other vegetation probably provided some protection against the 2004 tsunami; in numerous other locations, however, vegetation provided no protection or may in some cases even have increased the hazard (e.g. by contributing to flow debris, or by channelling water flows). It seems that whether or not vegetation does provide protection depends on many factors, including stand size, density, species composition, structure and homogeneity. Overall, the value of vegetation as a potential tsunami buffer is probably fairly minor, though it cannot be completely dismissed. Many more detailed spatial and hydro-dynamic analyses are needed before the hazard-vegetation interactions can be realistically modelled and visualised, e.g. on risk maps. (5) Tsunami greenbelts should not be treated as alternatives to early warning systems. Greenbelts may only be considered as an economical (and multi-functional) means to provide relative hazard protection for material assets (e.g. infrastructure, agriculture). We recommend a more holistic view, with tsunami hazard mitigation being seen as one of several services provided by coastal ecosystems. Equally, the value of other ecosystem services may be seen within the frame of risk management as they foster social stability and, in case of disaster, robustness. To assess the overall value of these services and to develop more accurate indicators of risk will require much more transdisciplinary research. (C) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

The Pb-210 Constant Rate of Supply model was applied to six soil cores to calculate annual rates over the most recent 10, 50, and 100 year time spans. Our results show that rates integrated over longer timeframes are lower than those for shorter, recent periods of observation. Additionally, the substantial spatial variability between cores over the 10 year period is diminished over the 100 year record, raising two important implications. First, a multiple-decade assessment of soil accretion and OC burial provides a more conservative estimate and is likely to be most relevant for forecasting these rates relative to long-term processes of sea level rise and climate change mitigation. Second, a small number of sampling locations are better able to account for spatial variability over the longer periods than for the shorter periods. The site average 100year OC burial rate, 12319 (standard deviation) g m(-2)yr(-1), is low compared with global mangrove values. High TN and TP burial rates in recent decades may lead to increased soil carbon remineralization, contributing to the low carbon burial rates. Finally, the strong correlation between OC burial and accretion across this site signals the substantial contribution of OC to soil building in addition to the ecosystem service of CO2 sequestration.",55,2014,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have a special role in supporting fisheries and in the stabilizing the tropical coastal zones. Biochemical and trophodynamic processes in the mangroves are strongly linked to water movement, due to tides and waves. In this paper we present the theoretical attempt to predict the attenuation of wind-induced random surface waves in the mangrove forest. The energy dissipation in the frequency domain is determined by treating the mangrove forest as a random media with certain characteristics determined using the geometry of mangrove trunks and their locations. Initial nonlinear governing equations are linearized using the concept of minimalization in the stochastic sense and interactions between mangrove trunks and roots have been introduced through the modification of the drag coefficients. The resulting rate of wave energy attenuation depends strongly on the density of the mangrove forest, diameter of mangrove roots and trunks, and on the spectral characteristics of the incident waves. Examples of numerical calculations as well as preliminary results from observation of wave attenuation through mangrove forests at Townsville (Australia) and Iriomote Island (Japan) are given.

A mathematical model is developed for small-amplitude periodic waves, scattered by an array of submerged vertical cylinders within an infinitely long strip. Assuming a strong contrast between the cylinder spacing and the typical wavelength, the multi-scale perturbation theory of homogenization is employed to derive the governing equations for the macro-scale wave dynamics and the boundary-value problem of micro-scale flows within a unit cell of the cylinder array. The constitutive coefficients in the macro-scale governing equations are computed using the solutions of the micro-scale boundary-value problem, being driven by the macro-scale pressure gradients. Flow turbulences in the vicinity of cylinders are represented by the eddy viscosity model in which the bulk eddy viscosity is determined by balancing the time-averaged rate of energy dissipation and the rate of work done by wave forces on the cylinders, integrated over the entire submerged forest. The wave forces are calculated by the Morison-type formula, in which a new drag formula as a function of Reynolds number is constructed based on existing and newly conducted experimental data. The potential decomposition method is employed in solving the waves/vegetation interaction problem on the macro-scale, which well captures the effects of wave scattering. The theory was checked with several sets of experimental data for normally incident waves. The agreement between the theory and experiments is very good for cases where the submerged forest heights vary from shallow to near water depth. Results for obliquely incident waves are also presented and discussed,",2,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part 2: Deformation of Storm Waves on the Beach with Fringing Reef Along the East Coast of Eastern Samar,"This paper investigates characteristics of coastal damage caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan with special focuses on locally varying wave deformations along the coast of Eastern Samar fronted by shallow fringing reef. The paper first summarized the field survey results and indicated that the erosion depth of the beach had negative correlation with the width of fringing reef along the straight coastline while a drastic variation of the damage levels was observed around Matarinao Bay mouth. A phase-resolved nonlinear dispersive wave model and a linear mild slope equation model were respectively applied for computations of wave deformations on the long-straight coastline with fringing reef and on the coast around Matarinao Bay. Computed rapid decay of waves on the reef reasonably explained observed negative correlations between erosion depth and the reef width. Around Matarinao Bay, on the other hand, wave refraction and diffraction played a significant role to explain wave concentration on the reef just outside of the bay mouth and also significant wave attenuation inside the bay mouth. Observed wave deformation characteristics were not sensitive to incident wave angles and periods and were reasonably consistent with the observed along-shore variation of maximum water levels and corresponding damages along the coast.",15,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of damage of the cyclone was estimated for three situations: (1) villages protected by mangrove and within a polder, (2) villages not protected by mangrove but within a polder, and (3) villages not protected by mangrove and not within a polder. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 300 households selected from these villages by stratified random sampling. Significant differences in all the considered damage assessment attributes were obtained comparing the villages protected by mangrove with those not protected by mangrove. Quantifiable monetary loss associated with the cyclone was TK 69,726 (US$ 1025) per household in the villages sheltered by mangrove, which was about half compared to the villages not in the shadow of mangrove. Loss incurred perhousehold was highest in villages that are not protected by mangrove and polder.

Previous studies have shown that an oscillatory flow induced by monochromatic surface waves will drive more flow inside a canopy than a comparable unidirectional current. This paper builds on these previous studies by investigating how wave energy is attenuated within canopies under spectral wave conditions, or random wave fields defined by many frequencies. A theoretical model is first developed to predict how flow attenuation within a canopy varies among the different wave components and predicts that shorter-period components will generally be more effective at driving flow within a canopy than longer-period components. To investigate the model performance, a field experiment was conducted on a shallow reef flat in which flow was measured both inside and above a model canopy array. Results confirm that longer-period components in the spectrum are significantly more attenuated than shorter-period components, in good agreement with the model prediction. This paper concludes by showing that the rate at which wave energy is dissipated by a canopy is closely linked to the flow structure within the canopy. Under spectral wave conditions, wave energy within a model canopy array is dissipated at a greater rate among the shorter-period wave components. These observations are consistent with previous observations of how wave energy is dissipated by the bottom roughness of a coral reef.",MAY 11 2007,2007,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intention of this paper is to find out the exact wave damping rate with the presence of mangroves, to figure out the results due to spatial distinction and the reasons of that. The measured sites named Lianhua Shan in Panyu and Leizhou Bay were chosen for their representative characteristics- there in the pass-by tropical storms usually stir up onshore and offshore wind. Wave gauges were mounted in line perpendicular to the coastline to record the time history of surface displacement synchronously during certain time periods. The data analysis indicates that both sites witness prominent wave damping, and coupled with bottom friction after 100 meters the measured maximum dissipation rate of wave height reaches 80%. Wave energy spectrum analysis is done as well to show the differences in energy dissipation under different water levels. Further insight into the wave damping rate manifests that spatial difference is significant particularly during the typhoon period due to its position relative to the storm route. What's more, examining the spectral wave energy dissipation pattern tells that water depth is a determinant factor to the spectrum shape and the dissipation capability of vegetation is distinct at different frequencies. Serving as natural coastal protection schemes, mangrove forests effectively mitigate the coastal hydrodynamics and reversely are greatly affected by hydrodynamics, contributing to an interactional stable aquatic ecosystem.

This paper presents field data on wave attenuance collected over a 13 month period in a Zostera noltii meadow. The meadow showed a strong seasonality with high shoot densities in summer (approximately 4,600 shoots/m(2)) and low densities in winter (approximately 600 shoots/m(2)). Wave heights and flow velocities were measured along a transect at regular intervals during which the site was exposed to wind waves and boat wakes that differ in wave period and steepness. This difference was used to investigate whether wave attenuation by sea grass changes with hydrodynamic conditions. A seasonal change in wave attenuation was observed from the data. Results suggest that a minimum shoot density is necessary to initiate wave attenuation by sea grass. Additionally, a dependence of wave attenuation on hydrodynamics was found. Results suggest that the threshold shoot density varies with wave period and a change in energy dissipation toward the shore was observed once this threshold was exceeded. An attempt was made to quantify the bed roughness of the meadow; the applicability of this roughness value in swaying vegetation is discussed. Finally, the drag coefficient for the meadow was computed: A relationship between wave attenuance and vegetation Reynolds number was found which allows comparing the wave attenuating effect of Zostera noltii to other plant species.",69,2011,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a four-week period in February 2005, cyclones Meena, Nancy, Olaf, and Percy struck the Cook Islands. Because these cyclones were stronger than Cyclone Sally in 1987, which is reputed to have caused the most damage to Rarotonga in the past, the government was well prepared for the storm and its effects. Evacuation shelters were set-up throughout the island and no injuries or casualties were reported. In contrast, the storm surge and high waves of Sally devastated houses, shops, and the airport on the seafront in north Rarotonga. Since Sally, the government of the Cook Islands has worked together with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to specifically protect the shoreline from storm surge; the outcome of their work provides scientific information regarding vulnerability to future hypothetical cyclone events. The purpose of this study is to reduce such vulnerability by assessing the cyclone of the 100-year return period and to evaluate the allowable seawall height. Mathematical models are proposed to estimate the following components: (1) wave attenuation and set-up on a coral reef; (2) wave run-up on a foreshore slope; and (3) irregular wave-overtopping of a seawall.

The study area was situated on a riverbank, which consisted of a bare mudflat containing a vegetation gradient from pioneering mangroves to 5- to 7-year-old mangroves. Measurements were conducted in the dry season (February/March 2000) and in the wet season (July/August 2000). Actual sedimentation rates were measured using sediment traps and the elevation of the area was surveyed in both periods. Two undisturbed sediment cores were taken in the densely vegetated area for (210)Pb-dating analysis and showed long-term sedimentation rates of 0.22 g cm(-2) yr(-1) and 0.36 g cm(-2) yr(-1). Sedimentation rates recorded by the sediment traps in the vegetated area were 2.94 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the dry season and 3.46 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the wet season. In both seasons, the sedimentation rates on the bare mudflat were five to ten times higher than in the densely vegetated area. However, the elevation of the mudflat was slightly lower in the wet season than in the dry season. This implies that erosion must have taken place between March and July. This study demonstrates that the bare mud bank of an estuary is highly dynamic until mangroves cover it. Sediment delivery to the vegetated zones is low but the protective effect of vegetation against erosion by waves and currents is strong. This results in small but steady actual sedimentation rates under mangroves and therefore sustained long term accretion. The study further identifies the need for similar measurements to be made in different seasons covering the effects of periodic storm events. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These aspects are hinged in part on the capacity of these meadows to attenuate waves and to slow down currents. Berre lagoon (area: 155 km(2)) is a fetch-limited, micro-tidal brackish water body on the French Mediterranean coast. At the turn of the 20th century, the lagoon was occupied by extensive meadows of Zostera marina and Zostera noltii. Urban and industrial pollution and freshwater diversion into the lagoon contributed to the complete disappearance of Zostera marina while Zostera noltii declined dramatically. Since the 1970s, these sources of perturbation have been drastically reduced but with no appreciable effect on Zostera noltii. A study was carried out on a receding Zostera noltii meadow occupying a small shallow bay (<2 m deep) fronting a beach over a 14-month period in order to monitor both patterns of shoot density and erosion and accretion in the bay. Berre lagoon experiences short-fetch waves generated by northwesterly Mistral winds that exhibit a seasonal pattern. Shoot density shows a markedly seasonal trend that does not appear to be related to bed changes, which evened out over the study period. The data show that bed changes are less marked over the Zostera noltii meadow, and are more important in non-colonized areas, as well as along the beach, which exhibits sediment rotation. These patterns are probably reflecting the influence of the meadow on wave dissipation patterns.",8,2014,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the surveyed mangrove swamp plots showed much lower suspension concentrations (0.09-0.6 g l(-1)), and low albeit minimum rates of accretion (1.1-3 mm a(-1)), monitored between 1980 and 1989. These low rates are attributed mainly to the short duration of tidal flooding due to a high substrate elevation within the tidal range, and to the low settling potential of the very fine-grained suspensions circulating over the swamps. A comparison of two sets of aerial photographs (1954-1960 and 1976) showed that these swamps and their channel networks are also characterised by a remarkable medium-term morphodynamic stability. This stability and the low accretion suggest that the swamps and their channel networks are largely in equilibrium with the hydrology, notably flooding duration, and sediment loads. Settling out of mud from the turbidity zones contributes to higher accretion rates (up to 12 mm a(-1), not taking into account the effects of shallow subsidence) on parts of the mudflats fronting the mangroves which are flooded for longer periods. Some of the mud is deposited over sandy channel bars in the main bay channel and the rest exported seaward. It is tentatively suggested that an increase in the duration of tidal flooding generated by global sea-level rise, at the presently predicted rates, could lead to higher sedimentation in the mangrove swamps, thus enhancing accretion and the chances of mangrove survival.

However, those efforts are not considered to be the best solution in reducing the impacts of the hazards. This study aimed to determine the sediment accumulation rates based on natural isotopes Pb-210 dating and hydro-oceanographic modeling technique. According to Pb-210 analysis, we calculated the sediment accumulation rates at Surodadi and Timbulsloko of 0.145 cm/year and 0.06 cm/year, respectively. The sediment compositions are dominated by terrestrial sediment typified by clay deposits. The sedimentary rate average of Sayung Coast prior to HE installation (2011-2013) was 0.195 cm/year. The rate of sediment accumulation rose to around 0.4 cm/year in 2016 in accordance with the increase of Mangrove area from around 409 hectares in 2013 to about 455.79 hectares in 2015. The increase of sedimentary rate recent years became an evidence that mitigation efforts to reduce abrasion temporarily succeeded. (C) 2020 Atom Indonesia.

Variable morphologies and life-history strategies, however, are likely to impact the sediment stabilization capacity of different seagrass species. We question how opportunistic invasive species and increasing grazing by megaherbivores may alter sediment stabilization services provided by established seagrass meadows, using the Caribbean as a case study. Utilizing two portable field-flumes that simulate unidirectional and oscillatory flow regimes, we compared the sediment stabilization capacity of natural seagrass meadows in situ under current- and wave-dominated regimes. Monospecific patches of a native (Thalassia testudinum) and an invasive (Halophila stipulacea) seagrass species were compared, along with the effect of three levels of megaherbivore grazing on T. testudinum: ungrazed, lightly grazed and intensively grazed. For both hydrodynamic regimes, the long-leaved, dense meadows of the climax species, T. testudinum provided the highest stabilization. However, the loss of above-ground biomass by intensive grazing reduced the capacity of the native seagrass to stabilize the surface sediment. Caribbean seagrass meadows are presently threatened by the rapid spread of the invasive opportunistic seagrass, H. stipulacea. The dense meadows of H. stipulacea were found to accumulate fine sediment, and thereby, appear to be effective in reducing bottom shear stress during calm periods. This fine sediment within the invasive meadows, however, is easily resuspended by hydrodynamic forces, and the low below-ground biomass of H. stipulacea make it susceptible to uprooting during storm events, potentially leaving large regions vulnerable to erosion. Overall, this present study highlights that intensive megaherbivore grazing and opportunistic invasive species threaten the coastal protection services provided by mildly grazed native species. Synthesis. Seagrass meadows of dense, long-leaved species stabilize the sediment surface and maintain the seabed integrity, thereby contributing to coastal protection. These services are threatened by intensive megaherbivore grazing, which reduces the stability of the surface sediment, and opportunistic invasive species, which are susceptible to uprooting in storms and thereby can leave the seabed vulnerable to erosion.",2,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave ,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological changes associated with salt marsh erosion are expected to influence the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics of coastal systems. Here the influence of salt marsh erosion on the tidal hydrodynamics and sediment storage capability of shallow bays is investigated. Hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and vegetation dynamics are simulated using the numerical framework Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport in the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor system, USA. We show that salt marsh erosion influences the propagation of tides into back-barrier basins, reducing the periodic inundation and sediment delivery to marsh platforms. As salt marshes erode, the sediment trapping potential of marsh platforms decreases exponentially. In this test case, up to 50% of the sediment mass trapped by vegetation is lost once a quarter of the marsh area is eroded. Similarly, without salt marshes the sediment budget of the entire bay significantly declines. Therefore, a positive feedback might be triggered such that as the salt marsh retreats the sediment storage capacity of the system declines, which could in turn further exacerbate marsh degradation.",18,2018,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these habitats can respond by increasing their relative elevation, or by migrating into adjacent areas. Here we provide the first report on surface elevation change for salt marsh at the Knysna Estuary, South Africa, and predict the responses of these habitats to sea-level rise using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Recent (2018) surface elevation measurements at lower intertidal salt marsh sites were compared with those from 2009-2011. The long-term (1960-2017) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) was estimated as 2.19 mm y-1 and only two of the seven sites assessed are keeping pace with this RSLR. The SLAMM, which was applied to a focus area near Thesen's Island, predicted up to 40% loss of upper intertidal salt marsh by 2100, because development in the adjacent area prevents habitat migration. Currently, salt marsh habitats cover a total of 667 ha, and artificial structures are present along 20.7 km of the perimeter. Protecting areas for salt marsh migration should be a conservation priority, because this estuary supports the third largest area of intertidal salt marsh in the country. Monitoring the responses of coastal wetlands should be prioritised so that natural capital contributes towards future resilience.",5,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prediction and quantification of wave attenuation characteristics by mangroves is an essential pre-requisite for coastal zone management activities along a mangrove dominated shoreline. Nevertheless, the dynamic impact of waves on mangroves is missing in the current regional wave forecasting systems. In this review article, the scientific advancements in wave-mangrove interaction studies are elucidated and focus on its significance in an operational wave modeling scheme for the Indian coast. The relevant studies on wave dissipation by mangroves and other vegetation; its nonlinear interaction in the presence of currents and extreme waves, and the need for improving its parameterization are considered distinctly. The study also highlights the importance to predict the futuristic scenarios of wave attenuation characteristics in mangrove dominated regions which are highly sensitive to effects from climate change.

Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued as effective natural buffers for storm surges by dissipating wave energy and providing flood water storage. While previous studies focused on flood wave attenuation within and behind wetlands, this study focuses on the effects of estuarine wetland properties on the attenuation of a storm tide that propagates along the length of an estuary. Wetland properties including elevation, surface area, and location within the estuary were investigated using a numerical model of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, SW Netherlands). For a spring tide lower wetland elevations result in more attenuation of high water levels along the estuary, while for a higher storm tide higher elevations provide more attenuation compared to lower wetland elevations. For spring and storm tide a larger wetland surface area results in a better attenuation along the estuary up to a threshold wetland size for which larger wetlands do not further contribute to more attenuation. Finally a wetland of the same size and elevation, but located more upstream in the estuary, can store a larger proportion of the local flood volume and therefore has a larger attenuating effect on upstream high water levels. With this paper we aim to contribute towards a better understanding and wider implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation to increasing estuarine flood risks associated with storms.",29,2015,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of a long-term study (2012-present) comparing ecosystem functions of marsh and black mangrove vegetation, we have experimentally maintained marsh and black mangrove patches (3 m x 3 m) along a plot-level (24 m x 42 m) gradient of marsh and mangrove cover in coastal wetlands near Port Aransas, TX. In August 2017, this experiment was directly in the path of Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 storm. This extreme disturbance event provided an opportunity to quantify differences in resistance between mangrove and marsh vegetation and to assess which vegetation type provided better shoreline protection against storm-driven erosion. We compared changes in plant cover, shoreline erosion, and accreted soil depth to values measured prior to storm landfall. Relative mangrove cover decreased 25-40% after the storm, regardless of initial cover, largely due to damage on taller mangroves (> 2.5 m height) that were not fully inundated by storm surge and were therefore exposed to strong winds. Evidence of regrowth on damaged mangrove branches was apparent within 2 months of landfall. Hurricane-induced decreases in mangrove cover were partially ameliorated by the presence of neighboring mangroves, particularly closer to the shoreline. Marsh plants were generally resistant to hurricane effects. Shoreline erosion exceeded 5 m where mangroves were absent (100% marsh cover) but was relatively modest (< 0.5 m) in plots with mangroves present (11-100% mangrove cover). Storm-driven accreted soil depth was variable but more than 2x higher in marsh patches than in mangrove patches. In general, mangroves provided shoreline protection from erosion but were also more damaged by wind and surge, which may reduce their shoreline protection capacity over longer time scales.",6,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to quantify the attenuation of incident wave height through a seagrass meadow and characterize the blade movement under oscillatory flow under the low-energy conditions characteristic of fetch-limited and sheltered environments. The horizontal motion of the seagrass blades and the velocity just above the seagrass canopy were measured using a digital video camera and an acoustic Doppler velicometer (ADV) respectively in order to refine the estimates of the drag coefficient based on the relative velocity. Significant wave heights (H-s) were observed to increase by similar to 0.02 m (similar to 20%) through the first 5 m of the seagrass bed but subsequently decrease exponentially over the remainder of the bed. The exponential decay coefficient varied in response to the Reynolds number calculated using blade width ( as the length scale) and the oscillatory velocity measured immediately above the canopy. The ability of the seagrass to attenuate wave energy decreases as incident wave heights increase and conditions become more turbulent. Estimates of the time-averaged canopy height and the calculated hydraulic roughness suggest that, as the oscillatory velocity increases, the seagrass becomes fully extended and leans in the direction of flow for a longer part of the wave cycle. The relationship between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number further suggests that the vegetation is swaying (going with the flow) at low-energy conditions but becomes increasingly rigid as oscillatory velocities increase over the limited range of the conditions observed (200 < Re < 800). In addition to the changing behavior of the seagrass motion, the attenuation was not uniform with wave frequency, and waves at a secondary frequency of 0.38 Hz (2.6 s) appeared to be unaffected by the seagrass. Cospectral analysis between the oscillatory and blade velocity suggests that the seagrass was moving in phase with the current at the (lower) secondary frequency and out of phase at the (higher) peak frequency. In this respect, seagrass is not only an attenuator of wave energy but also serves as a low-pass filter; higher frequencies in the spectra tend to be more attenuated.",153,2009,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From studies of historical events, reefs can behave as buffers or as amplifiers of inundation, depending upon the location. Interactions between reefs and tsunamis have generally been analyzed with idealized models, and there have been only few studies of specific reefs and their characteristics. Using numerical NonLinear Shallow Water models, this study characterizes the influence of the Southeast Ishigaki Island reef during the 1771 tsunami that hit the Yaeyama Islands. In this work, we modified reef topography in silica and then, measured the impact of these changes using a new parameter, the Reef Impact Factor (RIF). First, a reference model was built, simulating the real event with an accurate reef representation and using run-up data to calibrate bottom friction. This calibration highlights the difficulty of representing reef friction with a homogeneous coefficient. Second, a model without a reef was compared to the reference model. The impact of reef removal varies considerably along the coastline and maximum wave heights at the shore were strongly affected, with a 12.5% increase on average. Overall, this suggests a protective role of the reef along most of the coast. However, at local scale, channels that break the continuity of the front reef, increased wave heights by up to 40% on the proximate coast, revealing their strong focusing influence. Finally, changes in tide level, which regulates reef depth, were investigated, showing a global positive correlation between sea level and maximum wave height at the coast. However, the impact of the reef depth appeared weak compared to the impact of incident wave parameters. This study contributes to a global effort to understand tsunami-reef interactions in a non-idealized framework, suggesting a Reef Impact Factor for inter-reef/study comparisons. Moreover, vulnerable and exposed coasts were identified at Ishigaki Island, which may help to improve inundation forecasting, resulting in more appropriate management of these vulnerable sections of the coast.",0,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it was shown that peak significant wave heights vary inversely with marsh/seabed elevation, due to wave depth-dependency.

We quantified the interactions between these longitudinal gaps and the hydrodynamic environment of the nearshore environment to determine their potential impact on seagrass meadow ecology. Within the meadow at leaf length distances from the edge, wave attenuation by the lateral vegetation next to the gap was approximately the same as attenuation by fully vegetated areas, and the wave attenuating capacity of the lateral, near-gap vegetation was independent of gap width. Gaps with widths less than twice the leaf length exhibited 8% wave attenuation and 11% turbulent kinetic energy attenuation, confirming that vegetation shelters at least small gaps. Despite similar capacity for wave attenuation, the longitudinal gaps influenced the architectural characteristics of the adjacent (lateral) meadow; lateral shoot density, percent cover and leaf length adjacent to the largest gap were 12, 16, and 20% lower than the fully vegetated site, respectively. Significant differences in the temporal variation of the mean lateral, near-gap seagrass percent cover and the leaf length indicated a strong dependence of the state of the canopy on temporal hydrodynamic conditions, which in turn were impacted by the presence of the gap.

Raqubul",Quantifying the protective capacity of mangroves from storm surges in coastal Bangladesh,"Mangroves are an important ecosystem-based protection against cyclonic storm surge. As the surge moves through the mangrove forest, the tree roots, trunks, and leaves obstruct the flow of water. Damage to adjacent coastal lands is attenuated mainly by reducing (i) surge height, which determines the area and depth of inundation and (ii) water flow velocity. But the extent of mangrove protection depends on the density of tree plantings and the diameter of trunks and roots, along with an array of other forest characteristics (e.g., floor shape, bathymetry, spectral features of waves, and tidal stage at which waves enter the forest). Making efficient use of mangroves protective capacity has been hindered by a lack of location-specific information. This study helps to fill that gap by estimating reduction in storm surge height and water flow velocity from mangroves at selected sites in cyclone-prone, coastal Bangladesh. A hydrodynamic model for the Bay of Bengal, based on the MIKE21FM system, was run multiple times to simulate the surge of cyclone Sidr (2007) at the Barisal coast. Estimates of surge height and water flow velocity were recorded first without mangroves and then with mangroves of various forest widths and planting densities, including specific information on local topography, bathymetry, and Mannings coefficients estimated from species root and trunk systems.

Knowledge on wave attenuation over saltmarsh surfaces is also essential for accurate assessments of their natural sea-defence value to be made and incorporated into sea defence and management schemes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of a digital photographic method for the quantification of marsh vegetation density and then to investigate the relative roles played by hydrodynamic controls and vegetation density/type in causing the attenuation of incident waves over a macro-tidal saltmarsh.Results show that a significant statistical relationship exists between the density of vegetation measured in side-on photographs and the dry biomass of the photographed vegetation determined through direct harvesting. The potential of the digital photographic method for the spatial and temporal comparison of marsh surface vegetation biomass, density, and canopy structure is highlighted and the method was applied to assess spatial and seasonal differences in vegetation density and their effect on wave attenuation at three locations on a macro-tidal saltmarsh on Dengie Peninsula, Essex, UK. In this environmental setting, vegetation density/type did not have a significant direct effect on wave attenuation but modified the process of wave transformation under different hydrodynamic conditions. At the two locations, characterised by a relatively tall canopy (15-26 cm) with biomass values of 430-500 g m(-2), dominated by Spartina spp. (> 70% of total dry biomass), relative incident wave height (wave height/water depth) is identified as a statistically significant dominant positive control on wave attenuation up to a threshold value of 0.55, beyond which wave attenuation showed no significant further increase. At the third location, characterised by only slightly less biomass (398 g m(-2)) but a shorter (6 cm) canopy of the annual Salicornia spp., no significant relationship existed between wave attenuation and relative wave height. Seasonally (between September and December) significant temporal increase/decrease in vegetation density occurred in one of the Spartina canopies and in the Salicornia canopy, respectively, and led to an expected (but not statistically significant) increase/decrease in wave attenuation. The wider implications of these findings in the context of form-process interactions on saltmarshes and their effect on marsh evolution are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are gaps in storm surge measurements collected in marsh areas during extreme events as well as understanding of storm surge processes. The present study evaluates the importance and variation of different processes (i.e., wave, current, and water level dynamics with respect of the marsh topography and vegetation characteristics) involved in a storm surge over a marsh, assesses how these processes contribute to storm surge attenuation, and quantifies the storm surge attenuation in field conditions. During the Fall of 2015, morphology and vegetation surveys were conducted along a marsh transect in a coastal marsh located at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, mainly composed of Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens. Hydrodynamic surveys were conducted during two storm events. Collected data included wave characteristics, current velocity and direction, and water levels. Data analysis focused on the understanding of the cross-shore evolution of waves, currents and water level, and their influence on the overall storm surge attenuation. Results indicate that the marsh area, despite its short length, attenuates waves and reduces current velocity and water level. Tides have a dominant influence on current direction and velocity, but the presence of vegetation and the marsh morphology contribute to a strong reduction of current velocity over the marsh platform relative to the currents at the marsh front. Wave attenuation varies across the tide cycle which implies a link between wave attenuation and water level and, consequently, storm surge height. Storm surge reduction, here assessed through high water level (HWL) attenuation, is linked to wave attenuation across the front edge of the marsh; this positive trend highlights the reduction of water level height induced by wave setup reduction during wave propagation across the marsh front edge. Water level attenuation rates observed here have a greater range than the rates observed or modeled by other authors, and our results suggest that this is linked to the strong influence of waves in storm surge attenuation over coastal areas.",18,2017,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little empirical data quantifying the protective effects of mangroves during storms, primarily because of the difficulty of predicting where and when a storm will intersect the shoreline, to facilitate data collection before and after storm events. In 2005, opportunistic results from an ongoing study quantifying differences between intact and cleared mangrove areas on Turneffe Atoll, Belize, provided such pre- and post-storm data from tropical storms 'Wilma' (later a Category 5 Hurricane) and 'Gamma'. We compared differences in equipment retention rates of 3 types of experimental devices previously installed in adjacent intact and cleared mangrove areas. Retention rates were greater in intact mangrove areas, empirically demonstrating the protective capacity of mangroves during moderate magnitude storm events. The results support the assumption that removal of mangroves diminishes coastal protection not only during catastrophic storm events such as hurricanes or tsunamis, but also during less energetic but more frequent events, such as tropical storms. This highlights the importance of improved coastal zone management, as storm events may increase in frequency and intensity with changing climate, and coastal mangrove forest habitats continue to decline in size and number.",2007,2007,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are threatened by predominately anthropogenic activities which are causing their decline in many regions, often converting large continuous meadows into highly fragmented ones with gaps or bare sand interspersed within the meadows. To evaluate the impact fragmentation is having on the meadows' capacity to attenuate waves, the hydrodynamics in four meadows with different fragmentation were studied by measuring wave velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. In our study area, as gap size increases, both the turbulent kinetic energy and wave velocity increase in the center of the gaps. However, although wave attenuation varied between the different fragmentation levels, no clear trend was found for wave attenuation or the level of fragmentation. Simply put, neither wave velocity nor turbulent kinetic energy presented significant trends with the fragmentation levels of the canopy on larger scales. Therefore, within the spatial and temporal limitation of this study, fragmentation on a landscape scale did not affect the hydrodynamics within the gaps. Furthermore, as with hydrodynamics, sedimentation rates also increased with gap size, but did not show differences at the landscape level with the fragmentation levels of the meadows.",0,2020,WoS,,field,CI,COMP,gravity,,,,,Spain,Europe,temperate,Mediterranean,seagrass,Posidonia Oceanica,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,neutral,yes,figure 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are challenges in development of this natural coastal protection, e.g. mangrove-seedling-trees have been damaged by the waves or current, before they are growth strongly which required at least 2 years of plantation. To solve this problem, a natural coastal protection system consists of combination of main natural protection and temporary manmade structures is proposed. The study aimed to quantify the wave height reduction with various mangrove densities as well as the influence of mangrove seedling trees arrangements on wave reduction. The laboratory experiments were conducted in a narrow wave flume using model of mangrove as main natural protection and geotextile-geobag models as temporary manmade structure. Various wave conditions were generated during this laboratory test. This paper focus on the experiment results of wave transmission over mangrove seedling trees in order to determine the most effective configuration of mangrove trees plantation against wave. The results showed that the wave height reduction in area with mangroves was about two times larger compared to that in bare land.

Devastating incidents in recent years due to extreme environmental and catastrophic conditions that lead to various degrees of damages in the coastal areas have significantly increased awareness on the role of mangrove forests as eco-engineering approach to coastal stability and defense. With the recent urge for mangroves protection and replanting, a sound basis for a more optimum strategy in maintaining mangroves as coastal protection buffer is inevitably required. Hence, this study is aimed to quantify the reduction of wave height by 10 years old mangroves with various densities and tree arrangements. The laboratory experiments were conducted in a narrow wave flume using artificial mangrove models. The results showed that wave height reduction in areas of 100 m width of 10 years old mangroves was 2.5 times more effective as compared to areas without mangroves. Earlier investigation revealed that for areas with 20 years old mangroves was able to dissipate waves four times greater compared to areas without mangroves. For areas with 200 m width of 10 years old mangroves, a density of 0.11 trees/m(2) is sufficient to reduce wave height over 77 %.

Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards living shoreline approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40% at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m 22 at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297%) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108%), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88%) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.)

This causes heavy loss of beach material due to large-scale erosion. If these waves are made to break prematurely and away from the beach, they can be attenuated so as to reduce beach erosion. The reef, which is a homogeneous pile of armour units without a core, breaks the steeper ocean waves, dissipates a major portion of their energy and transmits attenuated waves.

An explicit depth-averaged hydrodynamic model coupled with a wave spectral model (CMS-wave) was proposed in this study in order to simulate the wave and wave-induced current in coastal waters. The hydrodynamic model was based on the finite volume method while the intercell flux was computed by employing the Harten-Lax-van Leer approximate Riemann solver to investigate the dry-to-wet interface, and the drag force of vegetation was modeled as the sink terms in the momentum equations. The CMS-wave model was used to investigate the non-breaking and the breaking random waves propagation in vegetation fields. Afterwards, an empirical wave energy dissipation term with plant effect was derived to represent the resistance induced by aquatic vegetation in the wave-action balance equation. The established model was calibrated and validated with both the experimental and field data. The results showed that the wave height decreased significantly along the wave propagation direction in the presence of vegetations. The sensitivity analysis for the plant density, the wave height, and the water depth were performed by comparing the numerical results for the wave height attenuation. In addition, wave and wave-induced current through a finite patch of vegetation in the surf zone were investigated as well. The strong radiation stress gradient could be produced due to the variation of the energy dissipation by vegetation effect in the nearshore zone, which impacted the direction and amplitude of the longshore current.

First, the attenuation of storm surge by mangroves is incorporated into the model by updating Manning's coefficient based on the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) 2001. Then CEST is verified by comparing the model results with field observations in South Florida for Hurricane Wilma. Secondly, a set of numerical experiments using synthetic hurricanes with different intensity, forward speed, radius of maximum wind speed and travel direction are conducted for the sensitivity study. Results indicate that storm surge magnitudes and flooding areas are reduced by the mangrove zone more for fast moving hurricanes than slow moving hurricanes in the west coast of South Florida. In addition, increasing hurricane intensity and hurricane size lower the effect of mangroves on attenuating storm surge and reducing the flooding area. The mangrove zone plays a more effective role in reducing flooding areas from hurricanes that travel from east to west than from hurricanes that travel from west to east. The mangrove reduction effect is most sensitive to changes in hurricane forward speed. A 6.7 m/s to 2.2 m/s decrease in forward speed can result in a decrease in flood area reduction by mangroves that is equivalent to the decrease in flood area reduction by mangroves from Category 3 to 5 hurricanes.

Using plants as a natural buffer from wave impacts remains an attractive possibility. In this paper, we present a numerical investigation on the effects of the emerged vegetation on non-breaking, breaking and broken wave propagation through vegetation over flat and sloping beds using the Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with a volume of fluid (VOF) surface capturing method. The multiphase two-equation k-omega SST turbulence model is adopted to simulate wave breaking and takes into account the effects enhanced by vegetation. The numerical model is validated with existing data from several laboratory experiments. The sensitivities of wave height evolution due to wave conditions and vegetation characteristics with variable bathymetry have been investigated. The results show good agreement with measured data. For non-breaking waves, the wave reflection due to the vegetation can increase wave height in front of the vegetation. For breaking waves, it is shown that the wave breaking behavior can be different when the vegetation is in the surf zone. The wave breaking point is slightly earlier and the wave height at the breaking point is smaller with the vegetation. For broken waves, the vegetation has little effect on the wave height before the breaking point. Meanwhile, the inertia force is important within denser vegetation and is intended to decrease the wave damping of the vegetation. Overall, the present model has good performance in simulating non-breaking, breaking and broken wave interaction with the emerged vegetation and can achieve a better understanding of wave propagation over the emerged vegetation.",1,2019,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to investigate the tsunami mitigation effects of vegetation by changing the density distribution in a forest model. A one-dimensional numerical model using Boussinesq-type equations including porosity of vegetation and its drag and inertia forces was developed. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a wave channel, and vegetation was modeled simply by wooden cylinders. The applicability of the numerical model was confirmed by good agreement with experimental results. In uniform arrangement, even with the same dn (where d=diameter of a cylinder, n=number of cylinders in the streamwise direction per unit of cross-stream width), the velocity behind the vegetation was reduced by about 17% as the tree density increased about 25 times. In combined arrangements of cylinders with different densities, the velocity behind the vegetation was reduced by about 8% as the tree density increased about 8 times.

This paper presents a refraction-diffraction wave model for the investigation of wave propagation through a coastal mild slope zone in the presence of rigid vegetation via numerical simulation. The model is based on the implementation of a module for vegetation-induced wave energy dissipation in the parabolic mild slope equation. The model is capable of simulating both wave refraction and diffraction and economical in computation and may bridge the gap between the wave energy spectrum and the phase-resolved models for wave propagation through coastal vegetation fields. The model is validated through by comparison with experimental results. The model is subsequently applied to a simulation of a wave propagating on a plane in the presence of different patterns of rigid vegetation. The sensitivity of the wave height to the plant height, the diameter and the stem density is investigated by comparison of the numerical results for wave height attenuation that results from different patterns of rigid vegetation. The numerical results show that wave height attenuation due to rigid vegetation has a higher variability for the different rigid plant conditions and that the attenuation of the wave height due to the rigid vegetation increases alongside the plant height under water as well as the diameter and plant stem density. The results further indicate that for wave propagates through coastal rigid vegetation zones with a high plant height underwater, large diameter and high stem density, the wave height along the propagating direction is decreased nonlinearly with the increase of the wave propagating distance, and nonlinearity is more obvious for the plant with a higher height under water as well as a larger diameter and higher stem density.

The calibration process suitably compared the calculated results with the measured data. The tsunami waves were also simulated to discuss the water depth, tsunami force, as well as the current speed in absence of and in presence of forest domain. The results indicated that forest growth at the beach reduced wave energy loss caused by tsunamis.

As a first approximation, the problem is modeled utilizing solitary waves impinging on emergent/submerged rigid cylinders. A three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model using cyclic boundary conditions was developed based on the IHFOAM solver to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on the solitary wave attenuation. The numerical model was established based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the standard k - omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) surface capturing schemes. The results indicate that different patterns are found in terms of flow field characteristics (velocity and turbulent kinetic energy) and forces exerted on the cylinders for various wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration, which helps to better understand wave dissipation mechanism induced by vegetation. Different from the bulk drag coefficient derived by the conventional wave dissipation models, the direct force method was applied to quantify the time-varying and period-averaged drag coefficients (C-D) of individual cylinders. The time-varying C-D associated with maximum force and local velocity is defined as the representative C-D, for comparison with the period-averaged C-D in detail. Besides, by considering the submergence ratio, new generic C-D formulas are proposed as functions of the modified Reynolds number (Re) and Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC) for illustrating the C-D dynamics under solitary wave conditions. Finally, a preliminary comparison between the proposed C-D formulas and existing formulas are given to reveal the intrinsic C-D law, which may lead to improved understanding and modeling concerning wave-vegetation interaction.",1,2020,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of mangrove forest for dissipating wave is still unclear, especially for short wave such as regular wave. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of mangrove forest in dissipating regular wave by using numerical simulation approach. To simulate short waves accurately, one should choose a dispersive wave model. In this research, we choose a Boussinesq type of model, i.e. the Variational Boussinesq (VB) model as the wave model. Here, the Finite Volume method is chosen as the numerical implementation of model, in a staggered grid scheme. The dissipation process by the mangrove forest is modelled as a bottom dissipation that equivalent with a Manning's coefficient that is derived from physical experiment. The resulting numerical implementation is then validated with experimental data from hydrodynamic laboratory which gives relatively accurate results. To analyze the effectiveness of dissipation by mangrove forest, we perform various simulation scenarios with various length of mangrove forest.

Here, taking the Da Guan Sha of Beihai city, China, as a case study, the landscape metrics characterizing mangrove structures, including the diameter at breast height (DBH), crown breadth, crown density, and rhizome and stem systems, were obtained through remote sensing and field measurements. Then, the nonlinear spatiotemporal pattern of the wave attenuation function (decreasing rate of wave height) was explored and revealed among six 20x200 m parallel transects passing through mangroves along the direction of the current. The results showed the following: (1) The DBH and crown breadth first increased and then decreased from the seaward to landward side of each transect, showing a nonlinear inverted U pattern of distribution. (2) The wave attenuation function of mangroves was dominated by the canopy at high tide but significantly affected by the structure of the rhizome or stem system at low tide. The wave height during a specific storm surge could decrease by nearly 97% among the six transects at high tide but by only 87% at low tide on average if the wave crossed through the mangroves over a distance of >= 100 m from the seaward side of the mangroves edge. (3) The wet surface width of a major part of mangrove trees with wave attenuation functions would change with the distribution of the DBH, crown breadth, and tree height along the transects, which would also change with the dynamics of the water level. The wave attenuation of mangroves ranged from 85% to 90% at low tide and from 96% to 97% at high tide if the wave crossed through mangroves at a distance of >= 100 m from the seaward side of the mangrove edge. (4) The predicted practical decreasing rate of wave height based on the forward differencing method (a method that considered the varied vegetation structure along transects in the model during the calculation of wave attenuation, which would be close to reality) would be 12% and 9% higher at low and high tide, respectively, than those estimated by the simplified calculation method (a method of taking the average value of the vegetation structure of each transect to calculate wave attenuation) if the wave crossed through mangroves at a distance of >= 200 m from the seaward side of the mangrove edge. The integration of mangrove structures into the established empirical models improves our understanding of the nonlinear wave attenuation function of mangroves and may provide decision makers with more valuable information on restoring mangrove ecosystems to protect against storm surges.",0,2020,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two recent GBR coral bleaching events (2016-2017) lead to Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) shifting their focus from passive management to active intervention (Great Barrier Reef Blueprint for resilience by GBRMPA). These active interventions, potentially able to increase GBR resilience, as there are reefs that, due to their physical location relative to all other reefs, river and estuary entrances, ocean currents, have favourable coral growth conditions. To undertake such interventions, various information is required including tropical cyclone wave climates. This paper develops tropical cyclone wave climates for the entire GBR. These wave climates were developed by simulating several thousand synthetic cyclones derived from the HadGEM general circulation model with RCP8.5 climate change scenario. The synthetic cyclones adopted herein include the following climate changes assessed by comparing averages of key forcing parameters between 1950 to 1999 and 2050 to 2099. Their average arrival rate increases from 2.25 to 2.41 cyclones/year and their average maximum wind speed increases from 24 to 28 m/s. Their average radius to maximum winds remains constant at 51 km. Two key challenges were resolved, namely, long runtimes and large files (600 m grid increment covering 1800 km by 280 km). Runtimes were reduced by excluding cyclones where their wind speeds over the entire event never exceeded 10 m/s within GBR itself or within 100 km of the GBR over water. Maximum wave heights were compared with an extended fetch empirical expression, which was based on satellite data of tropical cyclones in open waters, when cyclones were outside the GBR lagoon. These comparisons indicate that predicted wave heights have a lower bias using default wave generation parameters when compared with the extended fetch empirical expression. Prediction uncertainty was estimated at no more than 10% from various cyclonic windfield models. The existing GBR reefs reduce nearshore wave or runup height by between 1.5 and 2 times compared to the no reef case. The reduction in wave or runup height was found to be minimal for 1 m sea level rise. These two findings indicate that there is more flooding potential from coral removal than SLR within the GBR lagoon.",2,2020,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W.; Suzuki, T.",Nature-based flood protection: The efficiency of vegetated foreshores for reducing wave loads on coastal dikes,"This paper analyses the effect of vegetation on wave damping under severe storm conditions, based on a combination of field measurements and numerical modelling. The field measurements of wave attenuation by vegetation were performed on two salt marshes with two representative but contrasting coastal wetland vegetation types: cordgrass (Spartina anglica) and grassweed (Scirpus maritimus). The former is found in salty environments, whereas the latter is found in brackish environments. The measurements have added to the range with the highest water depths and wave heights presented in the literature so far. A numerical wave model (SWAN) has been calibrated and validated using the new field data. It appeared that the model was well capable of reproducing the observed decay in wave height over the salt marsh. The model has been applied to compute the reduction of the incident wave height on a dike for various realistic foreshore configurations and hydraulic loading conditions. Additionally, the efficiency of vegetated foreshores in reducing wave loads on the dike has been investigated, where wave loads were quantified using a computed wave run-up height and wave overtopping discharge. The outcomes show that vegetated foreshores reduce wave loads on coastal dikes significantly, also for the large inundation depths that occur during storms and with the vegetation being in winter state. The effect of the foreshore on the wave loads varies with wave height to water depth ratio on the foreshore. The presence of vegetation on the foreshore extends the range of water depths for which a foreshore can be applied for effective reduction of wave loads, and prevents intense wave breaking on the foreshore to occur. This research demonstrates that vegetated foreshores can be considered as a promising supplement to conventional engineering methods for dike reinforcement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, plant species differ in flexibility due to which they interact differently with incoming waves and damp waves to a variable degree. Current wave damping models struggle to balance accuracy against computational costs when accounting for wave-vegetation interactions. Instead, they often rely on a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient, which limits their application across plant species. Here we show, using novel simultaneous experimental data of wave damping, water velocities and stem motion, that wave damping by quasi-flexible cylindrical vegetation is controlled by the relative velocity between water and vegetation at the upright bottom section of a stem. For the quasi-flexible vegetation conditions considered in this manuscript (L > 1.4 and Ca < 700), our experimental evidence justifies the application of a model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to estimate plant motion. Building on the solution of plant motion, we simulate wave damping over flexible vegetation fields through a new work factor. Our model successfully predicts damping of regular waves by rigid and flexible artificial vegetation, and real S. Anglica, P. Maritima and E. Athericus plants in the right order of magnitude under medium and high energy wave conditions. The simulated wave damping is directly linked to vegetation and wave conditions and does not require a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient.

Impacts of climate change, together with population growth and economic development, are expected to exert pressure on these vulnerable systems. In this study the numerical wave-propagation model SWAN-VEG (Simulating Waves Nearshore-Vegetation) was used to simulate the possible impacts of climate change on the wave-dissipation capacity of different types of mangrove vegetation. Vegetation characteristics were assessed in planted plots (Rhizophora apiculata and a mix of R. mucronata, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia alba, and Nypa fructicans) and in natural regenerated areas (A. alba and S. caseolaris) in Thanh Phu Natural Reserve, Mekong Delta, Vietnam; these assessments were used as model input.

We augment the MDO phase-averaged wave model by incorporating a vegetation-drag-induced energy dissipation term into its wave energy balance equation. We adopt an empirical formula from literature to determine the vegetation drag coefficient as a function of environmental conditions. Model evaluation using data from laboratory-scale experiments show that the improved MDO model accurately captures wave height attenuation due to submerged and emergent vegetation. We apply the validated model to Jamaica Bay to quantify the influence of coastal-scale salt marshes on storm waves. It is found that the impact of marsh islands is largest for storms with lower flood levels, due to wave breaking on the marsh island substrate. However, the role of the actual marsh plants, Spartina alterniflora, grows larger for storms with higher flood levels, when wave breaking does not occur and the vegetative drag becomes the main source of energy dissipation. For the latter case, seasonality of marsh height is important; at its maximum height in early fall, S. alterniflora causes twice the reduction as when it is at a shorter height in early summer. The model results also indicate that the vegetation drag coefficient varies 1 order of magnitude in the study area, and suggest exercising extra caution in using a constant drag coefficient in coastal wetlands.",7,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coastal forest is modeled by an array of rigid and vertically surface-piercing cylinders. The homogenization method, i.e. multi-scale perturbation theory, is applied to separate two contrasting physical length scales: the scale characterizing transient waves and the scale representing the diameter of and the spacing among cylinders. Fourier transform is employed so that the free surface elevation and velocity field are solved in the frequency domain. For each harmonic, the flow motion within a unit cell, consisting of one or more cylinders, is obtained by solving the micro-scale boundary-value problem, which is driven by the macro-scale (wavelength scale) pressure gradients. The cell-averaged equations governing the macro-scale wave amplitude spectrum are derived with the consideration of the effects of the cell problem solution. Similar to [1], the macro-scale wave amplitude spectrum is solved numerically with the boundary integral equation method, where a vegetated area is composed of multiple patches of arbitrary shape. Each forest patch can be divided into subzones according to different properties, such as planting pattern and vegetation size. Each subzone is considered as a homogeneous forest region with a constant bulk eddy viscosity determined by the empirical formula suggested in [13]. Once the solutions for wave amplitude spectrum are obtained, the free surface elevation can then be computed from the inverse Fourier transform. A computing program is developed based on the present numerical model. To check the present approach, we investigate several different forest configurations. However, we focus on incident waves with a soliton-like shape. We first re-examine the forest belt case. The numerical model is then checked by available theoretical results along with experimental measurements for two special forest configurations. For a single circular forest, the numerical results compare almost perfectly with the analytical solutions. The comparison with experimental data also shows very good agreements. The effects of different wave parameters on damping rate are discussed. The numerical model is further compared with the experiments for a forest region consisting of multiple circular patches. Good agreements are also observed between the simulated free surface elevations and the experimental measurements. The effectiveness of these two forest configurations on wave attenuation is discussed.",6,2016,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, costly artificial structures such as reinforced walls can substantially diminish the aesthetic value and may cause environmental problems. To quantify the effectiveness of coastal forests in mitigating tsunami waves, an in-house 2-D model TUNA-RP is developed and used to quantify the reduction in wave heights and velocities due to the presence of coastal forests.

Besides the attenuation of sea-swell waves, vegetation may also affect infragravity-band (IG) waves and wave setup. To date, knowledge on the effect of vegetation on IG waves and wave setup is lacking, while they are potentially important parameters for coastal risk assessment. In this study, the storm impact model XBeach is extended with formulations for attenuation of sea-swell and IG waves, and wave setup effects in two modes: the sea-swell wave phase-resolving (nonhydrostatic) and the phase-averaged (surfbeat) mode. In surfbeat mode, a wave shape model is implemented to capture the effect of nonlinear wave-vegetation interaction processes on wave setup. Both modeling modes are verified using data from two flume experiments with mimic vegetation and show good skill in computing the sea-swell and IG wave transformation, and wave setup. In surfbeat mode, the wave setup prediction greatly improves when using the wave shape model, while in nonhydrostatic mode (nonlinear) intrawave effects are directly accounted for. Subsequently, the model is used for a range of coastal geomorphological configurations by varying bed slope and vegetation extent. The results indicate that the effect of wave-vegetation interaction on wave setup may be relevant for a range of typical coastal geomorphological configurations (e.g., relatively steep to gentle slope coasts fronted by vegetation).",25,2016,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The free-surface flow over the vegetation is simulated using a Boussinesq model, while the flow within the canopy is simulated by solving simultaneously a canopy flow model. The parameters of the canopy flow model are related to the geometric characteristics of the vegetation, while the drag coefficient is taken from existing formulas found in literature and is related to the Reynolds number. The coupling between the Boussinesq and the canopy flow model is simulated by adding two extra terms, due to vegetation, in the continuity and momentum equations of the Boussinesq model. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with several experimental measurements found in the relevant literature. The advantage of the proposed methodology is based on a nonlinear Boussinesq-type wave model, with wide range of applications for both engineering and scientific purposes, and the use of a canopy flow model with no calibration needed for the model coefficients.

However, chronic reductions of fluvial sediments coupled with accelerated relative sea-level rise have created an environment where approximately half of the Ebro Delta is now vulnerable to flooding impacts. To assess relative sea-level rise (RSLR) mitigation options through marsh restoration within abandoned deltaic rice fields, we established the experimentally restored marshes spanning three years. We used two freshwater input type treatments (riverine irrigation and rice field drainage water) and three water level treatments (10, 20 and 30 cm deep). Our hypotheses were that: (1) vertical accretion and elevation change in oligohaline restored marshes would be primarily controlled by organic contributions under sediment-deficit conditions, and (2) both vertical accretion and elevation change would demonstrate higher rates compared with predicted RSLR in the Ebro Delta (5-8 mm yr(-1)). Vertical accretion had higher mean values in both water type treatments (11.5 and 15.5 mm yr(-1)) than elevation change (9.1 and 8.8 mm yr(-1)). Vertical accretion (but not elevation change) was significantly higher in drainage water treatment receiving greater sediment mineral input, which caused higher surface soil mineral content. Conversely, experimentally restored marshes closer to rice fields in both water type treatments had greater elevation change (11.3 and 17.8 mm yr(-1)) than vertical accretion (8.3 and 15.1 mm yr(-1)) due to higher belowground biomass because of high weed colonization by Paspalum distichum L. These results showed that vertical accretion and elevation change were generally controlled by mineral contribution, although fast growing, ruderal plant species such as P. distichum can play a significant role in marsh elevation via root growth. The results supported the hypothesis that restored marshes using either water type promote marsh elevation gains higher than predicted RSLR at least during the initial marsh development (3 years). This study indicates that the use of agricultural runoff as a primary source of sediment, nutrient, and freshwater is beneficial for marsh restoration projects focused primarily on mitigating RSLR. This research also highlights how nuisance species such as P. distichum can play a key role in mitigating RSLR impacts when inexpensive and effective measures are needed to promote marsh elevation as the primary restoration goal.

In common with the other 'blue carbon' habitats (mangroves and tidal marshes) seagrasses are thought to provide coastal defence and encourage sediment stabilisation and surface elevation. A sophisticated understanding of sediment elevation dynamics in mangroves and tidal marshes has been gained by monitoring a wide range of different sites, located in varying hydrogeomorphological conditions over long periods. In contrast, similar evidence for seagrasses is sparse; the present study is a contribution towards filling this gap. Surface elevation change pins were deployed in four locations, Scotland, Kenya, Tanzania and Saudi Arabia, in both seagrass and unvegetated control plots in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal zone. The presence of seagrass had a highly significant, positive impact on surface elevation at all sites. Combined data from the current work and the literature show an average difference of 31 mm per year in elevation rates between vegetated and unvegetated areas, which emphasizes the important contribution of seagrass in facilitating sediment surface elevation and reducing erosion.

Many studies emphasize the role of above-ground shoots in attenuating waves, enhancing sedimentation and preventing erosion. This raises the question if short-leaved, low density (grazed) seagrass meadows with most of their biomass in belowground tissues can also stabilize sediments. We examined this by combining manipulative field experiments and wave measurements along a typical tropical reef flat where green turtles intensively graze upon the seagrass canopy. We experimentally manipulated wave energy and grazing intensity along a transect perpendicular to the beach, and compared sediment bed level change between vegetated and experimentally created bare plots at three distances from the beach. Our experiments showed that i) even the short-leaved, low-biomass and heavily-grazed seagrass vegetation reduced wave-induced sediment erosion up to threefold, and ii) that erosion was a function of location along the vegetated reef flat. Where other studies stress the importance of the seagrass canopy for shoreline protection, our study on open, low-biomass and heavily grazed seagrass beds strongly suggests that belowground biomass also has a major effect on the immobilization of sediment. These results imply that, compared to shallow unvegetated nearshore reef flats, the presence of a short, low-biomass seagrass meadow maintains a higher bed level, attenuating waves before reaching the beach and hence lowering beach erosion rates. We propose that the sole use of aboveground biomass as a proxy for valuing coastal protection services should be reconsidered.",117,2013,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to rising sea levels using radioisotopes (Pb-210 and Cs-137) to estimate long-term (similar to 100 years) soil accretion rates. We also estimated carbon and nitrogen accumulation rates. We collected soil cores from four transects along the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula of North Carolina, an area experiencing high rates of sea level rise. Transects included four wetland types: forested, transitional between forest and marsh, brackish marsh, and estuarine open water. Of the 16 sites we sampled. we were able to estimate accretion rates for 14 using Pb-210 and four cores using Cs-137. Only one site had a vertical accretion rate higher than the local rate of sea level rise (0.45 cm year(-1)) a transitional wetland site with fine sediment sourced from a nearby canal (0.88 cm year(-1)) Mean vertical accretion across all sites was 0.20 cm year(-1). Our results show that most wetlands in the area are vulnerable to future inundation due to current rates of sea level rise. Extrapolating from our measurement to the entire peninsula suggests that if wetlands have room to migrate and transition from forest to marsh, the potential for sea level rise-induced loss of C and N accumulation will be 2-20%, compared to 35-88% when not accounting for wetland transitions, illustrating the importance of allowing space for wetlands to migrate in these changing landscapes.",0,2021,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constructed model simulated the propagation of tide over an artificial landfill that was subjected to land subsidence, sea-level rise, vegetation growth, and sediment deposition. A case study analysis confirmed that the tidal amplitudes are reduced if the initial elevation of the landfill is appropriately considered to achieve an equilibrium state of the landfill over its lifetime. Sediment deposition may be the only dependable source to sustain the surface elevation of a mangrove with relative sea-level rise. Sediment deposition is important to promote vegetation growth, which in turn contributes to sedimentation by enhancing a tranquil hydrodynamic environment.

Linked SLAMM and XBeach models were used to investigate potential future changes in wave attenuation over a 50-year period in a degrading, subtropical wetland and a prograding, temperate wetland. These contrasting systems also have differing management contexts and were contrasted to demonstrate how the linked models can provide management relevant insights. Morphological development of wetlands for different scenarios of sea level rise and accretion was simulated with SLAMM and then coupled with different vegetation characteristics to predict the influence on future wave attenuation using XBeach. The geomorphological context, subsidence, and accretion resulted in large predicted reductions in the extent of vegetated land (e.g., wetland) and changes in wave height reduction potential across the wetland. These were exacerbated by increases in sea-level from +0.217 m to +0.386 m over a 50-year period, especially at the lowest accretion rates in the degrading wetland. Mangrove vegetation increased wave attenuation within the degrading, subtropical, saline wetland, while grazing reduced wave attenuation in the temperate, prograding wetland. Coastal management decisions and actions, related to coastal vegetation type and structure, have the potential to change future wave attenuation at a spatial scale relevant to coastal protection planning. Therefore, a coastal management approach that includes disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, and climate change, can be informed by coastal modeling tools, such as those demonstrated here for two contrasting case studies.",4,2019,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the interaction between hydrodynamics and seagrass plants, Zostera noltii meadows were exposed to a range of combinations of waves and flow in a flume. Velocity profiles were obtained to observe the evolution of hydrodynamic forcing due to the presence of a seagrass canopy. Observations under flow without waves agreed with those of previous studies and showed that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at the top of the canopy increased with increasing flow velocity as well as with distance from the leading edge. The highest TKE values were achieved for the highest flow velocity without waves, and the presence of waves generally led to reduced TKE values. Profiles of time-averaged downstream velocity were not affected by the presence of waves. However, flow reduction near the bed increased with higher seagrass density, resulting in an S-shaped profile for the highest density and flow velocity. Underlying currents affected wave orbital velocities, causing a reduction of orbital diameters in the free-stream region. In the canopy region, this process was superimposed by the damping effect of the seagrass meadow, but only positive flow components were reduced by seagrass presence. Streamlining and oscillating motion of seagrass leaves were observed under flow and waves, respectively. These processes did not affect the wave/flow attenuation capacity of the meadow, which indicates that the ecosystem-engineering traits of seagrasses are not compromised by increased flow velocity or in the presence of waves.",9,2015,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring the evidence,"Low Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ) are located at less than 10 m above sea level. Because of human encroachment, combined with sea level rise and increased storminess, LECZ are at an increasing risk of flooding and erosion. In consequence, there is a growing need for shoreline protection. Traditionally, hard infrastructure was used, with positive local results, but negative regional impacts when flows were not maintained. Therefore, ecosystem-based coastal protection has been considered as an alternative. We explored the scientific literature to look for evidence that proves the effectiveness of natural ecosystems for protection against flooding and erosion, when these events are a problem to society. We found that although the protective role of vegetation has been mentioned for over 50 years, most of the studies date from the last decade and have been performed in the USA and the Netherlands. Mangroves, saltmarshes and coastal dunes are the ecosystems most frequently studied. The evidence we found includes anecdotal observations, experimental tests, mathematical analyses, models and projections, economic valuations and field observations. Although mostly effective, there are limitations of an ecosystem-based approach and probably, different strategies can be combined so that protection is improved while additional ecosystem services are maintained. We conclude that, besides improving coastal protection strategies, it is fundamental to reduce human pressure by mobilizing populations inland (or at least promoting new developments further inland), and minimizing the negative impact of human activities. We need to be better prepared to deal with the climate change challenges that will affect LECZ in the not very distant future.",15,2017,WoS,,review,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relative role of root traits and environmental factors in controlling sediment stability, and how intraspecific variability of root traits vary within and among marshes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated which root trait(s) drive sediment stability (resistance to lateral erosion) in two marsh species with an important role in coastal protection (Spartina anglica and Atriplex portulacoides) and how the environment affects the expression of these traits. We sampled three marshes along salinity gradients in each of two estuaries in Wales (UK), establishing replicate plots in the respective dominant zones of each species. In all plots we sampled abiotic variables (sand, redox potential, pH, salinity) and root traits (root density, specific root density, root volume, root length density); in a subset of these plots (three per species in each marsh) we extracted soil-plant cores and assessed their erosion resistance in a flume. Sediment stability was enhanced by increases in root density and reductions in sand content. Abiotic variables affected root density in different ways depending on species: in S. anglica, redox was the only significant factor, with a positive, linear effect on root density; in A. portulacoides, redox had a non-linear (U-shaped) effect on root density, while sand had a negative effect. Collectively, these results show that (i) intraspecific variability in root density can influence sediment stability in salt marshes, and (ii) sediment properties not only influence sediment stability directly, but also indirectly via root density. These results shed light on spatial variability in the stability of salt marshes to lateral erosion and suggest that root density should be incorporated into coastal vegetation monitoring programs as an easy-to-measure root trait that links the environment to sediment stability and hence to the function and services provided by marshes.",9,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erosion resistance was also enhanced by Spartina spp. root biomass. In the absence of vegetation, erosion resistance was enhanced by silt content, with mean erosion 72% lower in silty vs. sandy soils. We found no relevant relationships with nutrient status, likely due to overall high nutrient concentrations and low C:N ratios across all sites.

Sundarban delta bordering the head Bay of Bengal is the largest mangrove forest in the world, and the present study reports on inter-seasonal variability of wave damping in presence of mangroves that thrive on a region dominated by seasonal reversing wind field. It aims to understand relative wave attenuation characteristics during a period of one year over this region that experiences a seasonal reversal of wind system. The study considers a multi-scale nested modelling approach to account for distant swells that propagate from Southern Ocean reaching various destinations in the North Indian Ocean region. The model was forced using 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees spatial resolution 6-hourly ECMWF ERA-Interim winds for coarse grid WAM and SWAN runs, and NCDC blended winds with a similar spatial and temporal resolution was used to force SWAN model executed in a flexible unstructured mesh. To avoid model uncertainties of providing wind from two different sources, the wind data of same temporal and spatial resolution has been adopted. The present study quantifies relative rate of wave energy dissipation for monthly and seasonal scales such as pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon periods by analysing characteristic variation of wave parameters and their spectral energy in presence of mangroves. The study has put forth an effort to validate model results against altimeter measurements and ERA-Interim data, as no actual measurements are available to validate model results simulated in the presence of mangroves. This study solely emphasizes on role of reversing wind system on relative wave attenuation characteristics and highlights the importance of a more detailed investigation to ascertain impact of varying vegetation parameters on wave attenuation characteristics.",7,2017,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This attenuation promotes the deposition of suspended sediment, increasing the light available locally to benthic organisms. To elucidate the relationship between small-scale hydrodynamics that occur at the sea floor and the meadow scale effects of seagrass, high resolution velocity profiles were recorded adjacent to the sediment-water interface within a Zostera marina seagrass meadow in South Bay, Virginia. Additionally, instrumentation was deployed across the meadow to seasonally monitor corresponding changes in wave height across the seagrass meadow. Results show that wave height was reduced by 25-49% compared to an adjacent bare site, and by 13-38% compared to an analytical model of wave attenuation over an unvegetated seafloor with the same bathymetry. The greatest attenuation of wave height occurred during the spring and summer when seagrass biomass was greatest, while the lowest attenuation occurred in winter, corresponding to periods of minimal seagrass biomass. Significant wave height attenuation coefficients, alpha(w), calculated for the meadow ranged from alpha(w) = 0.49 in spring to 0.19 during winter, but were highly dependent on wave conditions, with greater alpha w for larger wave heights and longer period waves. Within the seagrass meadow during summer, the highest measured bed shear stress was tau(bed) = 0.034 +/- 0.022 Pa, which occurred during peak wave conditions. This suggests that during high biomass conditions, the bed shear stress rarely exceeds the critical bed shear, tau(crit) = 0.04 Pa necessary to initiate sediment resuspension. This is in contrast to the bare site which showed elevated values of tau(b)(ed) above the critical threshold across all seasons. These findings suggest the seagrass meadow does exert significant control over both wave heights and the hydrodynamic conditions at the sediment-water interface, and this control is due to the attenuation of wave motion by drag induced from the seagrass over the expanse of the meadow.",12,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a detailed bathymetric survey was conducted, revealing a submerged reef bank, measuring 18 km long by 1 km wide, parallel to the coastline with a quasi-horizontal top that varies from 0.5 m to 4 m in depth at low tide. Cluster similarity between 180 reef profiles indicates that in 75% of the area, the reef geometry has a configuration similar to a platform reef, whereas in 25% of the area it resembles a fringing reef. Measurements of wave pressure fluctuations were made at two stations (experiments E1 and E2) across the reef profile. The results indicate that wave height was tidally modulated at both experimental sites. Up to 67% (E1) and 99.9% (E2) of the incident wave height is attenuated by the reef top at low tide. This tidal modulation is most apparent at E2 due to reef geometry. At this location, the reef top is only approximately 0.5 m deep during mean low spring water, and almost all incident waves break on the outer reef edge. At E1, the reef top depth is 4 m, and waves with height ratios smaller than the critical breaking limit are free to pass onto the reef and are primarily attenuated by bottom friction. These results highlight the importance of reef geometry in controlling wave characteristics of the MAR beaches and demonstrate its effect on the morphology of the adjacent coast. Implications of differences in wave attenuation and the level of protection provided by the reefs to the adjacent shoreline are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On land, wave energy is attenuated by gravitation (elevation) and friction (land cover). Tree belts have been promoted as bioshields against wave impact. However, given the lack of quantitative evidence of their performance in such extreme events, tree belts have been criticized for creating a false sense of security. This study used 180 transects perpendicular to over 100 km on the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia to analyze the influence of coastal vegetation, particularly cultivated trees, on the impact of the 2004 tsunami. Satellite imagery; land cover maps; land use characteristics; stem diameter, height, and planting density; and a literature review were used to develop a land cover roughness coefficient accounting for the resistance offered by different land uses to the wave advance. Applying a spatial generalized linear mixed model, we found that while distance to coast was the dominant determinant of impact (casualties and infrastructure damage), the existing coastal vegetation in front of settlements also significantly reduced casualties by an average of 5%. In contrast, dense vegetation behind villages endangered human lives and increased structural damage. Debris carried by the backwash may have contributed to these dissimilar effects of land cover. For sustainable and effective coastal risk management, location of settlements is essential, while the protective potential of coastal vegetation, as determined by its spatial arrangement, should be regarded as an important livelihood provider rather than just as a bioshield.",50,2011,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drag afforded by submerged and emergent vegetation depends, to varying degrees, on the incident forcing, the characteristics of the vegetation field, and the morphology of the individual blades. Recent field and laboratory evidence suggests that blade rigidity is an important, but poorly understood, control on wave attenuation, in which greater flexibility reduces drag and limits wave attenuation. The purpose of this study is to quantify the influence of blade rigidity on the drag coefficient through a laboratory experiment in which wave attenuation is measured through artificial vegetation of varying rigidity over a range of water depths and wave forcing. In general, greater flexibility caused a reduction in the drag coefficient (C (D)), independent of changes in water depth, although the drag would be expected to decrease as the canopy was submerged further. However, the drag coefficient of semi-rigid vegetation that pivots from the base exhibits a more complex relationship with the Reynolds number, with a significant decrease in drag as the vegetation transitions from submergent to emergent in response to the increase in oscillatory velocities at a lower point on the stem. The variation in the drag coefficient among the artificial vegetation data and previously published data from a seagrass meadow exhibits a statistically significant variation with rigidity, calculated as the ratio of Young's modulus and wave forcing. The dependency of the drag coefficient on rigidity provides a means to estimate energy dissipation by vegetation of a given blade morphology using simple design variables.",23,2015,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field surveys were conducted on the eastern coastline of Sri Lanka to investigate which vegetation species are effective against a tsunami and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing Casuarina equisetifolia forests in tsunami mitigation. Open gaps in C equisetifolia forests were identified as a disadvantage, and introduction of a new vegetation belt in front or back of the existing C equisetifolia forest is proposed to reduce the disadvantages of the open gap. Among the many plant species encountered during the field survey, ten species were selected as effective for tsunami disaster mitigation. The selection of appropriate vegetation for the front or back vegetation layer was based on the vegetation thickness per unit area (dN(u)) and breaking moment of each species. A numerical model based on two-dimensional nonlinear long-wave equations was applied to explain the present situation of open gaps in C. equisetifolia forests, and to evaluate the effectiveness of combined vegetation systems. The results of the numerical simulation for existing conditions of C equisetifolia forests revealed that the tsunami force ratio (R = tsunami force with vegetation/tsunami force without vegetation) was 1.4 at the gap exit. The species selected for the front and back vegetation layers were Pandanus odoratissimus and Manilkara hexandra, respectively. A numerical simulation of the modified system revealed that R was reduced to 0.7 in the combined P. odoratissimus and C. equisetifolia system. However, the combination of C. equisetifolia and M. hexandra did not effectively reduce R at the gap exit. Therefore, P. odoratissimus as the front vegetation layer is proposed to reduce the disadvantages of the open gaps in existing C equisetifolia forests. The optimal width of P. odoratissimus (W-1) calculated from the numerical simulation was W-1 = 10 m. R at the exit of a 15-m-wide open gap was 0.8, and therefore the proposed system was appropriate for cases with the highest velocity at the gap exit as well. Establishment of a new front vegetation layer except for open gaps that are essential, such as access roads to the beach, is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the numerical model, a single blade was modeled as a series of rigid plates attached by torsion springs. For the laboratory model, strips of low-density polyethylene were placed in a recirculating wave flume. A new form of the Keulegan-Carpenter number based on the horizontal excursion of the blade tip was found to be an excellent predictor of drag coefficient. An algebraic model for predicting wave attenuation was developed based on the following observations. During the portion of the wave period when the fluid velocities are highest, the blade motion is almost completely arrested and the vast majority of the turbulence production occurs during this time. Turbulence production when the blade is pronated is accurately predicted by the maximum fluid velocity over the wave period. The relative contribution to the total turbulence production over the wave period is determined by the relative strength of the waves and the current. Therefore, using a simple algebraic fit, the total depth-integrated, time-averaged turbulence production can be accurately predicted by two flow parameters: the maximum fluid velocity over the wave period, and a non-dimensional number that compares the wave and current velocities. By fitting the algebraic model to data from a particular site, it can be used to efficiently estimate wave attenuation and drag coefficient in seagrass exposed to waves with a background current.",32,2014,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aerial photos, taken between 1978 and 1994, reveal that marsh habitats, dominated by Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Phragmites communis (L.) Trin., have changed into a swamp habitat, dominated by Kandelia candel (L.) Druce. The coverage area of K. candel has increased from 0.04 ha in 1978 to 20.75 ha in 1994. The Kandelia habitat was more salty and located at a higher ground surface elevation than was the P communis habitat. Variations of the water surface elevation and reduction of the channel conveyance due to increase of the coverage area of K. candel (L.) Druce were also obtained in this study.A horizontal two-dimensional model, TABS-2, was applied in this study to simulate the hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of this estuary wetland. Four cases with different removal ratios show that water surface elevation decreases as the removal ratio increases. When the removal ratio of Kandelia reaches 20%, variations of the water surface elevation in the wetland became insignificant. Significant sediment deposition occurs due to the extensive root network of Kandelia. The average deposition is about 33 mm during a 200-year return period flood event. Removal of Kandelia reduces the sediment deposition rate. When the removal ratio reaches 20%, the reduction in sediment deposition is about 5 mm. Considering the factors of flood protection and sediment deposition, the optimal removal ratio is between 10 and 20%. It also found that mangrove removal improves the ecological restoration of Uca (Thalassuca) Formosensis Rathbun, an endemic species of the fiddler crab in Taiwan. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

They are threatened by predominately anthropogenic activities which are causing their decline in many regions, often converting large continuous meadows into highly fragmented ones with gaps or bare sand interspersed within the meadows. To evaluate the impact fragmentation is having on the meadows' capacity to attenuate waves, the hydrodynamics in four meadows with different fragmentation were studied by measuring wave velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. In our study area, as gap size increases, both the turbulent kinetic energy and wave velocity increase in the center of the gaps. However, although wave attenuation varied between the different fragmentation levels, no clear trend was found for wave attenuation or the level of fragmentation. Simply put, neither wave velocity nor turbulent kinetic energy presented significant trends with the fragmentation levels of the canopy on larger scales. Therefore, within the spatial and temporal limitation of this study, fragmentation on a landscape scale did not affect the hydrodynamics within the gaps. Furthermore, as with hydrodynamics, sedimentation rates also increased with gap size, but did not show differences at the landscape level with the fragmentation levels of the meadows.",0,2020,WoS,,field,CI,COMP,gravity,,,,,Spain,Europe,temperate,Mediterranean,seagrass,Posidonia Oceanica,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,neutral,yes,figure 5,g DW m-2 day-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not suitable indicator for MA

Barnegat Bay is a microtidal lagoon estuary with back-barrier and mainland coastal marshes, whereas Delaware Bay is a micro-mesotidal coastal plain estuary with sediment-rich estuarine marshes. Salt marshes of both estuaries are dominated by Spartina alterrallora. An analysis was performed to characterize marsh hypsometry and tidal flooding characteristics, and a coring study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment accumulation, organic matter accumulation, and vertical accretion using Cs-137 and Pb-210 chronology at nine sites in both estuaries. Mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation rates were significantly higher in Delaware Bay marshes (sediment mean and 1 sigma. 2.57 +/- 2.03 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.65 +/- 0.26 kg m(-2) year(-1)) than in Barnegat Bay (sediment: 0.31 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.29 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) year(-1)), as were rates of accretion (Delaware Bay: 0.79 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1); Barnegat Bay: 0.28 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1)). Regression analysis indicated that marsh accretion rates were positively correlated with rates of sediment and organic accumulation, but the upper limit of accretion was governed by sediment accumulation. Tidal flooding frequency and duration did not correlate with marsh accumulation or accretion rates in either estuary, suggesting that hydroperiod is subordinate to sediment availability in governing rates on 50-100 year time scales. If true, natural and (or) human influences on suspended-sediment production and transport in these estuaries has potential to impact marsh accretionary status and stability, independent of sea-level rise.

A potential characteristic of their resilience property is their complex root systems, which can be highly efficient to dissipate tidal energy. To further understand the key hydrodynamic parameters of mangrove trees, we modeled the rigid mangrove root system with a simplified array of circular cylinders (patch) and presented the simulation of the patch wake structure. Five patch porosities ranging from phi = 86% to 96% (phi = 1- N (d/D)(2)) were considered in numerical simulations with ANSYS Fluent. The complex two-dimensional flow structure of the cylinder wake was captured for various stream wise location including far wake region. In addition, the vorticity, and turbulence intensity contours were computed and analyzed. We compared the wake signature of the patch with a single cylinder of the same diameter. We found that, unlike the canonical cylinder, the vorticity field for the porous patch delays the formation of von Kdrmdn vortex street due to the small vortices in the near wake. An increase in patch porosity gives rise to the delay of vortex street formation and decays the wake vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy. The characteristic of the wake structure behind the patch could be used as guiding reference for coastal protection structures inspired by mangrove roots. Additionally, we present mangrove application in coastal protection.",0,2018,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key question is how tidal flow and sedimentation patterns are affected by the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation loss, as sediment accretion with sea level rise largely affects the potential for marsh recovery. Here, we performed a field study in a macrotidal reed marsh and simulated typical spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation loss by consecutive mowing. For each mowing pattern, the spatial patterns of flow velocities and sedimentation rates were recorded. Our results indicate that initial vegetation loss in inner marsh portions, with an intact vegetation belt alongside channel edges, has limited effect on tidal flows over the marsh. However, subsequent creation of unvegetated corridors connecting the bare inner marsh and the channels increases flow velocities in these corridors but not in remaining vegetation patches. Finally, when all vegetation is removed, sheet flow occurs over the whole marsh instead of concentrated channel flow. Effects on spatial sedimentation patterns are complex and not significant on all measuring locations. Nevertheless, our study indicates that complete vegetation removal results in redistributed sedimentation patterns, with a general tendency of locally reduced sedimentation rates close (< 15 m) to channels and increased sediment supply to inner marshes 15-50 m from channels. Our results highlight that feedbacks between spatial patterns of vegetation loss, tidal sediment transport, and deposition are key to understanding and mitigating risks of marsh loss in face of sea level rise.",0,2020,WoS,,field,CI,COMP,gravity,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,neutral,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,freshwater marsh

This study finds that saltmarshes provided coastal defence from historic Northwest European floods. Global change amplifies coastal flood risks and motivates a paradigm shift towards nature-based coastal defence, where engineered structures are supplemented with coastal wetlands such as saltmarshes. Although experiments and models indicate that such natural defences can attenuate storm waves, there is still limited field evidence on how much they add safety to engineered structures during severe storms. Using well-documented historic data from the 1717 and 1953 flood disasters in Northwest Europe, we show that saltmarshes can reduce both the chance and impact of the breaching of engineered defences. Historic lessons also reveal a key but unrecognized natural flood defence mechanism: saltmarshes lower flood magnitude by confining breach size when engineered defences have failed, which is shown to be highly effective even with long-term sea level rise. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms and benefits of nature-based mitigation of flood hazards, and should stimulate the development of novel safety designs that smartly harness different natural coastal defence functions.",2,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies also neglect the ecogeomorphic feedback process known to accelerate soil building with SLR. Here, an empirical, dynamic model that accounts for the above processes is constructed for the intertidal zone of a mangrove bay in Hainan, China. The model allows us to explore the response of a tide-dominated mangrove forest to different rates of SLR. Rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) data (2015-2018) indicate rather high rates of surface accretion (13.3-57.9 mm yr(-1)) and surface elevation changes (7.9-35.5 mm yr(-1)). Surface accretion and surface elevation change decreased exponentially with increasing ground elevation. Our model showed that SLR (at rates of 4 and 16 mm yr(-1)) would not lead to the loss of mangrove cover but that it could alter mangrove species zonation along the intertidal profile by 2100 due to a rich sediment supply and ecogeomorphic feedback. Importantly, rapid SLR and landward barriers can pose a considerable threat to the high-intertidal community by causing increased inundation of the high-intertidal zone, subsequent shifts in species zones, and the loss of mangrove biological and structural diversity along the intertidal profile. Overall, this study predicts probabilities of habitat suitability for mangrove species under SLR and expands our current understanding of the impacts of SLR on tide-dominated mangrove forests in sediment-rich systems. Incorporation of extensive, long-term RSET data into this kind of dynamic model could contribute to the better prediction of mangrove responses to SLR at large scales in the future.

Measurements were taken over a period of 1,171 days and were compared with those from unplanted controls. Trees at the lowest density showed significantly reduced survival, whilst measures of individual tree growth did not differ among treatments. Rates of surface sediment accretion (means +/- A SE) were 13.0 (+/- 1.3), 10.5 (+/- 0.9), 8.4 (+/- 0.3), 6.9 (+/- 0.5) and 5.7 (+/- 0.3) mm year(-1) at planting densities of 6.96, 3.26, 1.93, 0.95, and 0 (unplanted control) seedlings m(-2), respectively, showing highly significant differences among treatments. Mean (+/- SE) rates of surface elevation change were much lower than rates of accretion at 2.8 (+/- 0.2), 1.6 (+/- 0.1), 1.1 (+/- 0.2), 0.6 (+/- 0.2) and -0.3 (+/- 0.1) mm year(-1) for 6.96, 3.26, 1.93, 0.95, and 0 seedlings m(-2), respectively. All planted treatments accumulated greater nitrogen concentrations in the sediment compared to the unplanted control. Sediment %N was significantly different among densities which suggests one potential causal mechanism for the facilitatory effects observed: high densities of plants potentially contribute to the accretion of greater amounts of nutrient rich sediment. While this potential process needs further research, this study demonstrated how higher densities of mangroves enhance rates of sediment accretion and surface elevation processes that may be crucial in mangrove ecosystem adaptation to sea-level rise. There was no evidence that increasing plant density evoked a trade-off with growth and survival of the planted trees. Rather, facilitatory effects enhanced survival at high densities, suggesting that managers may be able to take advantage of high plantation densities to help mitigate sea-level rise effects by encouraging positive sediment surface elevation.",67,2010,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequent and destructive wave inundation is a primary climate-change hazard that may render atoll islands uninhabitable in the near future. However, limited research has examined the physical vulnerability of atoll islands to future SLR and sparse information are available to implement process-based coastal management on coral reef environments. We utilize a field-verified numerical model capable of resolving all nonlinear wave transformation processes to simulate how future SLR will modify wave dissipation and overtopping on Funafuti Atoll, Tuvalu, accounting for static and accretionary reef adjustment morphologies. Results show that future SLR coupled with a static reef morphology will not only increase shoreline wave energy and overtopping but will fundamentally alter the spectral composition of shoreline energy by decreasing the contemporary influence of low-frequency infragravity waves. Business-as-usual emissions (RCP 8.5) will result in annual wave overtopping on Funafuti Atoll by 2030, with overtopping at high tide under mean wave conditions occurring from 2090. Comparatively, vertical reef accretion in response to SLR will prevent any significant increase in shoreline wave energy and mitigate wave driven flooding volume by 72%. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of how effective future reef accretion can be at mitigating SLR-associated flooding on atoll islands and endorse active reef conservation and restoration for future coastal protection.",27,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have established the nonlinearity of wave attenuation with habitat width, and variation with vegetation type. However, spatial variation in the level of coastal protection has not been quantified on a national scale. Spatial distribution and fine (50 m) scale structure of saltmarsh habitat at a national scale was combined with calculations of wave fetch at a 200 m scale. Effective wave exposure as a result of wave attenuation over habitat was calculated for areas of coastline within 5 km of habitat areas. Effective wave exposure was combined with data layers on building and farmland locations in order to assess relative protection provision. A metric of coastal protection was calculated for the entire coastline of England and Wales, based on the proximity of human infrastructure and farmland. In scaling existing local and regional data on coastal protection to a national level, we may examine how coastal protection varies regionally and provide a criterion for coastal ecosystem managers to select marshes critical for conservation. Our index shows greatest protection of human infrastructure by marshes in the east and south of the UK, where saltmarshes are on relatively open coastlines with nearby built-up areas and agriculture.",0,2020,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, mangrove loss generates vertical erosion and changes in the nearshore profile that can affect wave breaking, whereas changes in vegetation density owing to species composition or disturbances may affect drag dissipation. The aim of this study is to identify local and global geographical control factors of wave attenuation in mangrove environments and to assess the effect of nearshore profile modifications by mangrove loss on wave breaking dissipation. Bottom wave attenuation from breaking and shoaling, the total wave energy attenuation rate, and wave reflection were estimated using modeling, pressure sensors, and reflection coefficients, respectively, at sites with contrasting wave power, bathymetric slope changes, vegetation density, and logging disturbance. Wave breaking changes by mangrove loss were estimated using wave evolution modeling under three successive slope increments by 0.7% in two background mangrove nearshore profiles. The wave energy attenuation rate at the study sites was affected by incident wave height (28-76%), epiphytic oyster presence, vegetation density, tidal inundation (41-55%), and wave reflection from cliffs. The last two variables explained the wave attenuation rate variability at a cliffed study site (61-70%), whereas the last three variables explained the wave attenuation rate variability on a global scale (92%). Wave attenuation rates by vegetation and bottom friction were underestimated (2-59% from global scale data) when wave shoaling was not considered. The wave energy increased or moved further inland in unvegetated scenarios in comparison with vegetated shores. In addition to drag forces, mangroves can promote wave attenuation by inducing friction, wave breaking, and wave reflection from prop-roots epiphytic organisms, shallow nearshore profiles, and cliffed edges, respectively.",0,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the coastal ecological research carried out in India in the light of the tsunami. In addition, we also briefly reviewed the ecological research in other tsunami affected countries in Asia namely Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and Maldives in order to provide a broader perspective of ecological research after tsunami. A basic search in ISI Web of Knowledge using keywords tsunami and India resulted in 127 peer reviewed journal articles, of which 39 articles were pertaining to ecological sciences. In comparison, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and Maldives had, respectively, eight, four, 21 and two articles pertaining to ecology. In India, bioshields received the major share of scientific interest (14 out of 39) while only one study (each) was dedicated to corals, seagrasses, seaweeds and meiofauna, pointing to the paucity of research attention dedicated to these critical ecosystems. We noted that very few interdisciplinary studies looked at linkages between pure/applied sciences and the social sciences in India. In addition, there appears to be little correlation between the limited research that was done and its influence on policy in India. This review points to gap areas in ecological research in India and highlights the lessons learnt from research in other tsunami-affected countries. It also provides guidance on the links between science and policy that are required for effective coastal zone management.",20,2010,WoS,,review,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,ambiguous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equating the divergence of the shoreward energy flux to its dissipation by bottom friction and parameterizating dissipation in terms of the root-mean-square velocity cubed, we find that the wave friction factor, f(w), for this reef is 1.800.07, nearly an order of magnitude larger than values previously found for reefs. We attribute this remarkably high value of f(w) to the complex canopy structure of the reef, which we believe may be characteristic of healthy reefs. This suggests that healthy reefs with high coral cover may provide greater coastal protection than do degraded reefs with low coral cover.",35,2015,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclone Sidr (2007) was one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in Bangladesh causing nearly 10,000 deaths and $1.7 billion damage. During cyclone Sidr, mangrove forests in coastal areas played a crucial role in the mitigation of these deadly effects. Sunderban mangrove; the world's largest mangrove ecosystem with 7900 sq. miles, forms the seaward frontier of the bay and is now facing significant degradation. The Sunderban mangrove ecosystem is increasingly being degraded for a variety of purposes such as agriculture, fishing, farming and settlement. In this study, we evaluate the potential impacts from the degradation of the Sunderban mangrove on storm surge flooding. We evaluate two hypothetical and extreme scenarios: 1) the conversion of the entire mangrove land cover to an estuarine forested wetland; and 2) by considering a full degradation scenario where the entire mangrove is converted to grassland. To quantify the benefits of the mangrove forests to attenuate storm surge in this area, we applied a framework combining a spatial characterization of mangroves vegetation with numerical simulations. Storms surge was calculated using a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) coupled with wave model (SWAN) under a High Performance Computing environment. An unstructured numerical mesh, with 200,000 nodes was developed and validated along with the coupled SWAN + ADCIRC model at six separate locations in the Bangladesh coast using Cyclone Sidr (2007) meteorological inputs. Twenty-seven model simulations were performed considering nine cyclones of different categories to quantify the effects of mangrove degradation on spatial flood inundation and storm surge magnitude. Simulation results showed that, on average, the mangroves degradation to grassland could raise the surge elevation as high as 57% and had a significant impact on increasing the velocity of the flood wave by up to 2730% for category 3 cyclones. In addition, the inundation inland penetration and total flooded area would increase almost 10 km and 18% respectively for low intensity cyclones. Furthermore, these hypothetical scenarios support the importance of the existing Sunderban mangrove in the reduction of surge elevation, velocity, inundation penetration and flooded area. More importantly, it also demonstrates how the continuous degradation of this important ecosystem has the potential to adversely impact the future cyclone induced hazards in the region.

Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, it is unclear how small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (-32.1 +/- 8.4 mm yr(-1) compared with surface elevation changes of +4.2 +/- 1.4 mm yr(-1) in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO2 and CH4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25.3 +/- 7.4 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) (using surface carbon efflux) and 35.6 +/- 76.9 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) (using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between extracting mangrove wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage.",55,2014,WoS,2011,field,CI,COMP,gravity,,,,partial,Kenya,Africa,tropical,Indian Ocean,mangrove,Rhizophora mucronata,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,positive,yes,figure 1,mm year-1,95CI,,,,,,,,,4.2,5,1.4,1.597191412,-32.1,5,8.4,9.583148475,36.3,94.3877551,

A set of experimental conditions were considered in a laboratory flume: three vegetation models (submerged rigid, submerged flexible and emergent rigid), three plant densities (128, 640 and 1280 stems m(-2)) and three wave frequencies (f = 0.8, 1 and 1.4 Hz). The progressive waves followed the second-order Stokes theory in the intermediate depth range. The observations revealed that submerged and emergent rigid vegetation models modified the wave-induced velocities i.e., both mean current and wave velocity. The submerged rigid vegetation model for plant densities higher than 640 plants m(-2) and wave frequency higher than 1 Hz acted akin to a false floor, confining the mean current to above the plant bed. A penetration depth around 2 cm below the top of submerged rigid vegetation was found. For the other runs, the vertical profile of mean current did not present changes with respect to runs without plants. The emergent rigid vegetation model reversed the direction of the induced mean current, with the highest velocity corresponding to the highest plant density. In contrast, the submerged flexible vegetation model had a weak effect on the mean current, with the vertical velocity profile similar to that found in experiments without vegetation. The wave velocities inside the vegetation for the densest submerged rigid vegetation were found to be reduced by 20%, when compared to the wave velocities without vegetation, while in emergent rigid vegetation this reduction was of 45%.

H.",Field-based decadal wave attenuating capacity of combined tidal flats and salt marshes,"Foreshores consisting of both bare tidal flats and vegetated salt marshes are found worldwide and they are well studied for their wave attenuating capacity. However, most studies only focus on the small scale: just some isolated locations in space and only up to several years in time. In order to stimulate the implementation of foreshores serving as reliable coastal defense on a large scale, we need to quantify the decadal wave attenuating capacity of the foreshore on the scale of an estuary. To study this, a unique bathymetrical dataset is analyzed, covering the geometry of the Westerschelde estuary (The Netherlands) over a time-span of 65 years. From this dataset, six study sites were extracted (both sheltered sites and exposed sites to the prevailing wind direction) and divided into transects. This resulted in 36 transects covering the entire foreshore (composed of the bare tidal flat and the vegetated salt marsh). The wave attenuation of all transects under daily conditions (with and without vegetation) and design conditions (i.e. events statistically occurring once every 10,000 years) was modelled. Overall, the spatial variability of the geometry of a single foreshore was observed to be much larger than the temporal variability. Temporal changes in salt marsh width did not follow the variability of the entire foreshore. Both under daily and design conditions, vegetation contributes to decreasing wave energy and decreases the variability of incoming wave energy, thereby decreasing the wave load on the dike. The southern foreshores, sheltered from the prevailing wind direction, were more efficient in wave attenuation than the exposed northern foreshores. A linear relation between marsh width and wave attenuation over a period of 65 years was observed at all marshes. The present study provides insights needed to calculate the length of a salt marsh to obtain a desired minimum wave attenuating capacity.",3,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two types of stand, Pinus radiata D. Don forests and Cupressus macrocarpa Hartw. shelterbelts, appear to have protected coastal areas behind them from the direct impact of the tsunami. The impacts of the horizontal and vertical structures of these coastal forests on the drag forces were analyzed by observing the characteristics of Pinus radiata forests and Cupressus macrocarpa shelterbelts. The stands absorbed the impact of the tsunami without incurring broken stems or uprooted trees due to their diverse horizontal structure, as they contained short trees with various diameters. However, small areas of the stands were damaged by salinity after the tsunami. For this tsunami, which was less than 3 m high, the horizontal and vertical structures of the P. radiata and C. macrocarpa stands provided effective protection for coastal villages since they reduced the velocity and height of the tsunami. A shelterbelt consisting of three rows of C. macrocarpa in front of the tsunami and a P. radiata forest with a density of 11 trees/100 m(2) and a width of > 50 m immediately behind the shelterbelt are suggested as a means of protecting communities along the coastline of the Biobio Region against tsunamis.",5,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Water level data were collected for over 3000 individual time series during a wide range of environmental conditions. At the innermost measurement site, which is located on the horizontal reef flat after the completion of wave breaking, the upper bound of significant and maximum wave heights is limited to less than 40% and 60% of the reef flat water depth, respectively. As with significant wave height, both the shape and energy level of the reef flat spectra are strongly affected by changes in reef nat water depth. For higher tide levels the spectra on the reef flat closely mimic the corresponding incident spectra, However, the attenuation is greater for both lower frequencies and higher-energy portions of the spectra, This causes the reef flat spectra to be broader than those measured windward of the reef. At lower water levels, considerable energy losses due to wave breaking and bottom friction occur. Most of the energy loss comes from the vicinity of the spectral peak, and energy shifts to harmonics of the peak of the spectrum can be seen.",JUN 15 1996,1996,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the buffering effect of mangroves on the coast of Leizhou Bay in the South China Sea under two different climates (normal windy weather and storm). By doing this, we aim to establish the exact wave damping rate due to the presence of mangroves and to study the wave and spectral characteristics of wave energy in the vegetated area. Wave gauges are mounted along a cross-shore transect to monitor the wave conditions during particular time periods. From the data analysis, we found that the recorded maximum significant wave height is 22.3 cm at the outermost station and remarkable wave damping was experienced within the mangrove troops of 100 meters. To evaluate the wave dissipation on the mudflat, an empirical expression is proposed on the basis of the field data. In this way, the net vegetation-induced wave dissipation is quantified separately. The spectral analysis of wave energy shows the modalities of frequency-dependent wave energy dissipation under different weather conditions. From the results, we conclude that the wave height was strictly subjected to the concurrent water depth even under the storm condition. The relative water depth (to the wave height) determined wave generation or dissipation on the mudflat. Despite the existence of dissipation by the mudflat, wave energy was majorly attenuated by the mangrove system.

Defense of shorelines by protection and restoration of wetlands has been invoked as a win-win strategy for humans and nature, yet evidence from field experiments supporting the wetland protection function is uncommon, as is the understanding of its context dependency. Here we provide evidence from field manipulations showing that the loss of wetland vegetation, regardless of disturbance size, increases the rate of erosion on wave-stressed shorelines. Vegetation removal (simulated disturbance) along the edge of salt marshes reveals that loss of wetland plants elevates the rate of lateral erosion and that extensive root systems, rather than aboveground biomass, are primarily responsible for protection against edge erosion in marshes. Meta-analysis further shows that disturbances that generate plant dieoff on salt marsh edges generally hasten edge erosion in coastal marshes and that the erosion protection function of wetlands relates more to lateral than vertical edge-erosional processes and is positively correlated with the amount of below-ground plant biomass lost. Collectively, our findings substantiate a coastal protection paradigm that incorporates preservation of shoreline vegetation, illuminate key context dependencies in this theory, and highlight local disturbances (e.g., oil spills) that kill wetland plants as agents that can accelerate coastal erosion.",14,2019,WoS,,metaanalysis,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, a set of experiments were conducted to investigate the wave attenuation performance using flexible grasses on a submerged slope, and the wave attenuation coefficient for these experiments was calculated for different still water depths, slope and grass configurations. It was found that the slope plays a significant role in wave attenuation. The wave attenuation coefficient increases with increasing relative row number and relative density. For a small relative row number, the two configurations from the slope top to its toe and from the slope toe to its top performed equally to a large extent. For a medium relative row number, the configuration from the slope toe to its top performed more poorly than that from the slope top to its toe; however, it performed better than that from the slope top to its toe for a high relative row number. With a single row of grasses close to the slope top from the slope toe, the wave attenuation coefficient shows double peaks. With increasing grass rows or still water depth, the grass location corresponding to the maximum wave attenuation coefficient is close to the slope top. The dimensional analysis and the least square method were used to derive an empirical equation of the wave attenuation coefficient considering the effect of relative density, the slope, the relative row number and the relative location of the middle row, and the equation was validated to experimental data.",2,2017,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mangrove with a complex system consisting leaves, trunks and roots is simplified to the artificial model in the hydraulic experiment and put in an open channel. The water level, current and pressure at front and rear of the model are measured to clarify change of tsunami propagation due to the existence of a mangrove forest. Furthermore, the force act on the model was calculated by using the measured pressure. The drag coefficient, C-D, and the inertia coefficient, C-M, averaged over the model are estimated by using the Morison's equation and separating the experimental data to the quasi-steady and the un-steady flow section. We find that the drag coefficient is proportional to essentially the volume occupied ratio. In the other experimental case, the results of numerical model for the tsunami propagation with the resistance model show good agreement with the measured wave profile at front and rear of the mangrove model, which shows that the effect on Tsunami of mangrove forest could be evaluated quantitatively by the resistance model depending on volume occupation ratio.

The simulated wetland plants were placed on the tops of conically-shaped mounds, such that the laboratory model was dynamically similar to marsh mounds constructed in Dalehite Cove in Galveston Bay, Texas. Three marsh mounds were placed in the three-dimensional wave basin of the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A&M University, with the center of the central wetland mound located in the center of the tank along a plane of symmetry in the alongshore direction. The experiments included two water depths, corresponding to emergent and submerged vegetation, and four wave conditions, typical of wind-driven waves and ocean swell. The wave conditions were designed so that the waves would break on the offshore slope of the wetland mounds, sending a strong swash current through the vegetated patches. Three different spacings between the wetland mounds were tested. To understand the effects of vegetation, all experiments were repeated with and without simulated plants. Measurements were made throughout the nearshore region surrounding the wetland mounds using a dense array of acoustic Doppler velocimeters and capacitance wave gauges. These data were analyzed to quantify the significant wave height, phase average wave field and phase lags, wave energy dissipation over the vegetated patches, mean surfacewater levels, and the near-bottom current field. The significant wave height and energy dissipation results demonstrated that the bathymetry is the dominant mechanism for wave attenuation for this design. The presence of plants primarily increases the rate of wave attenuation through the vegetation and causes a blockage effect on flow through the vegetation. The nearshore circulation is most evident in the water level and velocity data. In the narrowest mound spacing, flow is obstructed in the channel between mounds by the mound slope and forced over the wetlands. The close mound spacing also retains water in the nearshore, resulting in a large setup and lower flows through the channel. As the spacing increases, flow is less obstructed in the channel. This allows for more refraction of waves off the mounds and deflection of flow around the plant patches, yielding higher recirculating flow through the channel between mounds. An optimal balance of unobstructed flow in the channel, wave dissipation over the mounds, and modest setup in the nearshore results when the edge-to-edge plant spacing is equal to the mound base diameter.",4,2015,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 26 m long forest is composed by 135 models built reproducing mature Rhizophora mangrove trees with 24 prop roots. Hydrodynamic conditions are scaled using Froude similarity based on values collected in nature. Regular and random waves are tested and three water depths are considered to account for the influence of variable mangroves frontal area along the vertical. Wave decay analysis highlights the importance of considering the effect of flume bottom and walls friction. Neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove dissipation capacity. It is proven that water depth, and the associated mangroves frontal area, and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves. The slope seaward the forest induces wave shoaling leading to an increase of wave steepness. Accordingly, the exerted forces on the mangroves also increase along the first 3-4 m of the forest. Smaller forces are recorded further into the forest where wave decay formulations fit well to the recorded wave heights. In general, analytical drag forces obtained by using mangrove trees induced damping coefficients compare well to the forces measured within the forest. However, analytical drag forces can lead to overestimations of up to double in some cases. This aspect is very important when experimental results are used to feed numerical or analytical models based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation. These models should be calibrated using, whenever possible, direct force measurements.",5,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Guianas coast is influenced by a succession of mud banks migrating northwestward from the Amazon. Migrating mud banks dissipate waves, partially weld onshore, and lead to coastal progradation, aided by large-scale colonization by mangroves, whereas mangrove-colonized areas between banks (inter-bank areas) are exposed to strong wave action and undergo erosion. On large tracts of this coast, urbanization and farming have led to fragmentation and removal of mangroves, resulting in aggravated shoreline retreat. To highlight this situation, we determined, in a setting where mangroves and backshore freshwater marshes have been converted into rice polders in French Guiana, shoreline change over 38 years (1976-2014) from satellite images and aerial orthophotographs. We also conducted four field experiments between October 2013 and October 2014, comprising topographic and hydrodynamic measurements, to determine mechanisms of retreat. The polder showed persistent retreat, at peak rates of up to -200 m/yr, and no recovery over the 38-year period of monitored change. Notwithstanding high erosion rates, mangrove shorelines show strong resilience, with recovery characterized by massive accretion. Retreat of the polder results in a steep wave-reworked shoreface with a lowered capacity for bank welding onshore and mangrove establishment. Persistent polder erosion is accompanied by the formation of a sandy chenier that retreats landwards at rates largely exceeding those in inter-bank situations. These results show that anthropogenic mangrove removal can durably modify the morphodynamics of muddy shorefaces. This limits the capacity for shoreline recovery and mangrove re-establishment even when there is no sustained long-term deficit in mud supply, as in the case of the Amazon-influenced Guianas coast.

Using a fully nonlinear, Boussinesq propagation model, we examine the buffering capacity of the Great Barrier Reef against tsunamis triggered by several hypothetical sources: a series of far-field, Solomon Islands earthquake sources of various magnitudes (M-w 8.0, M-w 8.5, and M-w 9.0), a submarine landslide source that has previously been documented in the offshore geological record (the Gloria Knolls Slide), and a potential future landslide source (the Noggin Block). We show that overall, the Great Barrier Reef acts as a large-scale regional buffer due to the roughness of coral cover and the complex bathymetric features (i.e. platforms, shoals, terraces, etc.) that corals construct over thousands of years. However, the buffering effect of coral cover is much stronger for tsunamis that are higher in amplitude. When coral cover is removed, the largest earthquake scenario (M-w 9.0) exhibits up to a 31% increase in offshore wave amplitude and estimated run-up. These metrics increase even more for the higher-amplitude landslide scenarios, where they tend to double. These discrepancies can be explained by the higher bed particle velocities incited by higher-amplitude waves, which leads to greater frictional dissipation at a seabed covered by coral. At a site-specific level, shoreline orientation relative to the reef platforms also determines the degree of protectiveness against both types of tsunamis, where areas situated behind broad, shallow, coral-covered platforms benefit the most. Additionally, we find that the platforms, rather than gaps in the offshore reef structure, tend to amplify wave trains through wave focussing when coral cover is removed from simulations. Our findings have implications for future tsunami hazards along the northeastern Australian coastline, particularly as the physiological stressors imposed by anthropogenic climate change further exacerbate coral die-off and reductions in ecosystem complexity. Therefore, areas that experience a protective benefit by the Great Barrier Reef's platforms could be disproportionately more vulnerable in the future.",0,2021,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to simulate the wave and wave-induced current in coastal waters, in this study, an explicit depth-averaged hydrodynamic (HD) model has been dynamically coupled with a wave spectral model (CMS-Wave) by sharing the tide and wave data. The hydrodynamic model is based on the finite volume method; the intercell flux is computed using the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for computing the dry-to-wet interface; the drag force of vegetation is modeled as the sink terms in the momentum equations. An empirical wave energy dissipation term with plant effect has been derived from the wave action balance equation to account for the resistance induced by aquatic vegetation in the CMS-Wave model. The results of the coupling model have been verified using the measured data for the case with wave-tide-vegetation interactions. The results show that the wave height decreases significantly along the wave propagation direction in the presence of vegetation. In the rip channel system, the oblique waves drive a meandering longshore current; it moves from left to right past the cusps with oscillations. In the vegetated region, the wave height is greatly attenuated due to the presence of vegetation, and the radiation stresses are noticeably changed as compared to the region without vegetation. Further, vegetation can affect the spatial distribution of mean velocity in a rip channel system. In the co-exiting environment of tides, waves, and vegetation, the locations of wave breaking and wave-induced radiation stress also vary with the water level of flooding or ebb tide in wetland water, which can also affect the development and evolution of wave-induced current.",3,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The theoretical model solves a full boundary value problem for wave propagation with dissipation for non-uniform mangrove forest and arbitrary water depth. In particular, wave-trunk interaction and wave breaking were found to be the dominant dissipation mechanisms. A modified mild-slope equation including dissipation is applied for wave model over changing water depth within the mangrove forest The non-linear governing equations for wave-trunk interactions are linearised using the concept of stochastic minimalisation. The numerical results of the model are verified and compared with the experimental wave data in Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve, Southern Vietnam. The results for wave height, wave spectrum and wave-induced velocities as well as for the coefficients of transmission and reflection suggest that most of the energy is dissipated within the mangrove forest even at relatively small distance. The effect of wave breaking plays a more important role on wave attenuation in sparse forest, however, it is smaller compared to the effect of wave-trunk interactions in the denser forest.

We present elevation and accretion data from Surface Elevation Table (SET) and feldspar marker horizon sites first established in 2003. The sites were clustered in two areas (East and West) in the central BMC on the eastern edge of the Mississippi delta. Accretion markers were used in conjunction with elevation measurements to calculate shallow subsidence. These data were analyzed along with similar data from nearby Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) sites located around the periphery of the BMC. Elevation decreased at the Western sites by -0.35 +/- 0.13 cm/yr, and increased at the Eastern and CRMS sites by 0.40 +/- 0.03 cm/yr and 0.72 +/- 0.09 cm/yr, respectively. The rate of accretion was similar at the Western (0.49 +/- 0.14 cm/yr) and Eastern (0.64 +/- 0.07 cm/yr) sites, and over twice as much (1.30 +/- 0.11 cm/yr) at the CRMS sites. Shallow subsidence, calculated as the difference between vertical accretion and surface elevation change, was 0.76 +/- 0.49 cm/yr at the Western sites, 0.23 + 0.06 cm/yr at the Eastern sites, and 0.58 +/- 0.11 cm/yr at the CRMS sites. These trends are consistent with the observation that sediment is brought in from Chandeleur Sound to the east and is attenuated as deposition occurs across the landscape from east to west, and that levee flank depressions associated with Bayou La Loutre, an abandoned Mississippi River distributary ridge, are causing locally high subsidence in the Western region. Without intervention, these localized areas of the Western region will be submerged within the next several decades at current rates of elevation loss and eustatic sea-level rise, while the Eastern sites and the wetlands on the periphery of the BMC are likely to keep pace with sea level rise well into the second half of this century.

The experimental conditions spanned relative water depths from near shallow to near deep water waves (0.45 < kh < 1.49) and wave steepness from linear to nonlinear conditions (0.03 < ak < 0.18). The wave height to water depth ratios were in the range 0.12 <H-s/h <0.34, and the Ursell parameter was in the range 2 < Ur < 68. Frictional losses from the sidewall and bottom were measured and removed from the wave attenuation in the vegetated cases to isolate the influence of the vegetation. The normalized wave height attenuation for each case was fit to the decay equation of Dalrymple et al. (1984) to determine the damping factor a, which was then used to calculate the bulk drag coefficient CD. This paper shows that the damping factor is dependent on the wave steepness ak across the range of relative water depths from shallow to deep water and that the damping factor can increase by a factor of two when the wave steepness ak approximately doubles. In turn, this causes the drag coefficient CD to decrease on average by 23%. The drag coefficient can be modeled using the Keulegan Carpenter number using the horizontal orbital wave velocity estimated from linear wave theory as the characteristic velocity scale. Alternatively, the Ursell parameter can be used to parameterize CD to account for the effect of wave nonlinearity, particularly in shallow water, for vegetation of single stem diameter.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 373-377. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Recent research indicated that submerged vegetation located at the sea bottom cause wave attenuation. The ratio of wave attenuation highly depends on the type of vegetation as the morphological and physical features of vegetation determine the water column occupied by the vegetation that would in turn lead to wave attenuation. Therefore, it is hard to agree on a single wave attenuation ratio that covers every species. The aim of this study is to find out wave attenuation and wave energy dissipation ratios specifically for Posidonia oceanica. Posidonia oceanica, known to occupy a high water column, is an endemic seagrass species that exists in the Mediterranean Sea. For attaining this purpose, experiments were conducted in a pilot wave flume located at the Hydraulics Laboratory of Istanbul Technical University. 1:10 scaled Posidonia oceanica models were manufactured and artificial seagrass meadow were established on a sandy sloping bottom. Wave heights identified in the vegetated and unvegetated areas were then compared. It is determined that vegetation attenuates wave height and dissipates wave energy. Ratio of wave height under the vegetated and unvegetated conditions varied between 0.78 and 0.94, and it is observed that wave energy dissipation by vegetation varies between 11-40%. In addition, vegetation affects wave height even more as it approaches to the shoreline.",13,2010,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most crops are intolerant of salinity, and minimization of saltwater intrusion is critical to crop preservation. Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including attenuation of storm surges. However, most research studying coastal protection by marshes neglects consideration of subsurface salinization. Here, we use two-dimensional, variable-density, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological models to explore how coastal wetlands affect surface and subsurface salinization due to storm surges. We evaluate how marsh width, surge height, and upland slope impact the magnitude of saltwater intrusion and the effect of marsh migration into farmland on crop yield. Results suggest that along topographically low coastlines subject to storm surges, marsh migration into agricultural fields prolongs the use of fields landward of the marsh while also protecting groundwater quality. Under a storm surge height of 3.0 m above mean sea level or higher and terrestrial slope of 0.1%, marsh migration of 200 and 400 m protects agricultural yield landward of the marsh-farmland interface compared to scenarios without migration, despite the loss of arable land. Economic calculations show that the maintained yields with 200 m of marsh migration may benefit farmers financially. However, yields are not maintained with migration widths over 400 m or surge height under 3.0 m above mean sea level. Results highlight the environmental and economic benefits of marsh migration and the need for more robust compensation programs for landowners incorporating coastal wetland development as a management strategy.",1,2021,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inundation model is used to explore the general conditions under which fringing reefs act as coastal buffers against incoming tsunamis. Of particular interest is the response of tsunamis to reefs of varying widths, depths, and roughness, as well as the effects of channels incised in the reef and the focusing effect of embayments. Model simulations for conditions similar to Tutuila, yet simplified to be uniform in the alongshore, suggest that for narrow reefs, less than about 200 m wide, the shoaling owing to shallow water depths over the fringing reef dominates, inducing greater wave heights onshore under some conditions and farther inundation inland. As the reef width increases, wave dissipation through bottom friction begins to dominate and the reef causes the tsunami wave heights to decrease and the tsunami to inundate less far inland. A sensitivity analysis suggests that coral reef roughness is important in determining the manner in which a fringing reef affects tsunami inundation. Smooth reefs are more likely to increase the onshore velocity within the tsunami compared to rough reefs. A larger velocity will likely result in an increased impact of the tsunami on structures and buildings. Simulations developed to explore 2D coastal morphology show that incised channels similar to those found around Tutuila, as well as coastal embayments, also affect tsunami inundation, allowing larger waves to penetrate farther inland. The largest effect is found for channels located within embayments, and for embayments that narrow landward. These simulations suggest that embayments that narrow landward, such as Fagafue Bay on the north side of Tutuila, and that have an incised deep channel, can cause a significant increase in tsunami wave heights, inundation distances, and velocities. Wide embayments, similar in size to Massacre Bay, induce some tsunami amplification, but not as much as for the narrowing embayment.

The effectiveness of coastal vegetation in reducing storm surge has been investigated in this study. This study includes three types of analysis such as satellite image analysis, numerical model simulation and laboratory experiment. In satellite image analysis, two SPOT images are analyzed to investigate the damages caused by the super cyclone SIDR which occured on the 15th of November, 2007. From this analysis it is studied that the densely populated vegetation areas were less damaged than the exposed areas without vegetation barriers. About 3% of the total study area was damaged by the SIDR. A two dimensional hydrodynamic model named Bay of Bengal model was applied for Sandwip island to study the effect of afforestation in reducing storm waves and current speed. Three scenarios of 200m, 400m and 600m distance of vegetation from embankment and two specific points were considered at the east side of Sandwip island. Results show that the water level decreases slightly but the current speed increases significantly as the distance of vegetation barrier increases from the embankment towards the sea. The laboratory experiment shows that the wave height is reduced up to 46% behind the vegetation zone, 43% within the barrier and 41% in front of vegetation for wave period of 1.6 sec when the vegetation barrier is placed at 1m from embankment.

A methodological framework is presented in order to quantify the impact of natural ecosystems in coastal protection and their environmental assessment based on numerical models available in the literature. In addition to the methodology, a study of a typical Caribbean fringing coral reef and its response to different sea level rise and extreme events scenarios was conducted. The contribution of these efforts from a technological and scientific point of view, lies in the integration of different disciplines required to combine the physical properties of hydrodynamic studies with biological factors as an input to provide practical socio-economic and environmental solutions in those regions in which these ecosystems predominate. Furthermore, a numerical modeling tool to study wave energy dissipation, focusing the analysis on the impact of natural ecosystems (coral reefs) on coastal erosion and flooding was implemented. This information will help coastal managers and decision-makers understand the coastal protection services provided by nearshore habitats in order to improve and design new coastal development strategies under global change scenarios.

Location Global mangrove ecosystems. Methods We review four long-standing roles of mangroves: (1) carbon dynamics - export or sink; (2) nursery role; (3) shoreline protection; (4) land-building capacity. The origins of pertinent hypotheses, current understanding and gaps in our knowledge are highlighted with reference to biogeographic, geographic and socio-economic influences. Results The role of mangroves as C sinks needs to be evaluated for a wide range of biogeographic regions and forest conditions. Mangrove C assimilation may be under-estimated because of flawed methodology and scanty data on key components of C dynamics. Peri-urban mangroves may be manipulated to provide local offsets for C emission. The nursery function of mangroves is not ubiquitous but varies with spatio-temporal accessibility. Connectivity and complementarity of mangroves and adjacent habitats enhance their nursery function through trophic relay and ontogenetic migrations. The effectiveness of mangroves for coastal protection depends on factors at landscape/geomorphic to community scales and local/species scales. Shifts in species due to climate change, forest degradation and loss of habitat connectivity may reduce the protective capacity of mangroves. Early views of mangroves as land builders (especially lateral expansion) were questionable. Evidence now indicates that mangroves, once established, directly influence vertical land development by enhancing sedimentation and/or by direct organic contributions to soil volume (peat formation) in some settings. Main conclusions Knowledge of thresholds, spatio-temporal scaling and variability due to geographic, biogeographic and socio-economic settings will improve the management of mangrove ecosystem services. Many drivers respond to global trends in climate change and local changes such as urbanization. While mangroves have traditionally been managed for subsistence, future governance models must involve partnerships between local custodians of mangroves and offsite beneficiaries of the services.",251,2014,WoS,,review,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the total increase in elevation determines if a wetland can keep up with sea level rise, microtopography impacts, inter alia, hydrological patterns, which again drive surface elevation changes. We analyzed the dynamics of surface morphology during the course of one year at five locations along a transect from land (interior zone) to sea (fringe zone) in a coastal Phragmites wetland at the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (Southern Baltic Sea) using a modified Surface-Elevation Table. Landwards this wetland is confined by a dyke while the seaward boundary of the wetland is formed by a micro-cliff. A small strip between the interior and the fringe zone is characterized by small basins (basin zone). Surface elevation changes in the wetland interior are mainly driven by its own productivity. Litter accumulation by the dense Phragmites stands is high, but a combination of high organic sediments and water scarcity led to compaction and counteracted vertical accretion. While the surface elevations of the measurement location in the basin zone and one of the locations in the interior zone remained fairly stable (intra-annual changes<+/- 0.8 mm), the other location in the interior showed a drastic decrease in surface elevation (-3.3 cm year(-1)). This large deviation may have been caused by the high spatial variability of sediment organic matter. The micro-cliff eroded constantly (3.7 cm year(-1)); its steepness and surface roughness increased making it more vulnerable to the forces of the sea. The micro-cliff protects the wetland interior from flooding but at the same time suppresses allogenic sediment input. The simple approach to use freely available water level data to predict morphological changes in the fringe zone did not yield significant model results. However, the strong intra-annual variability in elevation change especially in the fringe zone showed that short-term changes may often mask long-term trends. Although we cannot predict long-term developments from our relatively short-term measurements, our results indicate that wetland evolution in such squeezed environments is threatened. In dyked wetlands sediment supply from the land is suppressed and lateral erosion at the seaward edge leads to marsh retreat. None of the measuring locations is currently keeping up with local sea level rise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A coupled hydrodynamic-marsh model (Hydro-MEM) was applied to both a marine-dominated (Grand Bay, Mississippi) and a mixed fluvial/marine (Weeks Bay, Alabama) system to compute marsh productivity, marsh migration, and potential tidal inundation from the year 2000 to 2100 under four sea level rise scenarios. Characteristics of the estuaries such as geometry, sediment availability, and topography, were compared to understand their role in the dynamic response to sea level rise. The results show that the low sea level rise scenario (20 cm) approximately doubled high-productivity marsh coverage in the marine-dominated estuary by the year 2100 due to an equilibrium between the rates of sea level rise and marsh platform accretion. Under intermediate-low sea level rise (50 cm), high-productivity marsh coverage in the year 2100 increased (doubled in the marine-dominated estuary and a seven-fold increase in the mixed estuary) by expanding into higher lands followed by the creation of interior ponds. The results also indicate that marine-dominated estuaries are vulnerable to collapse as a result of low, relatively uniform topography and lack of sediment sources, whereas mixed estuaries are able to expand due to higher elevations and sediment inputs. The results from the higher sea level rise scenarios (the intermediate-high (120 cm) and high (200 cm)) showed expansion of the bays along with marsh migration to higher land, producing a five-fold increase in wetland coverage for the mixed estuary and virtually no net change for the marine-dominated estuary. Additionally, hurricane storm surge simulations showed that under higher sea level rise scenarios, the marine-dominated estuary demonstrated weaker peak stage attenuation indicating that the marsh's ability to dissipate storm surge is sensitive to productivity changes and bay expansion / marsh loss.",22,2018,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both laboratory flume studies and controlled field experiments, we show that common salt marsh plants do not significantly mitigate the total amount of erosion along a wetland edge. We found that the soil type is the primary variable that influences the lateral erosion rate and although plants do not directly reduce wetland edge erosion, they may do so indirectly via modification of soil parameters. We conclude that coastal vegetation is best-suited to modify and control sedimentary dynamics in response to gradual phenomena like sea-level rise or tidal forces, but is less well-suited to resist punctuated disturbances at the seaward margin of salt marshes, specifically breaking waves.",141,2010,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment from the west coast of India,"Mangroves are believed to stabilize the coastlines by controlling erosion and facilitating sediment deposition. Coastal managers often plant mangroves to counter coastal erosion. The state of Gujarat in West India has planted thousands of hectares of mangroves over the years, and control of coastal erosion has been one of the prime reasons of plantation. This study performed a statistical assessment of the effect of the planted mangroves on the coastline changes in the state from 1990 to 2013. The study utilized geographic information system and remote sensing data to demarcate the areas under erosion and accretion during this period, and then compared these changes with the change in mangrove cover using statistical models. This cross-sectional analysis was conducted at the level of a tehsil, an administrative unit below a district. The results show that mangrove plantation did not decrease erosion, not even after normalizing the coastline changes by the length of the coastline and using controls for physical and anthropogenic features of the tehsils. Tehsils with increased mangrove cover witnessed both increased erosion and accretion, although the latter was much higher.

Projections indicate global degradation of coral reefs due to anthropogenic impacts and climate change will cause a transition to net erosion by mid-century. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the combined effect of all of the processes affecting seafloor accretion and erosion by measuring changes in seafloor elevation and volume for five coral reef ecosystems in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean over the last several decades. Regional-scale mean elevation and volume losses were observed at all five study sites and in 77% of the 60 individual habitats that we examined across all study sites. Mean seafloor elevation losses for whole coral reef ecosystems in our study ranged from -0.09 to -0.8 m, corresponding to net volume losses ranging from 3.4 x 10(6) to 80.5 x 10(6) m(3) for all study sites. Erosion of both coral-dominated substrate and non-coral substrate suggests that the current rate of carbonate production is no longer sufficient to support net accretion of coral reefs or adjacent habitats. We show that regional-scale loss of seafloor elevation and volume has accelerated the rate of relative sea level rise in these regions. Current water depths have increased to levels not predicted until near the year 2100, placing these ecosystems and nearby communities at elevated and accelerating risk to coastal hazards. Our results set a new baseline for projecting future impacts to coastal communities resulting from degradation of coral reef systems and associated losses of natural and socioeconomic resources.",33,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,elevation,sea level rise,,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper investigates the impact of coastal vegetation on shoreline structural vulnerability due to wave runup loading. Using numerical simulation data, the load (base shear) and momentum flux are computed as a function of vegetation characteristics (length and density) for different excitation intensities (wave heights) at the location of a shoreline structure. This information is then used to estimate structural fragility. Motivated by recent reconnaissance data from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, emphasis is placed on the out-of-plane failure of infill masonry walls. Extension to a different structural typology, that of a reinforced concrete frame, is also discussed. Comparisons between different vegetation characteristics and the bare-earth case demonstrate the wave dissipation and reduction of structural fragility (and therefore ultimately vulnerability) achieved when vegetation is present for the investigated case-study structures.

M.",Developing effective vegetation bioshield for tsunami protection,"To elucidate the effectiveness and limitations of coastal vegetation for tsunami protection, the impact of vegetation structure on drag forces was analysed using the observed characteristics of reference tree species. The drag coefficient, including the vertical stand structures of trees, Cd-all, and the vegetation thickness per unit area, dNu (d, reference diameter of trees; Nu, number of trees per unit area), varies greatly with different species. Based on data analyses, dense Casuarina equisetifolia and Pandanus odoratissimus grown in beach sand were found to be especially effective in providing protection from tsunami damage due to their density and complex aerial root structure. The breaking moment of trees was investigated as a function of tree diameter. The breaking moment equation of P. odoratissimus explains well the damage caused to trees by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2006 Java tsunami. Numerical simulation indicates that inertia is the dominant force (99.1%) in comparison with the drag force when a wave front collides with a vegetation face, but while the water depth is very shallow and the total force is 6% of the maximum. Drag resistance is the dominant force in reducing both water depth and current velocity, but inertia resistance is active in reducing current velocity only in front of the vegetation. The breaking condition of trees can be discussed by the drag-force moment alone because when the total moment reaches the maximum, the contribution of the inertia moment is in the range of 0.1-0.3%. Considering the limitations of P. odoratissimus in reducing tsunami water depth and the other roles that coastal vegetation can play in mitigating tsunami-related damage, a forest with two layers in the vertical direction of P. odoratissimus and dense C. equisetifolia was found to be effective for increasing drag and trapping floating debris.",47,2009,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangrove wetlands are also valuable ecosystems for promoting carbon (C) sequestration and storage. However, loss of mangrove wetlands and these ecosystem services are a global concern, prompting the restoration and creation of mangrove wetlands as a potential solution. Here, we investigate soil surface elevation change, and its components, in created mangrove wetlands over a 25 year developmental gradient. All created mangrove wetlands were exceeding current relative sea-level rise rates (2.6 mm yr(-1)), with surface elevation change of 4.2-11.0 mm yr(-1) compared with 1.5-7.2 mm yr(-1) for nearby reference mangroves. While mangrove wetlands store C persistently in roots/soils, storage capacity is most valuable if maintained with future sea-level rise. Through empirical modeling, we discovered that properly designed creation projects may not only yield enhanced C storage, but also can facilitate wetland persistence perennially under current rates of sea-level rise and, for most sites, for over a century with projected medium accelerations in sea-level rise (IPCC RCP 6.0).

However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions - wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of similar to 1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline.

Evidences show coral reefs play a critical role in wave attenuation but relatively little direct connection has been drawn between these effects and impacts on shorelines. Reefs are rarely assessed for their coastal protection service and thus not managed for their infrastructure benefits, while widespread damage and degradation continues. This paper presents a systematic approach to assess the protective role of coral reefs and to examine solutions based on the reef's influence on wave propagation patterns. Portions of the shoreline of Grenville Bay, Grenada, have seen acute shoreline erosion and coastal flooding. This paper (i) analyzes the historical changes in the shoreline and the local marine, (ii) assess the role of coral reefs in shoreline positioning through a shoreline equilibrium model first applied to coral reef environments, and (iii) design and begin implementation of a reef-based solution to reduce erosion and flooding. Coastline changes in the bay over the past 6 decades are analyzed from bathymetry and benthic surveys, historical imagery, historical wave and sea level data and modeling of wave dynamics. The analysis shows that, at present, the healthy and well-developed coral reefs system in the southern bay keeps the shoreline in equilibrium and stable, whereas reef degradation in the northern bay is linked with severe coastal erosion. A comparison of wave energy modeling for past bathymetry indicates that degradation of the coral reefs better explains erosion than changes in climate and historical sea level rise. Using this knowledge on how reefs affect the hydrodynamics, a reef restoration solution is designed and studied to ameliorate the coastal erosion and flooding. A characteristic design provides a modular design that can meet specific engineering, ecological and implementation criteria. Four pilot units were implemented in 2015 and are currently being fieldtested. This paper presents one of the few existing examples available to date of a reef restoration project designed and engineered to deliver risk reduction benefits. The case study shows how engineering and ecology can work together in community-based adaptation. Our findings are particularly important for Small Island States on the front lines of climate change, who have the most to gain from protecting and managing coral reefs as coastal infrastructure.

The predicted warming climate brings to fore the role of these ecosystems in providing protection against stronger typhoons that can result in more devastating waves of greater amplitude. We performed a model simulation of storm generated waves on a Philippine reef, which is located along the path of tropical storms, i.e., at least 10 typhoons on the average pass through the study site yearly. A model to simulate wave propagation was developed using Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) and DELFT3D-WAVE computer simulation software. Scenarios involving local monsoonal wind forcing and storm conditions were simulated. In addition, as climate change may also result to increased relative sea level, a 0.3 m and 1 m rise in sea level scenarios were also used in the wave model simulations. Results showed that the extensive reef system in the site helped dissipate wave energy that in turn reduced wave run-up on land. A significant reduction in wave energy was observed in both climate change, i.e., stronger wind and higher sea level, and non-climate change scenarios. This present study was conducted in a reef whose coral cover is in excellent condition (i.e., 50 to 80% coral cover). Estimates of coral reef growth are in the same order of magnitude as estimates of relative sea level rise based on tide gauge and satellite altimeter data, thus it is possible that the role of reefs in attenuating wave energy may be maintained if coral reef growth can keep up with the change in sea level. Nonetheless, to maintain reef growth, it is imperative to manage coral reef ecosystems sustainably and to eliminate the stressors that are within human control. Minimizing activities such as illegal and destructive blast and poison fishing methods, pollution and siltation, is crucial to minimize the impacts of high-energy waves that may increase with climate change.",11,2012,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
371,,out,out,out,"Sheppard, C; Dixon, DJ; Gourlay, M; Sheppard, A; Payet, R",NA,Coral mortality increases wave energy reaching shores protected by reef flats: Examples from the Seychelles,"In the granitic Seychelles, many shores and beaches are fringed by coral reef flats which provide protection to shores from erosion by waves. The surfaces of these reef flats support a complex ecology. About 10 years ago their seaward zones were extensively covered by a rich coral growth, which reached approximately to mean low water level, but in 1998 this was largely killed by seawater warming. The resulting large expanses of dead coral skeletons in these locations are now disintegrating, and much of the subsequent modest recovery by new coral recruitment was set back by further mortalities. A mathematical model of wave energy reaching shorelines protected by coral reef flats has been applied to 14 Seychelles reefs. It is derived from equations which predict: (1) the raised water level, or wave set-up, on reef flats resulting from wave breaking, which depends upon offshore wave height and period, depth of still water over the reef flat and the reef crest profile, and (2) the decay of energy from reef edge to shoreline that is affected by width of reef flat, surface roughness, sea level rise and 'pseudo-sea level rise' created by increased depth resulting from disintegration of coral colonies. The model treats each reef as one entity, but because biota and zonation on reef flats are not homogenous, all reefs are divided into four zones. In each, cover by both living and dead biota was estimated for calculation of parameters, and then averaged to obtain input data for the model. All possible biological factors were taken into account, such as the ability of seagrass beds to grow upwards to match expected sea level rise, reduction in height of the reef flat in relation to sea level as zones of dead corals decay, and the observed 'rounding' of reef crests as erosion removes corals from those areas. Estimates were also made of all these factors for a time approximately a decade ago, representing a time before the mass coral mortality, and for approximately a decade in the future when the observed rapid state of dead coral colony disintegration is assumed to have reached an end point. Results of increased energy over the past decade explain observations of erosion in some sites in the Seychelles. Most importantly, it is estimated that the rise in energy reaching shores protected by fringing reefs will now accelerate more rapidly, such that the increase expected over the next decade will be approximately double than that seen over the past decade.

As the efficiency of wave dissipation is known to depend on specific vegetation properties, we quantified how these morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of tidal marsh vegetation are, in turn, affected by wave exposure. This was achieved by field measurements at two locations, with contrasting wave exposure, in the brackish part of the Scheldt Estuary (SW Netherlands), where Scirpus maritimus is the dominant pioneer species. Our results show that shoots from more wave-exposed conditions developed significantly shorter and thicker stems than the ones growing in more sheltered conditions. Furthermore, we show that the more exposed shoots are more flexible whereas the shoots growing in more sheltered conditions are stiffer. This may indicate plasticity in response to wave exposure following a stress-avoidance strategy. Increasing stiffness was shown to be related to enhanced biogenic silica and lignin contents of the shoot tissue. These properties might affect the wave-attenuating capacity of the marsh as stiff plants are known to mitigate waves more effectively than flexible ones. However, we also found higher shoot densities on the exposed site, which may partly explain why higher relative wave attenuation rates were found on the exposed site, despite the presence of more flexible individual shoots. This study highlights that the efficiency of wave attenuation by tidal marsh vegetation ultimately depends on mutual interactions between waves and plasticity in morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical plant properties.",17,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard practice of performing these studies for such scenarios is extremely expensive, and it is difficult to change parameters and setups. We presented and validated a computational model for a wave flume that can be used for studies of wave attenuation over flexible vegetation based on the previously developed immersed-structure method for fluid-vegetation interaction, thereby augmenting field and laboratory studies with a more-flexible and less-expensive alternative. The main advantage of this computational framework is that almost all terms are derived from first principles without requiring a large number of empirically determined parameters. A series of computational experiments were performed, and an analysis of the wave attenuation with respect to wave heights, spectra, and energy was conducted.

Only in the past two decades, have people began to understand the complex environmental and biological benefits of these fresh water marshes. Recently, bioengineering techniques have been adapted as an integral functioning part of shore protection schemes. The bioengineering approach makes use of natural methods and materials, not only to provide suitable protection from wave action but also to enhance the environmental conditions at a site, primarily through habitat and species diversification. Constructed wetlands are prime examples of additions to shore protection schemes that provide ancillary benefits such as water quality improvements, provision of a buffer zone, and a rich, biologically diverse sanctuary for terrestrial and aquatic species. The wetland plants, themselves, provide increased erosion resistance of the soil mass in which they are planted and can reduce the wave energy levels reaching the shoreline in their lee.This paper describes certain aspects of a recent study undertaken to examine common Great Lakes emergent shoreline aquatic plants in order to assess their applicability for use in a bio-engineered shore protection scheme. The focus of most wetland studies has been related to biological aspects and to a lesser degree, to their hydrology. Little research has been conducted from a coastal science and engineering perspective, especially with regard to wave exposed shoreline vegetation. The study discussed in this paper consisted of a field investigations carried out over two growing seasons and in which the wave attenuation capabilities of a wetland were evaluated as a function of plant density and type, incident wave climate and time of year.

Establishment of hard infrastructure for tsunami protection is not feasible in developing countries due to its cost-intensive nature. Coastal vegetation can therefore be a feasible alternative for tsunami and general coastal protection in developing countries. This study investigates the effectiveness of current coastal vegetation projects and reports a pilot-scale vegetation project, which provides insights into the management and sustainability of such projects. Thirty-seven establishments of coastal vegetation for tsunami protection were identified for the study from Hambantota to Colombo along the southern coast in Sri Lanka. Evaluation was carried out to assess whether the coastal vegetation establishments fulfilled the planning objectives, such as vegetation alignment to tsunami direction, tree density and tree species, and whether monoculture or mixed species are grown. The study also assessed continuous maintenance and awareness about coastal vegetation, community participation and long-term institutional support from government, nongovernment groups, academic institutions, and other institutions within an integrated framework. Approximately 50% of the sites were found to be effective in terms of fulfilling the above requirements and had reasonable protection against future tsunami-type events. Continuous maintenance is ensured only for 35% of sites with community participation. The survey also revealed the importance of adopting scientific and nonscientific methods of vegetation establishment and selecting appropriate species and structure of vegetation strips for tsunami protection. It is expected that this will lead to the development of coastal vegetation guidelines for local authorities.",29,2010,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide a physical buffer protecting the coastline from erosion and act as sediment traps catching terrestrial sediment, thus preventing smothering of subtidal coral reefs. Coastal development that removes mangrove habitat may impact adjacent nearshore coral reefs through sedimentation and nutrient loading. We examined differences in sediment elevation change between patches of open-coast intact and anthropogenically cleared red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) on the east side of Turneffe Atoll, Belize, to quantify changes following mangrove clearing. Samples were collected over a 24 month period at five study sites, each containing paired intact (+mangrove) and cleared (-mangrove) plots. Five sediment elevation pins were deployed in each plot: behind areas cleared of mangroves (-mangrove) and behind adjacent intact mangroves (+mangrove). Sediment elevation increased at intact mangrove sites (M = +3.83 mm, SE = 0.95) whereas cleared mangrove areas suffered elevation loss (M = -7.30 mm, SE = 3.38). Mangroves inshore of partial or continuous gaps in the adjacent fringing reefs had higher rates of elevation loss (M = -15.05 mm) than mangroves inshore of continuous fringing reefs (M = -1.90 mm). Our findings provide information on potential effects of mangrove clearing and the role of offshore habitat characteristics on coastal sediment trapping and maintenance of sediment elevation by mangroves. With implications for coastline capacity to adjust to sea level rise, these findings are relevant to management of coastal fringing mangrove forests across the Caribbean. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal marsh vegetation is considered, on the one hand, to increase resistance to a landward propagating flood wave, such as a storm surge, and hence to protect against flood disasters. On the other hand, coastal marsh vegetation is dying off at several places around the world due to accelerating sea level rise. Here we present hydrodynamic model simulations of flood attenuation by a tidal marsh, with particular focus on the effects of spatial patterns of vegetation die-off. It is shown that a same percentage of marsh die-off but occurring as different spatial patterns of marsh break-up has largely different effects on flood attenuation. Patches of die-off that are directly connected to tidal channels have a much greater effect on increased landward flood propagation, while a same percentage of marsh die-off, but occurring at inner marsh locations disconnected from tidal channels, has only a minor effect. This implies that a random pattern of up to 50% of marsh die-off still provides a considerable flood attenuating effect. However with increasing percentage of random marsh die-off the flood attenuating effect decreases exponentially, since the chance for vegetation die-off occurring directly adjacent to tidal channels increases. This study demonstrates that tidal marsh die-off, which may increase with ongoing global change, is expected to have non-linear effects on reduced coastal protection against flood waves.

In this study, the capacity of tidal wetlands to locally attenuate peak water levels during storm tides is analyzed using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (TELEMAC2D) for a 3000 ha intertidal marsh (SW Netherlands). Model results indicate that peak water level reduction largely varies between individual flooding events and between different locations in the marsh. Model scenarios with variable dike positions show that attenuation rates can be minimized by blockage and set up of water levels against dikes or other structures confining the marsh size. This blockage only affects peak water level attenuation across wetlands if the duration of the flood wave is long compared to the marsh size. A minimum marsh width of 6-10 km is required to completely avoid blockage effects for the storm tidal cases assessed in this study. If blockage does not affect flood wave propagation, variations in attenuation rates between different locations in the marsh and between tides with varying high water levels can be explained with a single relationship based on the ratio between the water volume on the marsh platform and the total water volume on the platform and in the channels. Attenuation starts to occur when this ratio exceeds 0.2-0.4 and increases from there on up to a maximum of 29 cm/km for a ratio of about 0.85. Furthermore, model scenarios with varying marsh channel depth show that marsh scale attenuation rates increase by up to 4 cm/km if the channel elevation is raised by 0.7 m on average. Conversely, marsh scale attenuation rates decrease by up to 2 cm/km for scenarios in which the channels are lowered by 0.9 m on average. The marsh platform elevation has little effect on the maximum attenuation, but it determines which tides are attenuated. In particular, only overmarsh tides that inundate the platform are attenuated, while undermarsh tides that only flood the marsh channels are not attenuated or even amplified. These findings may assist coastal communities and managers in the optimization of the coastal defense function of tidal wetlands in combination with dikes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering responses to higher water levels can be prohibitively costly. Several recent studies emphasize the potential role of ecosystems in flood protection as adaptive risk reduction measures while also contributing to carbon fixation. Here, we use a conceptual model study to illustrate the built-in adaptive capability of ecosystems to reduce a wide range of wave heights, occurring at different water levels, to a narrower range. Our model shows that wave height of waves running through a forested section is independent of initial height or of water level. Although the underlying phenomenon of non-linear wave attenuation within coastal vegetation is well studied, implications of reducing variability in wave heights for design of ecosystem and levee combinations have not yet been properly outlined. Narrowing the range of wave heights by a vegetation field generates an adaptive levee that is robust to a whole range of external conditions rather than only to a maximum wave height. This feature can substantially reduce costs for retrofitting of levees under changing future wave climates. Thereby, in wave prone areas, inclusion of ecosystems into flood defense schemes constitutes an adaptive and safe alternative to only hard engineered flood risk measures.",13,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed analyses are required to assess wave damping based on the contribution of reef roughness and wave breaking. For this purpose, the CFD (computational fluid dynamics) toolbox OpenFOAM((R)) is applied to simulate the wave energy dissipation process over reefs with explicit accounting for the complexities of coral shape instead of commonly applied parameterized approaches for bottom roughness and wave breaking. Model validation was performed through comparison with field measurements over a reef profile of Tesoro Island in the Colombian Caribbean. Quantitative analysis of wave damping caused by wave breaking and reef roughness was conducted for (1) moderate and extreme wave conditions, (2) smooth and rough seabed configurations and (3) changes in the water depth over the reef crest. Wave height attenuation is found to vary along the reef profile reaching differences of up to 55% between smooth and rough reef surface scenarios, particularly for moderate wave conditions. Wave breaking, high turbulent flows and detachment of undertow currents are among the reef roughness effects on hydrodynamics. The fore-reef terrace and the reef crest are identified as the most critical zones where dissipation takes place. Wave breaking from rough seabeds provides a global wave attenuation of 75.4-94.8%, with the reef roughness alone accounting for 4-14%. Under extreme wave height scenarios, the wave damping from reef roughness is not significant. Further predictions regarding roughness effects on the reef hydrodynamics, wave set-up and undertow currents for moderate and extreme wave climate conditions are also shown. Directions for future research using CFD are presented to address limitations that arise from the limited span-wise domain in our approach that prevents development of large lateral coherent structures.",7,2018,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,coral reef,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case study on incorporating storm protection benefits into Habitat Equivalency Analysis,"Since Hurricane Sandy, there has been heightened attention to increasing the resilience of coastal communities to extreme events, including storm protection provided by coastal ecosystems. Storm protection benefits (SPB) are the ability of ecosystems, including wetlands, reefs, and beaches/dunes, to attenuate waves and storm surge. SPB are a topic of growing interest in the scientific and policy spheres, including discussions of how to incorporate SPB into existing policies. As an engine for restoration and a leading mechanism for the evaluation of ecosystem services, Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) provides a platform for better internalizing this and other services into decision-making particularly using Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA). HEA does not explicitly account for impacts to ecosystem services that flow from one habitat to an adjacent one. This study examines a hypothetical case study of an oil spill that impacts a marsh with resulting impacts on SPB to the adjacent upland forest. To more fully assess these impacts, a nested HEA was developed which accounts for cross-habitat ecosystem service flows. The nested HEA captures the impacts of the marsh loss on the forest due to wave and saltwater intrusion that would not be captured by a traditional HEA. By adapting the HEA approach with a nested HEA, NRDA could quantify direct ecosystem services losses as well as additional cross-service flows between habitats. However, additional data are needed in order to perform a nested HEA, and in the case of SPB, location-specific data likely will be needed to appropriately specify the model.",2,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a number of ecological studies have been conducted to realise this important objective, little information is available regarding the quantification of this land cover change. The role of mangroves as living barriers was under appreciated prior to the 2004 tsunami event. In this paper, we investigate the buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami by employing the methodology developed in our companion paper. We focus more on mangrove distribution patterns in different buffer zones before and after the 2004 tsunami. The presence of mangroves before and after the event was statistically significant for the North (chi(2) = 154.08, p <= 0.001) and Upper South (chi(2) = 62.25, p <= 0.001). We observed positive linear relationships suggesting a loss of mangrove resulted into a gain of barren and sand land cover as a result of a devastating impact from the 2004 tsunami event. There are pockets of inland tsunami inundations and penetrations in the North and Upper-South in part owing to the river mouth profiles and dense mangrove trees. Although the North and Upper South Regions of the study area with large mangrove forest areas suffered slight damages, these regions put up a strong buffer against the tsunami suggesting that mangrove forests play a significant role in shoreline protection.",3,2009,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangroves play a very protective role against some of these coastal hazards. The primary aim of the study was to estimate wave energy attenuation by mangrove vegetation using modeling, and to validate the model results with measurements conducted off Mumbai coast, where a mangrove forest is present. Wave measurements were carried out from 5-8 August 2015 at three locations in a transect normal to the coast using surface-mounted pressure-level sensors in spring tide conditions. The measured data presented wave height attenuation of the order of 52%. Model set-up and sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand the model performance with respect to vegetation parameters. It was observed that wave attenuation increases with an increase in drag coefficient, vegetation density, and stem diameter. For a typical set-up in the Mumbai coastal region having a vegetation density of 0.175 per m(2), stem diameter of 0.3 m, and drag coefficient varying from 0.4 to 1.5, the model reproduced attenuation ranging from 49% to 55%, which matches reasonably well with the measured data.

As such, efforts have increased to replant forests along coasts that are vulnerable to flooding. The leafy canopies, stems, and aboveground root structures of mangroves limit water exchange across a forest, reducing flood amplitudes. The attenuation of long waves in mangroves was measured using cross-shore transects of pressure sensors in two contrasting environments in New Zealand, both characterized by mono-specific cultures of grey mangroves (Avicennia marina) and approximate cross-shore widths of 1 km. The first site, in the Firth of Thames, was characterized by mangrove trees with heights between 0.5 and 3 m, and pneumatophore roots with an average height of 0.2 m, and no substantial tidal drainage channels. Attenuation was measured during storm surge conditions. In this environment, the tidal and surge currents had no alternative pathway than to be forced into the high-drag mangrove vegetation. Observations showed that much of the dissipation occurred at the seaward fringe of the forest, with an average attenuation rate of 0.24 m/km across the forest width. The second site, in Tauranga harbor, was characterized by shorter mangroves between 0.3 and 1.2 m in height and deeply incised drainage channels. No attenuation of the flood tidal wave across the mangrove forest was measurable. Instead, flow preferentially propagated along the unvegetated low-drag channels, reaching the back of the forest much more efficiently than in the Firth of Thames. Our observations from sites with the same vegetation type suggest that mangrove properties are important to long wave dissipation only if water transport through the vegetation is a dominant mechanism of fluid transport. Therefore, realistic predictions of potential coastal protection should be made prior to extensive replanting efforts.",10,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.",Attenuation of Storm Surges by Coastal Mangroves,"The interaction between mangroves and storm surges is explored using an analytical solution. A simplified momentum equation, balancing vegetation drag and pressure gradient, is combined with the continuity equation resulting in a diffusion equation. Assuming a simplified environment, a one-dimensional analytical solution is obtained to predict peak surge level across a forest. The solution accurately reproduces peak water level of a 10-year return period flood event in mangroves in the Firth of Thames, New Zealand, and in Ten Thousand Islands, Florida, during Hurricane Charley. Vegetation properties that determine the capacity of mangroves to reduce surges are forest density and cross-shore extent. Storm characteristicsflood duration and peak water level at the forest fringealso influence surge attenuation. Mangroves are shown to be an effective form of coastal flood protection if forests are sufficiently wide/dense, relative to the surge decay length scale, to restrict water exchange during a storm. Plain Language Summary Storm-driven flooding is a major hazard in low-lying coastal areas. Mangroves have previously been shown to provide effective coastal protection from storm waves. However, there is sparse evidence that mangroves reduce storm surge, which is the temporary increase in water level resulting from the combination of high winds and low atmospheric pressure during a weather event. Here we demonstrate that mangroves can reduce water flow and store water, thus helping to reduce peak surge water levels. We show that if forests are sufficiently wide, water levels within (and landward of) the mangroves are substantially lower than for a scenario in which mangroves are absent. The density of the vegetation, cross-shore extent of the forest, and characteristics of the surge (duration and amplitude) all influence water-level reduction in the forest.",10,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights from Freiston Shore, Lincolnshire, UK","The managed realignment (MR) of flood protection on low-lying coasts, and the creation, or re-creation, of intertidal saltmarsh habitat between old and new, more landward sea defence lines is an intervention designed to help protect coastal infrastructure and communities against the impact of storm waves and surges. However, the effectiveness of such schemes has rarely been proven in the field. Environmental monitoring has generally been limited to the first few years after implementation and has focussed on sediment accretion and surface elevation change, vegetation establishment and habitat utilization, to the neglect of the study of biophysical processes, such as wave energy dissipation and High Water Level (HWL) attenuation. We address this knowledge gap by analysing HWL attenuation rates in saltmarshes from within, and in front of, the open coast MR site of Freiston Shore (Lincolnshire, UK). For this purpose, a suite of 16 pressure transducers was deployed along four sections (two within and two outside the MR) of identical setup to measure water level variations during the highest spring fides of the year 2017. Our results show that for the conditions encountered during the field monitoring period, the capacity of the Freiston Shore MR site to provide HWL attenuation was limited. HWL attenuation rates were significantly higher over the natural saltmarsh (in front of the MR), where HWL attenuation ranged between 0 and 101 cm km(-1) (mean 46 cm km(-1)). Within the MR site, rates varied between - 102 and 160 cm km(-1) (mean(-3) cm km(-1)), with even negative attenuation (i.e. amplification) for about half of the measured tides. We argue that the weak performance of the MR site in terms of HWL attenuation was a result of internal hydrodynamics caused by scheme design and meteorological conditions. The latter may have counteracted the HWL attenuating effect caused by the additional shallow water area provided by the restored saltmarsh.",1,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at assessing the wave energy dissipating function in terms of mangrove structures and determining the necessary thickness of the mangrove forest to reduce the impacts of waves on the Bac Lieu coastal zone, Vietnam. Standard plots with the unit distance of 20 m mangrove were set for each transect, ranging from the seaside edge of mangrove to 100 m distance inland. Properties of mangrove structures were measured at three transects to ensure the representation of the study area. Waves were measured along the transects using wave gauges and characteristics of wave attenuation due to the drag force of one existing mangrove species, Avicennia sp., were analyzed. The density, height and diameter of mangrove trees were found to be distributed relatively evenly, with a slight increase of the number of trees per standard plot from 183 at the seaside edge to 218 at the 100 m distance inland. Regarding mangrove root, while its density was relatively uniform along transects, its height varied significantly. The amplitude of wave in the Bac Lieu coastal zone changed substantially with the tidal phase ranging from 0.09 to 0.22 m. The wave reduction between the seaside edge and 20 in and 100 in distances inland from the edge, respectively, increased from 32 % to 91 %. A number of mangroves characteristics influenced the rate of reduction of wave height per unit distance, most notably the physical structures of mangrove trees, especially their densities. The wave reduction coefficient was positively correlated with the thickness of mangroves (r = 0.96). When the distance of wave energy transmission through mangroves was greater or equal to approximately 76 m, the wave energy reduction reached 80 % or above, which assures the wave energy would not influence the coastal zone. Therefore, in Bac Lieu with dense mangrove trees, a thin hand of mangroves could provide an adequate defense to protect the coastal area in this tidal range under normal wave conditions. However, for the case of storms with high waves and surges, more thickness of mangroves would be required to guarantee the protection function, which should be analyzed in future studies.",0,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simulated water levels and magnitude and extent of maximum inundation agree well with the observed data, whereas the removal of vegetation from the model leads to massive flooding with increased total inundation volume and total inundation area in the highly populated low-lying area behind the Biscayne Bay. Additional simulations show that the surge-wave-inundation buffering capacity of the mangrove forest depends on the vertical structure of the wetted leaf area index, and the frontal leaf area index, . The study demonstrates the capability of CH3D-SWAN in quantifying the role of mangroves in buffering storm surge, wave, and inundation, and demonstrates its potential application for assessing the effectiveness of coastal wetland restoration projects.

Recent investigations have shown that there is a potential flood mitigation benefit to be gained from the presence of marshes. Though the extent of that benefit is not yet clearly defined, prioritizing wetland systems for coastal protection requires a consideration of the interactions between communities at risk of storm surge damage and wetland areas of sufficient spatial scales to reliably attenuate storm surge. Here, a framework is proposed for geospatial characterization of these interactions based on numerical model results and is applied to Virginia's Chesapeake Bay region. Spatial identification of Chesapeake Bay wetlands was derived from four nationally available datasets (National Wetland Inventory, National Land Cover Dataset, Coastal Change Analysis Program, and NOAA's Wetland Potential database). Maps of maximum storm tides for four historical storms were generated based on a coupled hydrodynamic wave model (ADCIRC-SWAN), validated for those storms with a mean root mean square error of 0.44 m. Population information was extracted from US Census block data in FEMA's HAZUS Multi-Hazard geodatabase. Results from geospatial analysis of the relationships between wetland land cover, inundation, and population were used to identify where interactions with coastal populations are relevant for the study area when spatial limitations are considered. Approximately 1160 sq. km of wetlands were inundated by all four storms. Total population present in a range of proximities (200, 400, and 600 m) to flooded wetlands was used as a metric to evaluate the effect of a range of limitations on wetland size (5-50 sq. km) on potential population protected. A high level of uncertainty was seen due to wetland dataset selection (number of standard deviations from the mean ranged from 0.04 to 1.37), owing to high variability in spatial delineation/configuration of wetlands. Applying the framework to the Virginia Chesapeake Bay region yields an index of potential protection based on spatial scale limitations. For example, such an evaluation for wetlands meeting the 5 sq. km limitation (disregarding wetlands < 5 sq. km) indicates that the presence of wetlands offers a potential protection for 3.4 % of the population. An application of the index on a more local scale indicates that the interaction of the flooded wetlands with more populated localities is such that the coastal marshes in Hampton Roads and Gloucester may offer protection to nearby coastal communities. This framework demonstrates that effective surge protection from wetlands and marshes is related to a combination of the incidence of storm surge inundation, proximity to coastal communities, and the relationship of sufficient spatial scales for surge attenuation.",11,2015,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,marsh ,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientists, practitioners and managers must be able to quickly assess flood risk and identify appropriate adaptation and risk reduction measures often with limited data and tools, particularly in developing countries. To inform these decision-making processes, we identify how sensitive flood risk and adaptation analyses are to changes in the resolution of data and models. We further do these comparisons in the context of assess the benefits of an ecosystem-based approach for risk reduction. There is growing interest in these ecosystem-based approaches as cost effective measures for adaptation and risk reduction. We assess flood risks from tropical cyclones and the flood risk reduction benefits provided by mangroves in Pagbilao (the Philippines). Then, we also compare risks and risk reduction (benefits) using different quality data and models, to identify where to invest in in new modeling and data acquisition to improve decision-making. We find that coastal flood risk valuation improves by using high resolution topography and long time series of data on tropical cyclones, while flood reduction benefits of mangroves are better valued by using consistent databases and models along the whole process rather than investing in single measures.",1,2019,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this prediction for Mexico by performing regression models, with two dependent variables: the occurrence of deaths and economic damages, at a state and municipality levels. For each location, the explanatory variables were the Mexican social vulnerability index (which includes socioeconomic aspects, local capacity to prevent and respond to an emergency, and the perception of risk) and land use cover considering different vegetation types. We used the hydrometeorological events that have affected Mexico from 1970 to 2011. Our findings reveal that: (a) hydrometeorological events affect both coastal and inland states, although damages are greater on the coast; (b) the protective role of natural ecosystems only was clear at a municipality level: the presence of mangroves, tropical dry forest and tropical rainforest was related to a significant reduction in the occurrence of casualties. Social vulnerability was positively correlated with the occurrence of deaths. Natural ecosystems, both typically coastal (mangroves) and terrestrial (tropical forests, which are located on the mountain ranges close to the coast) function for storm protection. Thus, their conservation and restoration are effective and sustainable strategies that will help protect and develop the increasingly urbanized coasts.",5,2018,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, practitioners, and academics in the field of coastal flood and erosion risk reduction have been highlighting the flood protection value of natural coastal features for some time. Examples of the implementation of nature-based coastal flood and erosion risk reduction schemes, however, are few and far between and can certainly not (yet) be considered mainstream. One key problem around the implementation of these types of approaches has arguably been the relative lack of perceived scientific certainty around the efficiency with which natural landforms, such as coastal wetlands, reduce wave action on landward lying structures and the persistence of such landforms in an uncertain future. This makes nature-inclusive approaches less attractive to more traditional engineering-only approaches that rely solely on one hard structure with a well-defined impact on waves and a specified design life. Using the example of wave dissipation over coastal wetland surfaces, this paper provides a way forward for an easily applicable scientifically informed assessment of the minimum difference any given wetland makes to wave heights at landward locations. Such a minimum function approach could be rolled out to other ecosystem services provided by natural features and thus allow decision makers and coastal planners to consider nature-inclusive approaches to coastal management with greater confidence.",7,2019,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,blue carbon,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangrove forests fringing the shallow coastal seas of Penang Island and northwest of Peninsular Malaysia have been credited to have played a role in mitigating the tsunami waves. It is therefore relevant to assess the role of mangroves in tsunami mitigation by analytical model and numerical simulations. The role of mangrove forest in reducing tsunami wave energy, heights and velocities are simulated by the incorporation of the Morison Equation to represent friction provided by the mangrove forest for the coasts of Penang. Wave heights and velocities can be reduced in the presence of mangrove. However the degree of reduction varies significantly depending on several factors Such as wave period and wavelength as well as mangrove characteristics including forest widths and density. For a wave of 10 km wavelength, with wave height and velocity of 1.0 m and 1.0 m/s. respectively at the shore without a mangrove forest, then a mangrove forest of 500 m width may provide a reduction ratio for wave height and wave velocity of about 0.55 and 0.50, respectively.

The saltmarshes thus could record the Spartina colonization-driven changes within the sedimentary layers. Based on these ecological and sedimentological changes in sediments, we present a new eco-parametric method to estimate the sedimentation rate for the newly-formed wetlands in the Yancheng Wetland Nature Reserve for Rare Birds, Jiangsu. Sediment cores and satellite imagery were used to identify the thickness of accumulated sediment layers and the time since the Spartina colonization. We defined the original ground on which Spartina alterniflora initially colonized using pigment concentrations, grain size and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic matter (delta C-13) in sediments. We also determined the time mark of the Spartina colonization by examining the Landsat images over 1982-2018 to discriminate the Spartina alterniflora from other native plants and geomorphological features. These two datasets yielded a sedimentation rate of 3.3 cm/yr for Core A and of 9.6 cm/yr for Core B, the latter evidenced by an increase of similar to 0.51 m in the bed level from 2008 to 2014. Combining the Pb-210 dating method, we further estimated the sedimentation rate for the layers beneath the original ground, which was comparable to that of the bare flats in the Jiangsu coast. Even though this new method is only applicable to newly-formed saltmarshes, it helps identify the recent sedimentation events as well as reveal the environmental changes and the evolution of saltmarsh-bare flat systems due to the interplay between vegetation, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. It thus could be an efficient and cost-effective tool for an improved understanding of the response of coastal wetlands to a changing climate/environment.

Coastal wetlands respond to SLR by vertical accretion and landward migration. Wetlands accrete due to their capacity to trap sediments and to incorporate dead leaves, branches, stems and roots into the soil, and they migrate driven by the preferred inundation conditions in terms of salinity and oxygen availability. Accretion and migration strongly interact, and they both depend on water flow and sediment distribution within the wetland, so wetlands under the same external flow and sediment forcing but with different configurations will respond differently to SLR. Analyses of wetland response to SLR that do not incorporate realistic consideration of flow and sediment distribution, like the bathtub approach, are likely to result in poor estimates of wetland resilience. Here, we investigate how accretion and migration processes affect wetland response to SLR using a computational framework that includes all relevant hydrodynamic and sediment transport mechanisms that affect vegetation and landscape dynamics, and it is efficient enough computationally to allow the simulation of long time periods. Our framework incorporates two vegetation species, mangrove and saltmarsh, and accounts for the effects of natural and manmade features like inner channels, embankments and flow constrictions due to culverts. We apply our model to simplified domains that represent four different settings found in coastal wetlands, including a case of a tidal flat free from obstructions or drainage features and three other cases incorporating an inner channel, an embankment with a culvert, and a combination of inner channel, embankment and culvert. We use conditions typical of south-eastern Australia in terms of vegetation, tidal range and sediment load, but we also analyse situations with 3 times the sediment load to assess the potential of biophysical feedbacks to produce increased accretion rates. We find that all wetland settings are unable to cope with SLR and disappear by the end of the century, even for the case of increased sediment load. Wetlands with good drainage that improves tidal flushing are more resilient than wetlands with obstacles that result in tidal attenuation and can delay wetland submergence by 20 years.

To better understand the role of fringing reefs in the mitigation of a tsunami hazard, laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume to study the transformation and run-up of tsunami-like solitary waves over various fringing reef profiles. The effects of incident wave height, reef-flat submergence, lagoon width and reef surface roughness were examined. Cylinder arrays were employed to create artificial roughness elements on the reef surface. Empirical formulas based on the experimental data were also proposed for the wave run-up. The ratio of the reef flat submergence to the incident wave height was always found to be the dominant parameter to characterize the wave run-ups over various tested reef profiles. Subsequently, a numerical model based on the improved Boussinesq equations including the drag effect of roughness elements was validated by the experimental data.

The model was enhanced to account for cohesive sediment erosion and deposition, sediment transport, combined wave and current shear stresses, and seagrass effects on drag. Expressions for seagrass drag as a function of seagrass shoot density and canopy height were derived from published flume studies of model vegetation. The predicted reduction of volume flux for steady flow through a bed agreed reasonably well with a separate flume study. Predicted wave attenuation qualitatively captured seasonal patterns observed in the field: wave attenuation peaked during the flowering season and decreased as shoot density and canopy height decreased. Model scenarios with idealized bathymetries demonstrated that, when wave orbital velocities and the seagrass canopy interact, increasing seagrass bed width in the direction of wave propagation results in higher wave attenuation, and increasing incoming wave height results in higher relative wave attenuation. The model also predicted lower skin friction, reduced erosion rates, and higher bottom sediment accumulation within and behind the bed. Reduced erosion rates within seagrass beds have been reported, but reductions in stress behind the bed require further studies for verification. Model results suggest that the mechanism of sediment trapping by seagrass beds is more complex than reduced erosion rates alone; it also requires suspended sediment sources outside of the bed and horizontal transport into the bed.",07-Apr,2007,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, more countries have started to replant mangroves for coastal protection. Extensive researches have been carried out to study the performance of mangrove forests in wave reduction. However, the quantitative effects of mangrove vegetation characteristics are still poorly understood. Hence, this study aimed to quantify the wave height reduction with various mangrove densities as well as to study the influence of tree arrangements on wave reduction. The laboratory experiments were conducted in a narrow wave flume using artificial mangrove models. The results showed that the wave height reduction in area with mangroves was about two times larger compared to that in bare land. The wave reduction difference between tandem and staggered arrangements of trees was less than 10 %. It is also found that the 80 m wide Rhizophora forest is sufficient to reduce wave height by 80 %.

The effects of vegetation to coastal morphodynamics have been of primary interest for decades, because of their role in coastal protection and ecological environment. The damping of wave and impact of beach evolution are the two significant contributions on emerged vegetation. However, the laboratory study of tsunami erosion and deposition under protection of coastal vegetation was less understood compared to tsunami run-up and tsunami inundation. A set of laboratory experiments were reported in this study on changes of size-selective sandy beach profile under the protection of rigid emergent vegetation. The total of fifteen experiments was carried out in a wave flume including two initial profiles (with vegetation and none vegetation), three different wave conditions and four forest densities. The experiments show that rigid emergent vegetation changes the depth and location of tsunami deposition and erosion in sandy beach. The dimensionless numbers were derived to characterize the cross-shore beach profile response under the protection of rigid emergent vegetation. These parameters were written as a dimensionless group, and based upon this present experimental datum, the empirical equations were developed. The study reveals the internal connection among tsunami deposition and erosion, wave height and forest density. The findings of this study have the potential to assist the tsunami hazards prevention and mitigation.",2,2018,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the wave damping performance of mangrove forest of different forest widths is systematically tested in Twin Wave Flumes (without and with the forest model in 1- and 2m-wide wave flumes, respectively) for both regular and irregular waves. Results reveal that the dissipation coefficient increases with increasing forest width and is strongly related to the transmission coefficient as the contribution of the forest itself to wave reflection is negligibly small. The results also show that an increasing incident wave height causes the transmission coefficient to decrease due to stronger wave breaking. The wave energy dissipation through mangrove forest is also investigated theoretically and demonstrates a good agreement with the experimental results.",2,2018,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study a specific mangrove species was selected and its wave attenuation characteristics were studied with the help of scaled physical models under controlled wave and vegetation conditions in a laboratory wave flume. The plant was initially identified as Rhizophora Mucronata and the scaled models prepared had the same biomechanical properties as that of the parent plant. Effect of root soil was incorporated in scaled models as bottom friction. Wave heights were measured after the forest models to evaluate the wave attenuation. It was found that wave heights were following the exponential decay equation of Kobayashi et al. (1993) except for the cases which have incorporated bottom friction. For such cases exponential decay equation was modified by incorporating a new parameter 'd/D-50'. Drag coefficients (C-D), characteristic of the species were also determined without incorporating and with incorporating the effect of bottom friction of root soil. It is seen that drag coefficients are following an inverse relation with non-dimensional numbers (R-e and KC). Empirical relations were developed between C-D and a modified Keulegan Carpenter number (modified considering mangrove root submergence and mean particle size) for predicting the drag coefficients specific to Rhizophora Mucronata species for a variety of wave and water level conditions.",0,2021,WoS,,lab,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. Methods Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. Key Results At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 % greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. Conclusions We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.",3,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,kelp,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the protection offered by coastal vegetation like mangroves to the people, property and physical landscape was also recognized and prioritized by both public and private authorities at various governance levels. As more than 90% of the Sri Lankan coastline is vulnerable to water-related impacts and existing bioshields like mangroves are potentially able to protect less than one-third of it, if at all they are in good condition, an attempt was made to build knowledge on the other potential natural barriers along the coast. In this context, a ca. 2 km belt of the entire coast was digitized, classified and assessed for vulnerability in relation to the existing land- use/cover. First, a visually interpreted land-use/cover map comprising 16 classes was developed using Google Earth imagery (Landsat-5, 2003). Second, based on the Global Digital Elevation Model data from the ASTER satellite, the land-use/cover map was further re-classified for elevation demarcation into waterless, run-up and flooded areas. And finally, both vulnerable and less vulnerable areas were identified by taking into account the average wave heights that the 2004 tsunami reached in the country (North: 5.5 m, South: 7 m, East: 5 m and West: 3.75 m). Among the selected areas studied, Jaffna and Kaluvanchikudy-Komari are found to be vulnerable and, Trincomalee, Yala and Puttalam are less vulnerable. While vulnerability was largely associated with the conditions devoid of natural barriers, the less vulnerable areas had mangroves, Casuarina, dense vegetation and/or sand dunes as land cover, all of which might prove effective against ocean surges. However, these land cover types should never be considered as providing full protection against the type of threats that can be expected. As the present study provides only baseline information on island-wide vulnerability of areas to water-related impacts, further investigation and validation along similar research lines are needed to establish a blueprint for future preparedness.

Among issues pertinent to this question is how it is related to mangroves. Using high-resolution satellite images, we compared the width of the mangrove belt fringing the shoreline in 2012 to shoreline change (advance, retreat) between 2003 and 2012 for 3687 cross-shore transects, spaced 100 m apart, and thus covering nearly 370 km of delta shoreline bearing mangroves. The results show no significant relationships. We infer from this that, once erosion sets in following sustained deficient mud supply to the coast, the rate of shoreline change is independent of the width of the mangrove belt. Numerous studies have shown that: (1) mangroves promote coastal accretion where fine-grained sediment supply is adequate, (2) a large and healthy belt of fringing mangroves can efficiently protect a shoreline by inducing more efficient dissipation of wave energy than a narrower fringe, and (3) mangrove removal contributes to the aggravation of ongoing shoreline erosion. We fully concur, but draw attention to the fact that mangroves cannot accomplish their land-building and coastal protection roles under conditions of a failing sediment supply and prevailing erosion. Ignoring these overarching conditions implies that high expectations from mangroves in protecting and/or stabilizing the Mekong delta shoreline, and eroding shorelines elsewhere, will meet with disappointment. Among these false expectations are: (1) a large and healthy mangrove fringe is sufficient to stabilize the (eroding) shoreline, (2) a reduction in the width of a large mangrove fringe to the benefit of other activities, such as shrimp-farming, is not deleterious to the shoreline position, and (3) the effects of human-induced reductions in sediment supply to the coast can be offset by a large belt of fringing mangroves.",9,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution.

The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest.

Mangroves have been observed in field studies, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to offer some degree of protection from tsunamis and hurricanes. The magnitude of energy reduction strongly depends on three major factors, namely mangrove structures, topography-bathymetric features and wave characteristics. Mangroves are vulnerable and resilient to a variety of coastal disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic. Their vulnerability and resilience depend on the intensity, duration and frequency of the disturbances. Tsunamis and hurricanes are infrequent disturbances of high intensity and short duration. Sea-level rise and mangrove deforestation, on the other hand, are chronic events that evolve gradually over a longer period. A relentless government-community campaign is needed to cultivate awareness and education regarding the vulnerability of mangroves and their invaluable ecological services.

Such a failure could trigger dam-break tsunami-type flooding, or dyke-break-induced tsunami, a possibility which has so far been overlooked in the field of coastal disaster science and management. To analyse the potential consequences of one such flooding event caused by a dyke failure, a hydrodynamic model was constructed based on the authors' field surveys of a vulnerable coastal location in Jakarta, Indonesia. In a 2 m land subsidence scenario - which is expected to take place in the study area after only about 10-20 years - the model results show that the floodwaters rapidly rise to a height of nearly 3 m, resembling the flooding pattern of earthquake-induced tsunamis. The depth-velocity product criterion suggests that many of the narrow pedestrian paths behind the dyke could experience strong flows, which are far greater than the safe limits that would allow pedestrian evacuation. A couple of alternative scenarios were also considered to investigate how such flood impacts could be mitigated by creating a mangrove belt in front of the dyke as an additional safety measure. The dyke-break-induced tsunamis, which in many areas are far more likely than regular earthquake tsunamis, cannot be overlooked and thus should be considered in disaster management and urban planning along the coasts of many developing countries.",13,2016,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They urgently need protection from erosion, which is being exacerbated by changing climate and coastal development. Traditional coastal engineering solutions are expensive, provide unstable temporary solutions, and often disrupt natural sediment transport. Instead, natural foreshore stabilization and nourishment may provide a sustainable and resilient long-term solution. Field flume and ecosystem process measurements, along with data from the literature, show that sediment stabilization by seagrass in combination with sediment-producing calcifying algae in the foreshore form an effective mechanism for maintaining tropical beaches worldwide. The long-term efficacy of this type of nature-based beach management is shown at a large scale by comparing vegetated and unvegetated coastal profiles. We argue that preserving and restoring vegetated beach foreshore ecosystems offers a viable, self-sustaining alternative to traditional engineering solutions, increasing the resilience of coastal areas to climate change.",16,2019,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,seagrass,,coastal protection,erosion,sea level rise,,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their effects in attenuating wind velocity and providing protection from wind damage during storms are not known. This study examined whether mangroves attenuate damage from cyclonic winds and found that they provide substantial protection to properties, even relatively far away from mangroves and the coast. We devised a theoretical model of wind protection by mangroves and calibrated and applied this model using data from the 1999 cyclone in the Odisha region of India. The model predicted and quantified the actual level of damage reasonably accurately and showed that mangroves reduced wind damage to houses. The wind protection value of mangroves in reducing house damage amounted to approximately US$177 per hectare at 1999 prices. This provides additional evidence of the storm protection ecosystem services that mangroves supply in the region and an additional reason to invest in mangrove ecosystems to provide better adaptability to coastal disasters such as storms.

A modified two-dimensional depth-integrated shallow water model was applied to analyze the tsunami mitigation by the artificial and natural structures at two coastal sites: Misawa, a site with vegetated dune, and Hachinohe, a site with seawall and coastal vegetation. In addition to configuration of the real sites, a few hypothetical cases were tested with alternative arrangements of these structures to identify their contribution towards tsunami mitigation. The numerical results revealed that the vegetated dune in Misawa was the primary reason for the mitigation of the tsunami and that the shape of access roads (straight or crooked) through the vegetation to the coast had a great effect on the variation of flow velocity increment compared to in the absence of vegetation. An asymmetry in the damage to the vegetation was observed at Hachinohe, where the vegetation behind the seawall was undamaged and the vegetation that was not shielded from the seawall was damaged. The simulation results showed that diversion of the tsunami flow by the seawall supported creation of a higher moment (4-2 kNm) of the vegetation compared to the places behind the seawall (less than 0.2 kNm). The actual flow velocity and Froude number of the wave front at the Sendai Plain were calculated from video footage. The average flow velocity 1 km inland was 6.2 m/s, and the corresponding Froude number was ca. 1.14-1.4.

Providing protection against coastal erosion is thus a significant issue and considerable research has been dedicated to the development of shore protection solutions. The importance of coastal vegetation and its role in wave attenuation and coastal protection in this context is still not fully understood. This study focuses on wave attenuation by coastal vegetation. For this purpose, numerical analysis is used to determine whether the vegetation field can be considered as a porous medium and whether a porous media based approach can be applied to describe the flow in a vegetation field. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solver PorousWaveFoam'' in the frame of OpenFOAM, which solves the Volume Averaged Navier-Stokes (VRANS) equations, is used for the simulation of flow in porous media. The model is calibrated and a new equivalent porosity (n(eq)) based on leaf area index (LAI) is developed and implemented in PorousWaveFoam''. The model is validated by various laboratory experiments of wave propagation through rigid vegetation, showing a good agreement between the measured and calculated wave height dissipation. It is concluded that the presented porous media approach performs well in simulating wave attenuation by a rigid vegetation field. Moreover, by using the validated model, it is confirmed that for a given water depth, wave attenuation depends on the plant characteristics (plant density, height and length of vegetation field). A higher density and longer vegetation field leads to higher attenuation rates. Wave attenuation decreases if the submergence ratio increases.",2,2019,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,wind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangrove forests play a unique role in attenuating storm surge during tropical cyclones, MIKE21 FM is an applicable software for simulating cyclones within coastal environments. A hydrodynamic model is used to analyze the attenuating role of the protected area of mangroves between Gheshm Island and Khamir Port mangroves under a realistic conditions by updating the calibrated Manning's coefficient based on the land cover data to incorporate the mangrove effect with modifying bottom friction and characteristics of cyclone Gonu 2007 which is the strongest cyclone recorded in the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf. In this research we measured the maximum surge levels in both scenarios (in situ conditions and the condition which mangrove forest is neglected); maximum storm tide reduction by mangroves (MSTRM) by mangroves and maximum storm tide reduction rate by mangroves (MSTRRM). Also inundation maps are presented aiming to measure the areas rescued from inundation and the areas inundated caused by mangroves. The simulations shows that the minimum and maximum storm tide reduction rate by mangroves are 5.32% and 34.88% respectively.",2,2017,WoS,,model,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,storm,positive,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We modeled the cylinders as physical boundaries rather than approximating them as macro-roughness friction. Our results show that the cylinders provide protection for the areas behind them.

However, little is known about the effects of mangroves with a modest cross-shore thickness (similar to 10-50 m), on flow hydrodynamics and resulting inland pressures and forces on near-coast structures. We constructed a 1:16 geometric-scale physical model of a Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) fringe with modest cross-shore thickness to measure the effects of a mangrove forest's cross-shore thickness on wave attenuation and subsequent load reduction on near-coast structures, idealized during experiments with an array of cubes. Three configurations, one baseline with zero mangroves and two with mangrove cross-shore thicknesses corresponding to prototype-scale forest widths of 8.2 m and 19.0 m, were considered in front of an array of idealized slab-on-grade residential buildings. Transient wave conditions with varying incident parameters (wave amplitude, wave representative time scale, water level/mangrove emergence, and presence of a background current) were considered. Water surface elevations, water velocities, cross-shore forces, and pressures measured near and against the building array indicate that mangroves affected inland flow hydrodynamics and forces. The presence of mangroves was associated with elevated water levels and reduced peak velocities between the mangroves and inland structures. Increasing the mangrove cross-shore thickness reduced the cross-shore force on a structure by 11%-65% compared to the baseline case without mangroves. The force reduction by the mangrove configurations varied with incident wave representative time scale; waves with longer representative time scales required larger cross-shore thicknesses to provide similar force reductions to those observed for shorter waves. Further investigation into a wider range of mangrove crossshore thicknesses, trunk densities, and wave conditions is needed to inform engineering performance of natural and nature-based features for resilient coastal design.",1,2020,WoS,,field,,absolute,,,,,,,,,,mangrove,,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hurricane Irma caused significant damage in the Caribbean islands and Florida Keys. After the storm, the authors developed standardized metrics with which to assess physical damage to natural and artificial shorelines and near-coast residential structures. These metrics were used to collect damage data for 332 shorelines and 262 structures in Key West and Big Pine Key, Florida, during a reconnaissance field study in mid-October 2017. Based on peak environmental conditions extracted from a numerical hindcast of the storm, relationships among hazard intensity, structural damage, and dominant shoreline archetype were investigated. Results indicated that structures located in areas subject to wind speeds greater than 49.2 m/s experienced more severe damage than structures located in areas with lower wind speeds. Mangrove shorelines were identified as resilient to environmental conditions during Hurricane Irma, and mangrove fringes provided protective benefits for nearby structures similar to traditional engineering strategies.

We develop a probabilistic, process-based valuation of the effects of mangroves on averting damages to people and property. We couple spatially-explicit 2-D hydrodynamic analyses with economic models, and find that mangroves provide flood protection benefits exceeding $US 65 billion per year. If mangroves were lost, 15 million more people would be flooded annually across the world. Some of the nations that receive the greatest economic benefits include the USA, China, India and Mexico. Vietnam, India and Bangladesh receive the greatest benefits in terms of people protected. Many (>45) 20-km coastal stretches particularly those near cities receive more than $US 250 million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves.

There is growing understanding of the array of factors that affect the strength or efficacy of these ecosystem services in different locations, as well as management interventions which may restore or enhance such values. Improved understanding and application of such knowledge will form a critical part of coastal adaptation planning, likely reducing the need for expensive engineering options in some locations, and providing a complementary tool in hybrid engineering design. Irrespective of future climate change, coastal hazards already impact countless communities and the appropriate use of ecosystem-based adaptation strategies offers a valuable and effective tool for present-day management. Maintaining and enhancing coastal systems will also support the continued provision of other coastal services, including the provision of food and maintenance of coastal resource dependent livelihoods.

Studies have shown that were coral was mined and gaps appeared that the waves travelled kilometres inland, killing thousands but where the coral reef was left intact the wavestravelled only 50 metres inland. This phenomenon was witnessed before in Nicaragua in 1992 where a tsunami surged 1 kilometre inland through a break in thecoral reef made to let boats through. On a nearby beach where the coral was intact there were still beach umbrellas left standing. There has been a groundswell in Sri Lanka for better enforcement of laws to protect the coral reef andprotect people from further disasters.",AUG 25 2005,2005,WoS,,field,CI,COMP,gravity,,,,,Sri Lanka,Asia,tropical,Indian Ocean,coral reef,mix,coastal protection,wave,wave attenuation,tsunami,positive,no,text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
