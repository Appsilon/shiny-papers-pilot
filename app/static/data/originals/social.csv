A systematic map,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,,"Background: Conservation activities and natural resource management interventions have often aimed to tackle the dual challenge of improving nature conservation and human well-being. However, there is concern over the extent to which this dual goal has been achieved, and an increasing recognition of trade-offs and synergies within and between aspects of each of the goals. The amount and scope of the available evidence on the success of conservation and management interventions in both arenas has lacked documentation, for a number of reasons, including limited resources for monitoring and evaluation and the difficulty in bringing together a disparate evidence base. This systematic map focuses on the interaction between marine conservation management and the health and well-being of coastal communities in South East Asia. Method: We searched bibliographic databases to find published literature, and identified grey literature through institutional and organisational website searches and key stakeholders. Eligibility criteria were applied in two stages, title and abstract and full text, with consistency checks. We extracted meta -data on the design and characteristics of each study, from which we produced an interactive database and map, and a narrative summary. Results: We assessed 42,894 records at title and abstract from the main searches. 1,331 articles were assessed at full text (30 articles were not retrievable). 287 articles (281 studies) were included in the systematic map. Most studies were peer-reviewed publications (90%), and from the Philippines and Indonesia (72%). 31% of studies were solely qualitative, 45% were solely quantitative and 24% included both qualitative and quantitative research. Only 24% (31/127) of quantitative studies included a comparator. We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between the marine conservation interventions: Site Protection, Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives, or Habitat Management, and the human health and well-being outcomes: Economic Living Standards, Governance and Empowerment, or Social Relations. In addition, qualitative research clusters were identified exploring the links between the intervention Habitat Management, and the outcome Governance and Empowerment, and between the intervention Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives, and the outcomes of Governance and Empowerment, and Social Relations. We identified major knowledge gaps in evidence for the effect of marine conservation interventions on the outcomes Freedom of Choice and Action, Security and Safety, Subjective Well-being, Health, and Culture and Spirituality. There was a lack of studies involving Education, Awareness and Activism interventions that reported any human health and well-being outcomes. Conclusion: We present the first updatable, interrogable and comprehensive evidence map on this topic for South East Asia. Our work supports further, detailed investigation of knowledge clusters using systematic review and also serves to identify understudied topic areas. The lack of comparative, quantitative studies suggests that future research should include counterfactuals to strengthen the robustness of evidence base. Users of this systematic map should recognise that much evidence may be national or locally specific, and that we did not undertake an assessment of study quality. Thus, when considering implications for policy and decision-making, users should carefully consider the heterogeneity of available evidence and refer to original research articles to gain a full depth of understanding and context.",0,2021,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106397,WOS:000632312100015,systematic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,investigates categories without giving directions or MPA effects,

For this reason, it is important to evaluate the toxic risk from metals derived from fish consumption and to perform a nutritional assessment. We sampled 20 individuals of demersal (Caulolatilus princeps and Mycteroperca olfax) and pelagic (Thunnus albacares and Seriolella violacea) species. The levels of the toxic elements (Al, B, Ba, Cd, Ni, Pb and Sr), and the macroelements, microelements and trace elements (Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Li, Mn, Mo, Mg, Na, V and Zn) of species muscle tissue were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Demersal species have higher concentrations of Cr, K, Mg and Mo; while pelagic species have higher levels of Zn. M. olfax could potentially cause Cd toxicity so it is recommended not to ingest more than 86 and 73 g of this species (i.e. roughly, one serving) per week for men and women, respectively. None of the species could be marketed in Europe and the USA due to Cd level exceed the allowed limits by EFSA and FAO. Furthermore, the dietary intake of C. princeps is recommended due to its high concentration of Ca, Na, K, Mg and Cr, while T. albacares is recommended for people with Zn deficiency. However, due to the Cd level in C. princeps it is not recommended to ingest more than five servings per week. We attribute the source of metals in the studied fish from the volcanic origin of the islands rather than from human pollution. This is the first study that thoroughly estimate concentration of metals in commercial fish species and its contribution to food security in the Galapagos.",0,2021,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112188,WOS:000634987600006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no social mechanism,

Sustaining this activity represents a universal challenge for the future of mankind. However, the potential influence of anglers? heterogeneity on both the environment and the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE), used internationally to evaluate fish harvest and as a stocks indicator, hinders MRF management. In addition, little data is available on onshore fishing, while the number of practitioners may increase sharply in the context of a socio-economic crisis, especially in marine protected areas (MPA). We conducted a year-round survey in 2017?2018 in a French Mediterranean MPA subject to tourist flows, during which 144 onshore anglers were polled by semi-directive interviews. We used a typology based on technical and socio-economic data of anglers to describe their behaviour diversity and its influence on CPUE and, more broadly, the marine environment in multi-species fisheries. We characterised four onshore angler profiles, segregated in space and time, including one identified as at risk of causing impacts. Our analyses support using total and per species CPUE independently of profiles to evaluate onshore MRF harvest, except for four species. CPUE seem based on the profiles? skills and self-regulation which induce similar yields between anglers in the absence of control. This demonstrates the importance of taking into account angler behaviour, as each profile could react differently to management actions and highlights that CPUE could be used to detect the effect of changes in regulation in the framework of adaptive management. Our results support that MRF regulations should be simplified and homogenised at the national level and cooperation with fishing shops in MPA co management should be promoted.",0,2021,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112089,WOS:000632613900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no social mechanism,

Canada is a signatory nation that has adopted, and exceeded, the UN Aichi biodiversity target to protect 10% of coastal and marine areas through marine protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) by 2020. However, the science of OECMs as contributors to biodiversity conservation is relatively young and their definition and efficacy testing continue to evolve. Here, we examine whether areas closed to fishing on the Scotian Shelf in Atlantic Canada, where the groundfish community had collapsed in the early 1990s, have the potential to serve as OECMs for groundfish recovery. Using long-term research survey data, we show that three long-term area-based fishing fleet closures did not enhance per capita population growth rates of the majority of 24 common groundfish species. At a regional scale, 10 out of 24 species are currently at less than 50% of their pre-collapse (1979-1992) biomass, reflecting a sustained diminished productivity, even though fishing mortality has been drastically reduced through a moratorium in 1993. Additional measures are needed to protect severely depleted groundfish, especially when the causes of continued diminished productivity are still largely unresolved. The importance of OECMs as a risk-averse approach toward sustainability is globally accepted and they can be considered a tool toward the overarching UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-14).

Multi-use (MU) becomes necessary to assemble more or less compatible sea uses. In this paper, the potential of the soft MU involving small-scale fisheries (SSF), tourism, and nature conservation related to marine protected areas (MPAs), widely encountered in the Mediterranean Sea basin, is being assessed in Greece. Despite the fact that the MU concept is not yet included neither in maritime spatial planning (MSP) laws nor in strategic policy documents due mainly to the dominance of terrestrial spatial plans that favor exclusive rights of highly competitive and expansive maritime activities (e.g., aquaculture), the above MU is increasingly being practiced by local communities as a socio-economic instrument (fishing tourism), able to be also occasionally oriented to nature conservation. Following the Drivers, Added Values, Barriers and Negative Impacts (DABI) analysis, a spectrum of challenges/constraints and opportunities for the application of the MU under study was revealed, grouped in socio-economic, environmental, political?regulatory, and technological factors that can enable or undermine this MU in the Greek seas. The paper concludes that there is a huge potential for the said MU development in areas dependent on fisheries, consistently to the longstanding SSF tradition that despite its decline, continues to be one of the most important among those practiced in the coastal zone and in remote and insular communities, essentially defining their particular social and cultural identity. Besides, SSF have low environmental impact, and also tourists and the local communities are gradually becoming more conservation-oriented. Hence, the MU is highlighted as a tool for sustainable use of marine space supporting the Blue Growth Agenda and reconnecting natural and cultural capital at sea, thus redefining also the role of fishers that under equitable conditions may become defenders of marine biodiversity and key actors for the sustainable management of fish stocks and ecosystems in the protected areas.",0,2021,10.3389/fmars.2021.613721,WOS:000635482200001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,narrative but not primary research,

This study makes progress in this direction, describing the most recent advances in marine conservation in Chile and analysing the contribution of the different conservation instruments as well as the distribution of designated areas across ecoregions. Furthermore, it examines the potential contribution of alternative area-based instruments to balance ocean protection. The advances observed in Chile were compared among four South American countries and five leading countries in ocean conservation, analysing protection levels in coastal areas, continental exclusive economic zones, and overseas territories. Data on MPA boundaries and attributes were sourced from the World Database on Protected Areas and complemented the official information on MPAs and territorial user rights for fisheries and for indigenous people in South America. The current level of protection in Chile is among the highest in the world in area coverage and in the proportion of the continental exclusive economic zone assigned to fully protected areas. However, it exhibits the strongest imbalances in the distribution of designated MPAs between coastal and oceanic waters, in comparison with the leading countries and also within South America (Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay), and among ecoregions. The patterns observed suggest that Chile has advanced, but concentrated, conservation efforts in low-threat, remote ecoregions. There is an urgent need to progress towards high-threat ecoregions, which implies balancing the needs of nature and people. The distribution of ancillary conservation instruments can help double the level of protection in threatened coastal areas, filling gaps in marine conservation and creating an opportunity to progress and diversify conservation strategies.",0,,10.1002/aqc.3570,WOS:000631017400001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no social mechanism,

This low level of ocean protection is due largely to conflicts with fisheries and other extractive uses. To address this issue, here we developed a conservation planning framework to prioritize highly protected MPAs in places that would result in multiple benefits today and in the future. We find that a substantial increase in ocean protection could have triple benefits, by protecting biodiversity, boosting the yield of fisheries and securing marine carbon stocks that are at risk from human activities. Our results show that most coastal nations contain priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage. A globally coordinated effort could be nearly twice as efficient as uncoordinated, national-level conservation planning.

Coupled with other anthropogenic stressors, climate change has contributed to declines in freshwater biodiversity of greater severity than those observed across marine or terrestrial taxa. At a macro level, inland fisheries are experiencing declines. There are, however, a number of success stories, or 'bright spots,' in inland recreational fisheries management, where innovative approaches are leading to increases in social and ecological well-being in the face of climate change. Cases such as these are important sources of inspiration and learning about adaptation to climate and environmental change. In this article, we analyze 11 examples of such 'bright spots' drawn from multiple jurisdictions around the world from which we extracted lessons that might apply to fisheries management challenges beyond the region and context of each case. Collectively, these bright spots highlight adaptive initiatives that allow for recreational fisheries management to mitigate to stressors associated with current and future climate change. Examples identified include community-based restoration projects, collaborative and adaptive approaches to short-term fisheries closures, transdisciplinary large-scale conservation projects, and conservation-minded efforts by individuals and communities. By highlighting examples of 'small wins' within inland recreational fisheries management, this review contributes to the idea that a 'positive future' for inland recreational fisheries in the face of climate change is possible and highlights potential strategies to adapt to current and future climate scenarios.",0,2021,10.1007/s11160-021-09638-y,WOS:000627684200002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,freshwater ,

Specifically, we analyzed the spatiotemporal fishing effort within the West African region, mapped fishing effort in the direct vicinity of the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (PNBA, Mauritania) and the Bijagos Archipelago (BA, Guinea Bissau), and compared the seasonal overlap between elasmobranch bycatch and fishing effort near these MPAs. We combined Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and local fisheries observer data, and determined fishing effort for each gear type and compared this with bycatch of elasmobranchs. We found that industrial fishing effort was dominated by trawling, drifting longlines, and fixed gear types. Although no industrial fishing was observed within both MPAs, 72 and 78% of the buffer zones surrounding the MPAs were fished for the Banc d'Arguin and Bijagos, respectively. Within the Banc d'Arguin buffer zone, trawling and drifting longlines dominated, with longlines mainly being deployed in fall. In the Bijagos buffer zone, trawling and fixed gears were most prevalent. Fisheries observer data for Mauritania showed that elasmobranch catches increased during the most recent sampling years (2016-2018). Elasmobranch catches within the waters of Guinea Bissau peaked in 2016 and decreased in the following two years. Seasonal patterns in elasmobranch bycatch within the waters of both countries are likely caused by increased catches of migratory species. Catches of rays peaked in May and June for Mauritania, and in October for Guinea Bissau. Shark catches were highest in February and July in Mauritanian waters, and in May and October in the waters of Guinea Bissau. Our study indicates that industrial fisheries near the border of ecologically important MPAs may have potentially major implications for ecosystem functioning by the removal of (migratory) predatory species.",0,2021,10.3389/fmars.2021.602917,WOS:000630003600001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,impacts of fishing on MPAs,

Understanding and addressing non-compliance is critical given continued efforts to establish MPAs to meet international milestones (e.g., Aichi targets). We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to address five key questions and research gaps for MPAs: 1) how is non-compliance best measured? 2) what are common drivers of noncompliance? 3) what is the overall prevalence of non-compliance? 4) how frequently is ecological failure of MPAs attributed to non-compliance? and 5) are there measurable management impacts on regulated fishing in MPAs (i.e., effective reduction of fishing)? We found 151 papers that had some focus on non-compliant resource extraction in MPAs and 96 that quantified it. Insufficient enforcement was the most cited driver of noncompliance, followed by several socio-economic drivers including lack of awareness, livelihood/economic gain, social norms, and ineffective governance. Prohibited fishing in MPAs was often reduced compared to outside areas, as shown by our meta-analysis. However, we found frequent reports and measures of noncompliance globally, and many cases of failed ecological performance attributed primarily to non-compliance (57% of 67 relevant studies). Overall, our synthesis demonstrates that non-compliance continues to be a prevalent issue for MPAs. Reducing non-compliance and ensuring effective MPAs will rely on continuous evaluation of non-compliance to inform adaptive management, as well as addressing the complex, interrelated drivers that arise throughout MPA planning, establishment, and management.",0,2021,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108992,WOS:000632912000008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,drivers of non compliance,

The success of MPAs, and therefore the delivery of their potential outcomes for human well-being and global sustainability, requires multi-disciplinary, holistic, and comprehensive approaches for its achievement. In this study, the global scientific literature on MPAs was quantitatively reviewed through bibliometrics approaches, investigating patterns and trends in its development over time. In particular, bibliometric network and citation burst analyses of keywords were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The bibliographic search on the Scopus and Web of Science databases resulted in a total number of 5908 and 6036 scientific documents published on MPAs. The network analysis of the keywords co-occurrence produced four main clusters whose connections and overlapping showed a multidisciplinary structure of MPA science, in which the ecological, social, and economic domains of research are strongly interlinked. Temporal analyses showed a recent focus on topics related to the social-ecological systems theory (e.g., ecosystem services, marine spatial planning, governance, and small-scale fisheries) suggesting that newer research lines recognize the importance of integrating the ?human dimension? in conservation and sustainability studies. Overall, the results of both the performed bibliometric analyses pointed out the evolution of MPA science from the conventional concept of ?marine reserves? to a broader scope integrating ecological, economic, and social aspects. In conclusion, MPA research is timely responding to the identification of MPAs as ocean sustainability tools, opening MPA science to multi-disciplinary research lines by linking the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of sustainability.

The well-established Recreation Experience Preference scale provides a useful framework for understanding motivations but very few studies have applied the REP scale to coastal and marine protected areas (CMPA). Applying the REP scale in a coastal and marine context is of interest considering the different characteristics, constraints and management compared to terrestrial protected areas. This paper explores the motivational aspects of 1000 recreational users of French CMPAs. Past research indicates French CMPAs are characterized by a low public visibility and few perceived benefits as a place to recreate. An onsite, face to face questionnaire gathered recreational user motivation data subsequently analyzed using the REP scale domains. REP domains were characterized by four main domains: Enjoy nature, Escape personalsocialpressures, Achievement/stimulation and Physical fitness. A standardized clustering procedure was used to identify groups of respondents with similar patterns of REP response. It suggested partitioning the motivations into four segments: Solitaries, Antistress performers,Socialisers and Explorers.

Since the MPA designation, there has been an increase in vessels using static gear inside and outside the MPA, with a significant positive trend for vessels using static gear inside the MPA. Over time, static gear landings have decreased by 110 kg per vessel per month, although there has been a significant positive trend over time in value (landings of 1,452 pound per vessel per month), linked to catches of high value species such as lobster, which are associated with the reef ecosystem. Fishing activity providing high volume (weight) and value landings from vessels using mobile demersal gears within the MPA ceased in July 2008. Mobile demersal gear fishing effort has since increased significantly outside the MPA. The value of mobile demersal gear landings in 2017 are comparable to fishing activity prior to the MPA designation, but has not reached the peak landings values of 2008 when the MPA was designated. Fishers predominantly using mobile demersal gear report lower subjective wellbeing and material losses. Static gear fishers report higher levels of subjective wellbeing over time compared to their mobile demersal gear counterparts.

However, these arrangements can link village-based and centralized governance systems in many ways, resulting in new hybridized institutional organizations, operational scales, and governance process. Examining the context-specific social, cultural, and historical processes that shape these programs can reveal how systems for comanagement develop, and how institutional differences influence adaptive capacity. Using analytical tools drawn from critical institutionalism and broad institutional perspectives, we assess how different institutional histories and processes of hybridization informed the adaptive capacity of two comanagement programs in Samoa: the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP) and the Marine Protected Area (MPA) program. While the programs were embedded in similar cultural and ecological contexts, the MPA program became inactive following the 2009 Pacific tsunami, while the CBFMP endured. In spite of early efforts to involve communities in the MPA program's development, the institutional history and organization of the program's managing agency informed an interpretation of comanagement principles that did not adequately incorporate traditional Samoan institutions for coastal management, reducing its adaptive capacity. In contrast, the CBFMP gained resilience through its fundamental integration with village-based social and political institutions, social norms, and values. This analysis of institutional histories, structures, and program outcomes demonstrates that colonial legacies pose obstacles for successful hybridized governance in the Pacific, while also confirming the valuable contributions integrated traditional institutions can make to improving adaptive capacity.",0,2021,10.1007/s10113-020-01730-6,WOS:000606418200001,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PDF not found

This sea urchin species has a determinant ecological role in structuring infralittoral benthic assemblages and is the most exploited echinoid in Europe.

Declared catches and semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders were used to define the socio-economical context, underline existing conflicts among them, as well as to trace the historical evolution of sea urchin fishery. The results show that the management of sea urchin fishery is not sustainable, primarily because of the stakeholders' non-compliance with the rules. P. lividus stock is progressively declining (-73% in 9 years), showing no difference between MPA (0.5 +/- 0.15 ind./m(2)) and control sites (0.3 +/- 0.04 ind./m(2)).

In the proposed Taza marine protected area (MPA) (Algeria, SW Mediterranean), recreational boat fishing is poorly regulated and its catches remain unmonitored. In addition, a significant number of REC fishers sell their catch illegally, an activity we could refer to as IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing. This study is a good opportunity to evaluate the potential conflicts between recreational IUU and commercial fisheries and can be extremely valuable in terms of MPA planning and fisheries monitoring by providing baseline data for setting up sound fisheries management and conservation plans. Two fishing harbors are located near the proposed Taza MPA: Boudis and Ziama. Illegal REC boats from Ziama harbor were studied via a direct observation method of landings developed by the Ifremer (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea). A comparison between illegal REC and SSF boats was highlighted in terms of catches and fishing effort. A total of 54 taxa belonging to 24 families were observed in the catches of the 32 recreational active boats in this harbor between May 2013 and April 2014.

Illegal REC in the proposed Taza MPA is an important socioeconomic activity which is intensively practiced throughout the year. From November to April, the mean catch was almost the same for both fishing categories. Strong competition between recreational and professional fishers for the natural resources was highlighted as 81% of the 54 caught taxa were present in the catches of both fishing categories (i.e. 44 taxa).

National parks are afforded varying degrees of protection with recreational fishing allowed in some form within the boundaries of some parks. However, little is known about the extent to which recreational fishing occurs in national parks or the types of regulations that govern the activity. Vast differences in data availability exist throughout the world (partly related to language barriers and institutional capacity), limiting our understanding of the various uses of national parks. Acknowledging these limitations, we sought to consider the extent of recreational fisheries activities and their management within national parks around the globe. Using the World Database on Protected Areas, we selected the countries that had International Union for the Conservation of Nature type II areas. Within those countries, we investigated national parks that permitted recreational fishing in freshwater and/or marine systems and cataloged information on fisheries regulations, such as size limits and catch quotas. Overall, an equal number of 195 countries allowed some form of recreational fishing within their national parks as the number of countries which did not report any data on recreational fishing at all. Meanwhile, recreational fishing was forbidden in only a few countries with IUCN II national parks. For countries with information available, we found high adoption of recreational fisheries regulations, with the majority of countries requiring specialized park fishing licenses and that all fish be released (i.e., exclusively catch-and-release), though for many countries this information was not reported. The lack of information retrieved on recreational fishing in national parks may reflect search bias or lack of such regulations.

Based on these experiences, and an ensuing increase in the Spawning Potential Ratio of the bonefish stock, it is proposed that nationally recognized local management systems that incorporate fisheries research, youth education, and the cultural practices of communities should be supported in the marine policies of the Pacific Islands and beyond.",0,2021,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104291,WOS:000600320900013,field,perception,2020,LMMA,Anaa Atoll,1,young,2019,PPA,,NA,NA,NA,yes,community-based,French Polynesia,tropical,Oceania,South Pacific,coral reef,,,fish,bonefish,fished,,,,coastal community,information,local,education,positive,no,school environmental program,paragraph 2.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis based on the ProtectedSeas database, which includes information on regulated activities, found that 85% of U.S. waters are in managed areas that restrict living resource extraction at some level above generally applicable regulations, with 52% managed at a low level of protection and 3% managed as highly protected no-take areas. States with the most state waters area in no-take MPAs are Hawaii (similar to 25%), California (similar to 9%), and Oregon (similar to 3%). The majority of highly protected areas in U.S. waters exist in low-populated areas of the Pacific, such as the Papahanaumokuakea and Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments. Under a quarter of U.S. waters are closed to bottom trawling, with the West Coast and Alaska each contributing one-third of trawl closures by area. Bottom trawling is prohibited in nearly 90% of West Coast waters. Focusing on waters off California showed that overlapping management and fishing gear restrictions can increase overall protection. In state waters, no-take MPAs account for roughly 9% of the area, while restricted take MPAs of different types cover 27% of the area. About 40% of California state waters are in some kind of MPA, while 13.4% of state waters have a high level of protection from fishing impacts. In federal waters off California, under one percent are in no-take areas while nearly all waters are subject to some kind of fishery restriction.

This study focused on the perspectives of fishers in evaluating the effectiveness of an MPA to address their management propositions. The study analysed the drafting and implementation of a multiple-use MPA management plan in the southern coast of Brazil. It evaluated the outcomes in fulfilling the small-scale fishers' proposals, raised and collectively agreed to in a participatory drafting process. Four years after the release of the MPA management plan half of the fishers' proposals were fulfilled. Most of the fishers' fulfilled proposals were related to regulations within the MPA and to strategies to improve their political representativeness, while the majority of the proposals on fishing licensing and on public policies to foster the activity have not yet been achieved. Scale mismatches, authority limitations, and options for innovative institutional arrangements are discussed here as key elements of the results.

The three dimen-sional model describes the time evolution of the resource, the fishing effort and the price. The model is original because it considers a nonlinear harvesting function assumed to depend upon stock size and fishing effort with a saturation effect with respect to the resource as well as a price equation depending on demand and supply which is in addition proportional to price. Assuming that the price varies at a fast time scale, we are able to use ?ag-gregation of variables methods? in order to reduce the model in a two dimensional model at a slow time scale. This aggregated (reduced) model is analyzed. Several numerical simulations of the model are performed to substantiate our analytical findings. The existence of nonlinear harvesting makes the dynamics of the model more complicated, including multiple equilibria, bi-stability and limit cycle. Such large amplitude cycle varia-tions are not desirable because they generate periods of overfishing at periods of very low activity. We then study the effects of marine reserves on the dynamics of the fishery, showing that for an adequate number of small reserves, limit cycle oscillations are switched off.",0,2021,10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100906,WOS:000632600400006,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,global,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

This paper focuses on the seascape and landscape characteristics that are most associated with the existence of dive sites, aiming to identify other suitable locations along the coast to potentially reduce environmental pressure (e.g., overcrowding and physical damage) on the existing dive sites. Logistic regressions were employed to model the suitability for dive sites existence in the Portuguese south coast (Algarve), one of the most popular Summer destinations in mainland Europe. Results suggest that closeness to waterlines and piers and the presence of rock structures in the coastal strip are the most important attributes that positively influence dive sites' existence, whereas the beach environment and the presence of muddy sediments are negatively associated with it. In this study, we suggest the application of a logistic model to find alternatives for the explored dive sites as a quick and easily applied coastal management tool.

Spatial-temporal restrictions of fishing activities are important measures used for the management of marine stocks. However, sometimes these regulations are not fully implemented due to a lack of effectiveness and compliance, which contributes to their failure. Here, we developed a food-web model approach using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model representing the Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA) of the Gulf of Lion ecosystem (CoSEGoL model) prior to the establishment of the fisheries restrictions (2006-2008). We characterized the structure and functioning of the ecosystem before and after its establishment. The constructed food-web model was then fitted to the available time series of data from 2008 to 2016 to verify whether this FRA has contributed to the recovery of target demersal species and the demersal community. The fitted model was used to explore alternative future management scenarios to explore feasible management options in order to ensure a full ecosystem recovery under climate change conditions. Our results suggest a failure in the recovery of target species in the restricted area under the current management scenario, potentially revealing a lack of protection efficiency and/or enforcement. Scenarios of management options under plausible climate futures revealed possible recovery of targeted species, especially European hake.

Local fishery benefits from spillover will likely generate support from fishing communities for marine reserves. We used underwater visual census to show that biomass of Acanthuridae (surgeonfish) and Carangidae (jacks), two families of reef fish that account for 40-75% of the fishery yield from Apo Island, Philippines, tripled in a well-protected no-take reserve over 18 years (1983-2001).

Along the coast of British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the 1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge. Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3) promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4) developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government, including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts, indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to marine resources and territorial management rights.",2,2020,10.5751/ES-12027-250433,WOS:000603995100036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not impacts of preserved areas,

In this paper we quantitatively identify the economic and social differences between communities based on whether or not the community has a tabu area in their local fishing ground. This is an area permanently closed to fishing within a locally managed marine area (LMMA), a form of MPA in the Pacific region. To do this we analyse survey data at both the household and village level in Kadavu, an administrative province of Fiji. We find there are differences in economic activity and diet between the communities but little difference in overall income and wealth. Our study shows that villages with an active tabu area have more positive social outcomes in terms of perceptions of LMMAs. However, there are some notable negative social outcomes as well. In particular, we find that households not engaged in commercial fishing perceive conflict around the management of marine resources. We also find that households engaged in commercial fishing believe penalties for violating LMMA rules are high. Together, these results could potentially impede the adoption of LMMAs and tabu areas.

We assessed the risk of adverse effects from abrasion caused by bottom fishing, as a case study, to demonstrate an integrated spatial management methodology. Risk was quantified in the Galway Bay, Ireland region using a 1 km grid, as the ratio between mortality and recovery of benthic infauna exposed to abrasion effects estimated from fishing data. Risk was considered high if annual mortality exceeded recovery. A Bayesian network model, incorporating ecological and economic data, compared three management scenarios: i) business as usual (BAU), ii) exclusion of fishing vessels over 18 m within 6 nautical miles (68% of study area) (Length) and iii) a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) closed to all fishing vessels (11% of study area) (MPA).

This study compares the monthly landed catch distribution for commercial marine species averaged for 12 years (2006-2017) from Istanbul fish market, to catch rates of those species during the spawning seasons. Our results revealed that at first glance, most commercially important fish species examined here have their spawning seasons protected under the Turkish industrial seasonal closure period, especially for small and medium pelagics, as well as some demersals. On the other hand, taxa with winter spawning seasons such as Merlangius merlangus, John dory Zeus faber, brown meagre Sciaena umbra, big-scale sand smelt Atherina boyeri, and bogue Boops boops do not benefit from the commercial fisheries summer closure (>50% of their catch total). Also, some species are still heavily fished (>35% of their catch total) during the closure implying they are mainly targeted by small-scale fisheries (SSF).

As the global population increases, new and expanding pressures are created on fish resources. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been widely promoted as valuable tools for rebuilding or maintaining fish stocks around the world. The success of MPAs, however, widely depends on their particular configuration and management and their effectiveness is often object of contentious debates in both scientific and political arenas. Since fisheries management is a collective action problem, some forms of human cooperation in terms of fishing behaviour can lead to sustainable fisheries and can represent, in theory, a complementary or even an alternative approach to the establishment of no-take marine reserves. We present here a new Agent-Based Model (ABM) that captures the main characteristics of an idealised small-scale fishery. We then use the model to investigate the combined effects of different fishing strategies (expressed by a cooperative trait associated to fishing effort) and various configurations of no-take reserves (including presence or absence of MPA, size of MPA, age of MPA, i.e. time elapsed since its establisment, and distance between two MPAs) on fish abundance and catch under an overfishing regime. Our results show that high cooperation without an MPA can be as effective as lower levels of cooperation combined with an MPA in maintaining fish stocks and catches at relatively high levels. The mobility of our fish agents implies that, contrary to current belief, these results may not be limited to sedentary species. We also found that the greatest impacts on fish abundance and catch are produced by the size of an MPA and the time elapsed since its establishment. Furthermore, the distance between two MPAs has no significant effect, regardless of the cooperation levels characterising the fishing agents. Despite its simplicity, the ABM presented here provides insights on the most plausible effects that combinations of different MPA designs and human cooperation strategies can produce on overexploited small-scale fisheries. When appropriately adapted with a realistic, fishery-specific parameterisation, this model can constitute a valuable tool for evaluating the impact of different resource management strategies.

Since MPAs can benefit both conservation and fisheries in areas experiencing overfishing and since overfishing is common in many coastal nations, we ask how MPAs can be designed specifically to improve fisheries yields. We assembled distribution, life history, and fisheries exploitation data for 1,338 commercially important stocks to derive an optimized network of MPAs globally. We show that strategically expanding the existing global MPA network to protect an additional 5% of the ocean could increase future catch by at least 20% via spillover, generat-ing 9 to 12 million metric tons more food annually than in a business-as-usual world with no additional protection.

Two sites were protected from fishing for over 20 years, whereas the other five sites were heavily fished in recent years. A heavily fished site was converted into a marine park (Mombasa Marine National Park, approximately 10km(2), no fishing allowed), and the number of fishers allowed was slowly decreased between August 1991 and August 1992. The area adjacent to the park was converted into a marine reserve (only fishing traps, lines, and gill nets allowed) that provided fishing grounds for fishers excluded from the park. Data from a fish-landing site adjacent to the newly created marine park were collected for 3 years and analyzed to determine the effect of the park's creation on fish catches. Results suggest that fishing in the reserve reduced fish wet weight by about a factor of 10 and reduced fish numbers and species richness by a factor of two. Both field studies and landing site's fishing grounds were protected with the creation of the park, and 65% of the fishers quit the studied landing, leaving nearly the same density of fishers in the remaining area (similar to 12 fishers/km(2)). Further, fishers using pull seines were excluded from the reserve, and their numbers were replaced by fishers using other gear (mostly basket traps). Although the overall catch per unit effort increased by about 110% after the park's creation, the total fish landed decreased by 35% and the catch per unit effort decreased toward the end of the study period despite increasing fish abundance in the park. Although establishment of small parks elsewhere have increased the total catch, the large park we studied did not; one reason may nave been the lower ratio of edge to park area of the large park. Alternatively, the park's edge may have provided a good fishing area, so fishing effort may have been highest along the park's edge. Consequently, a barrier may have been created that restricted fish dispersal to most of the reserve. Therefore, the area that had an increased catch was small (<1 to 2km from the edge) and could not compensate for the lose fishing area. Most fish species within the park showed recovery after fisher exclusion. Total fish wet weights 3 years after the fisher's exclusion were 25% below the older marine parks. Poor recovery of the herbivorous parrot and surgeonfish can account for much of this shortfall. Competition for resources with sea urchins appear to be slowing recovery of these two groups.

Thus, monitoring fisheries catches before, during and after MPA implementation is essential to document changes in fisheries activities and to evaluate the impact of MPAs in fishers' communities. Remarkably, in contrast with standard fisheries-independent biological surveys, these data are rarely measured at appropriate spatial scales following MPA implementation. Here, the effects of MPA implementation on local fisheries are assessed in a temperate MPA (Arrabida Marine Park, Portugal), using fisheries monitoring methods combining spatial distribution of fishing effort, on-board observations and official landings statistics at scales appropriate to the Marine Park. Fisheries spatial distribution, fishing effort, on-board data collection and official landings registered for the same vessels over time were analysed between 2004 and 2010. The applicability and reliability of using landings statistics alone was tested (i.e. when no sampling data are available) and we conclude that landings data alone only allow the identification of general patterns. The combination of landings information (which is known to be unreliable in many coastal communities) with other methods, provides an effective tool to evaluate fisheries dynamics in response to MPA implementation. As resources for monitoring socio-ecological responses to MPAs are frequently scarce, the use of landings data calibrated with fisheries information (from vessels, gear distribution and on-board data) is a valuable tool applicable to many worldwide coastal small-scale fisheries.

MPAs have the potential to benefit both ecosystems and human communities if well-designed and implemented. Achieving effective implementation and governance of MPAs, however, is complicated because they deal with systems that overlap with both non-human environments and human economies and societies. As a result, MPA success is thought to be primarily dependent on socioeconomic factors, particularly the behavior of stakeholder groups involved in the MPAs. Using the theory of relational coordination, we designed surveys that we delivered to members of four stakeholder groups implicated in five MPAs in the Spanish Mediterranean to investigate their habits of interand intra-group communication and relations. Relational coordination posits that high-quality communication and relations results in positive stakeholder behaviors and an effective system, which makes it a useful tool to investigate the effectiveness of the MPAs involved in this study. Our results demonstrate that a high degree of relational coordination leads to higher satisfaction on the part of the participants in the system. The exploratory model constructed here also supports the notion that each stakeholder group adopts particular beliefs and behaves in particular ways in terms of relational coordination and satisfaction. We found patterns that indicated poor communication and relations amongst the four stakeholder groups, which in turn has grave implications for management outcomes of these MPAs. Cumulatively, these conditions could precipitate management failure. To remedy these concerns, we recommend establishing channels of communication between the four stakeholder groups, and investigating means to cultivate good relations amongst these groups. Doing so will help assure management success.",1,2020,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111003,WOS:000574828300004,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,satisfaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support and satisfaction

The overarching objectives of SFM are to maximize both conservation and socio-economic benefits, while minimizing short-term socio-economic costs. A number of tools have been developed to achieve SFM objectives, ranging from fishery specific to ecosystem-based strategies. Closures are a common SFM tool used to balance the trade-off between socio-economic and conservation considerations; they vary in scope from small-scale temporary closures to large-scale permanent networks. Unfortunately, closures are frequently implemented without a plan for monitoring or assessing whether SFM objectives are met. In situations in which a monitoring plan is not in place we propose that commonly available fishery data can often be used to evaluate whether management tools are effective in meeting SFM objectives. Here, we present a case study of closures on Georges Bank that shows how fishery data can be analyzed to perform such an assessment. Since 2006, on the Canadian side of Georges Bank, seasonal scallop fishery closures have been implemented with the aim of reducing by-catch of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea) during spawning. In lieu of data from a dedicated monitoring program, we analyzed data from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), fishery logbooks, and a scallop survey to assess the impact of these closures on the scallop fishery, and use observer data (i.e. by-catch) to assess the effectiveness of these closures in meeting their conservation objective. While compliance for these time-area closures was high, the closures did not significantly displace fishing activity and overall there was limited evidence of an impact on the scallop fishery. Further, the discard rates for both cod and yellowtail were above average when their respective closures were active. These results suggest that improvements to the closures design and/or other measures may be required to achieve the desired SFM objectives.",4,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0240322,WOS:000581813300021,field,BA,2018,fishery closure,Georges Bank,12,,2006,PPA,,0,300,,NA,NA,USA,temperate,North America,North West Atlantic,mix,,,invertebrate,scallops,fished,no,,,fishery,agency,,access rights,positive,no,"""time-area closures had minimal impact on the scallop fishery""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery closure

Key areas of debate include uncertainty over nations' abilities to enforce fishing bans across vast, remote regions and the intensity of human impacts before and after MPA implementation. We used a recently developed vessel tracking data set (produced using Automatic Identification System detections) to quantify the response of industrial fishing fleets to 5 of the largest MPAs established in the Pacific Ocean since 2013. After their implementation, all 5 MPAs successfully kept industrial fishing effort exceptionally low. Detected fishing effort was already low in 4 of the 5 large MPAs prior to MPA implementation, particularly relative to nearby regions that did not receive formal protection. Our results suggest that these large MPAs may present major conservation opportunities in relatively intact ecosystems with low immediate impact to industrial fisheries, but the large MPAs we considered often did not significantly reduce fishing effort because baseline fishing was typically low. It is yet to be determined how large MPAs may shape global ocean conservation in the future if the footprint of human influence continues to expand.

In this research, we sought to understand the perceptions of artisanal fishers living around the Arvoredo Biological Reserve, a no-take MPA located in southern Brazil, and their relationship with the MPA. The fishing communities in this study are located in Tijucas Bay, an estuary located within the buffer zone of this MPA but outside its boundaries. Data collection was conducted using interviews and participatory mapping with artisanal fishers. The results show that fishers have detailed knowledge about different species, the bay, and the connections between the bay and the MPA. The fishers noted that the proper functioning of the MPA relies on avoiding industrial fishing in its borders and to limit trawling within the bay. Such measures are already in the MPA management plan, but lack of compliance is a perceived constraint. Data also show that local ecological knowledge is important to support the monitoring and evaluation of MPAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In communities with arapaima co-management, median female fishing revenue was US$ 215/yr and mean probability of women earning income from fisheries was 77%, a marked difference from the virtually non-existent female fishing income at communities without arapaima co-management (median = US$ 0; mean probability = 8%). Although many women often participate in commercial fisheries, arapaima co-management has been the only source of fishing income for most of them.

However, the capacity of the nation's domestic fishery to exploit pelagic species must be built to meet these objectives and, to this aim, the development of a coastal network of Fish Attracting Devices (FADs) has been proposed. To inform the development of the nation's FAD program, we used acoustic telemetry to study the movements of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within Palau's existing FAD network. Subadult yellowfin tuna (50 - 79 cm FL) remained within the FAD network for up to 175 days and young-of-the-year yellowfin tuna spent significantly more time in association with FADs in comparison to year-1 fish. A network analysis suggests that the Ngardmau and Peleliu FADs were the most important components of the current FAD network, and a mixed effects Poisson generalized linear model indicated that the residency of yellowfin tuna to these FADs was significantly related to mooring depth and distance from the reef.

No-take areas generally had positive impacts on the species richness, biomass, density, and size of target reef fish, while exclusive access areas were similar to predicted counterfactual conditions. The latter is likely because overall fishing pressure in exclusive access areas might not actually change, although more fish could be exploited by communities with access rights.

To address this concern we conduct an economic analysis of rebuilding six depleted Canadian fish stocks under different biological and management scenarios. Rebuilding scenario projections are based on underlying fish stock assessments and fish species' life history traits, and thus are also influenced by uncertainties in these parameters. We find that rebuilding generates economic gains for five of the six fish stocks in the long term, with estimated economic gains under the most and least optimistic scenarios reaching up to 11 times and 5 times above the status quo, respectively. In most cases, fishery closure generates higher potential economic gains compared to a low-fishing strategy, regardless of the rate of fish stock recovery. Intergenerational discounting increases estimated economic benefits, thereby emphasizing the importance of taking a long-term perspective to fisheries rebuilding. Our results suggest that bearing the short-term economic costs of rebuilding can lead to future economic benefits, which in the long term are an improvement over maintaining the status quo.",0,2020,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105289,WOS:000571870500006,model,,,ABMT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,incomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Based on previously established descriptors, including the coexistence of MPAs and SSFs, we conduct a literature review of 92 peer-reviewed papers. Thirty-five components of HD are categorized into five categories: governance, economic, cultural, political and social. Despite multiple interpretations, the notion of HD has a specific meaning that involves attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and preferences and indicates different human uses and compliance (or lack of compliance) with conservation rules. We find that the number of papers published per year has generally been increasing, and most papers are found in journals related to natural sciences. The low incidence of these studies in human and social science journals may generate an imbalance since themes such as gender or poverty, are scarce. Overly narrow conceptions can create blind spots that reinforce command and control approaches despite the emergence of holistic approaches.

Marine reserves, which represent a management tradeoff between harvesting and conservation, are fundamental to maintenance of fisheries. Finding optimal reserve sizes that improve fishing yields is not only of theoretical interest, but also of practical importance to facilitate decision making. Also, since the migratory behavior of some species influences the spillover effect of a marine reserve, this is a key consideration when assessing performance of marine reserves. The relationship between optimal reserve size and migration rate/mode has not been well studied, but it is fundamental to management success. Here, I investigate optimal reserve size and its management outcome with different levels of spillover via a simple two-patch mathematical model. In this model, one patch is open to fishing, and the other is closed. The two-patch model is aggregated by single-population dynamics when the migration rate is sufficiently larger than the growth rate of a target species. At this limit, I show that an optimal reserve size exists when pre-reserve fishing occurs at fishing mortality larger than f (MSY), the fishing mortality at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Also, the fishing yield at an optimal reserve size becomes as large as MSY at the limit. Numerical simulations at various migration rates between the two patches suggest that the maximum harvest under management with a marine reserve is achieved at this limit. This contrasts with the conservation benefit which is maximized at an intermediate migration rate. Numerical simulations show that the above-mentioned condition for an optimal reserve size to exist derived from the aggregated model is necessary when the migration rate is not sufficiently large, and that a moderate migration rate is further necessary for an optimal reserve size to exist. However, high fishing mortality reduces this requirement.",0,2020,10.7717/peerj.9798,WOS:000562320100007,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,global,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

We draw on our analysis to distill lessons for our case studies and LSMPAs globally. We emphasize that policy interactions are dynamic and malleable: they should be proactively managed to stimulate synergy and address conflict. Understanding and managing policy interactions is complex and context-specific, requiring dedicated resources, cross-sectoral coordination, and sophisticated scientific and practical policy expertise. To avoid undesirable consequences and capitalize on opportunities to secure multiple benefits, we recommend that policy actors systematically evaluate, monitor, and adapt to policy interactions throughout LSMPA design and implementation.",1,2021,10.1111/conl.12753,WOS:000561429700001,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,policy interactions

For each MPA, a food-web model accounting for each protection level (PL) was developed: the fully protected area (FPA), the partially protected area (PPA) and the unprotected area (UPA) surrounding the MPA. Using the resulting nine food-web models, the ecosystem structure and functioning of each PL were compared and characterized, differences and similarities within and among the three MPAs were assessed, and ecosystem response to full protection was evaluated for the three MPAs. Differences in terms of ecosystem structure and functioning were found among PLs. Overall, FPAs presented the most positive effect of protection in terms of ecosystem structure and functioning, followed by PPAs. However, the effects of protection on neighbouring UPAs were hardly noticeable. Similarities between Cerbere-Banyuls and Medes Islands MPAs were observed, while Cap de Creus MPA showed the least benefits from protection overall. These results are likely to be due to similarities in the configuration of the protected areas, the levels of enforcement and compliance, and the impact of recreational and small-scale fisheries allowed in the PPAs and UPAs.

The Southern Ocean offers a case study in understanding such tradeoffs, where MPAs are actively being discussed to achieve a range of protection and sustainable use objectives. Here, we evaluated the possible impacts of two MPA scenarios on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators, especially when closed areas included at least 50-75% of their foraging distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial management of the krill fishery outside the MPA.

Over the past few decades, the implementation of MPAs has achieved mixed results with regard to conservation goals, which has driven the scientific community to contemplate what factors may determine the effectiveness of an MPA. Most previous analyses have tended to focus on the design criteria of MPAs as well as post-closure management capabilities, but pre-closure conditions are seldom considered. Here, we investigate the effects of varying pre-closure fishing effort scenarios on MPA performance by applying a developed evaluation framework and age-structured dynamic model for the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China. We specifically focus on the overall fishing pressure imposed on the fish population and the spatial heterogeneity of fishing effort. We used ecological and social indicators to evaluate the effects of MPAs. Our results demonstrate that MPAs with lower pre-closure fishing pressure are more effective than thosewith higher pre-closure fishing pressure in recovering the fish population. Highly aggregated fishing efforts inside the MPAs prior to their implementations could also make MPAs less effective. By comparing our findings to other studies, we noticed that evaluation metrics and time frames could make a difference in determining the effects of a given MPA, which indicates the importance of monitoring programs. From a social perspective, placing MPAs in heavily exploited areas without additional harvest regulations may result in a tragedy of the commons situation that leads to a significant loss in catches. This study highlights the ecological and social risks of establishing MPAs under different pre-closure fishing scenarios and provides insights for the development of marine conservation plans.

These pressures have caused widespread declines in reef health, resulting in the increased use of spatial management tools such as marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs have proven generally effective if well designed and enforced, but there are limited long-term studies investigating how the presence of small-scale MPAs affects fish populations and reef communities. Using a 12-year time series, we found that small-scale (10-50 ha) community-managed MPAs along the Danajon Bank of the Philippines preserved average fish biomass within their boundaries over time relative to surrounding fished reefs. Unprotected areas are, however, showing significant long-term biomass decline. MPAs were also found to preserve more key trophic groups and larger-bodied commercially targeted reef fish families. Fish biomass of piscivore, scavenger and invertivore trophic groups inside individual MPAs is, however, still declining at a similar rate as outside. Surprisingly, long-term benthic cover and growth form composition were not significantly affected overall by MPA presence, despite the sporadic use of highly destructive dynamite fishing in this region. Coral cover has remained historically low (21-28%) throughout the study, following widespread bleaching mortality. While management tempered overall abundance declines, we found that irrespective of MPA presence, there was a generalised decline of both large- and small-bodied fish size groups across the study region, most steeply within the 20-30 cm length fish, and a shift towards proportionally higher abundances of small (5-10 cm) fish. This indicates a combination of over-exploitation, inadequate MPA size and coverage for larger fish, and the lingering effects of the 1998 bleaching event. Generalised shifts in body size and trophic structure reported here could lead to future reductions in fishery productivity and stability and will be further exacerbated unless broader fishery regulations and enforcement is instated.",0,2020,10.1007/s00338-020-01987-7,WOS:000554334900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

We define success in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social and economic aspects. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, observational data and literature review of case studies across the African continent, we highlight two critical findings. First, large scale BE initiatives prioritize economic gains at the expense of environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities. Second, using the full spectrum sustainability (FSS) evaluation, we show that successful BE interventions considered ecological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional objectives. Drawing on these case studies, we propose the adoption of a collaborative framework which amalgamates the top-down and bottom-up approaches to BE management.

Qualitative data was first collected through interviews with key informants and in participatory stakeholder workshops exploring the key threats, trade-offs, and challenges for promoting sustainable futures in the marine environment. Secondly, focus groups with local fishers explored the impacts of marine policy upon access to natural resources and local livelihoods, and detailed the role of local ecological knowledge for supporting marine conservation practice. An analysis of grey literature provided additional, contextual data. The case study demonstrates that local ecological knowledge has an important role in informing fine grained, spatial, and temporal management approaches for marine spatial planning. However, in the absence of trust between state planners and fishing communities', knowledge sharing can be challenging. These factors are exacerbated by restrictions that marine policies place on local livelihoods, and the dominance of western paradigms for conservation that marginalises alternative knowledge contributions.

This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of two real case temporary NTZs closed during a 5-6 year period in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea, using scenario analysis to account for uncertainty in both the biological and economic effects. A sensitivity analysis was added for certain key parameters. The results of the cost-benefit analyses for the two NTZs are positive in all scenarios relating to the most realistic case of no opportunity costs, i.e., assuming that all fishing activity could be relocated to adjacent areas without cost during the closed period. As an extreme case comparison, full opportunity costs were included, assuming that no fishing activity could be relocated to other areas during the closed period.

The data and information derived from the surveys are used to provide a reference situation and to develop a complete inventory of threats faced by MPAs in the region. MPA managers identified unmanaged fisheries, coastal erosion, overexploitation of natural resources and pollution as the main threats to the sustainability of MPAs in the region. Climate change, although considered to be diffuse, is also a concern for managers. However, management measures are aimed (predominantly) at preventing overfishing and the overexploitation of terrestrial natural resources. Therefore, coastal erosion, pollution and climate change are only indirectly (and marginally) targeted by these management measures. Moreover, the management measures implemented i.e. monitoring, awareness raising and surveillance are insufficient and mainly aligned with the capacity of the local institutions. However, what is actually needed is more far reaching and adaptive actions to mitigate the current threats. The low financial, technical and human resources largely explain the limited scope of management actions taken. Coupled with the information and data deficit, which increases the inertia regarding threats that have been recurrent for more than a decade, management measures have not been sufficient in managing MPAs in the region. This paper recommends that the links between pressures on MPAs, technical recommendations and resulting management actions must be reinforced.",1,2020,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103936,WOS:000541263200027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

A comparison of fisheries and conservation objectives in three coastal MPAs in Thailand,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,"Mangrove forest ecosystems support aquatic species important to tropical fishing communities, but habitat degradation and over-fishing have caused coastal fishery stocks to decline. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are widely promoted as a management option to reverse this situation. Using swimming crabs as indicator species, this paper explores the ecological effectiveness of two community-led MPAs and one co-managed MPA in Ranong and Phang-nga Provinces in southern Thailand. Comparisons were made of two fisheries objectives: catch per unit effort (CPUE); and size frequency distribution of Portunus spp. and Scylla olivacea; and one conservation objective: catch composition on benthic aquatic species, between each managed area and an associated control site to look for effects of management. Eight replicates of each survey were undertaken in each site: four in the wet season, from May to July 2011; and four in the dry season, from February to March 2012. Two of the MPAs, one a no-take zone and one a gear limitation zone, and both managed by local communities, showed a significant increase in CPUE of target species compared with their controls to the benefit of local fishers. There was little evidence of management impact on the composition of benthic aquatic species so community management is not achieving wider conservation in terms of increased biodiversity. The third MPA, a seasonal no-take zone, co-managed by local communities and local government, showed no significant effect on either CPUE of target species, or composition of benthic aquatic species when compared to its control. For size frequency distribution, a higher abundance of all size classes of Portunus pelagicus was observed in all MPAs compared to their control sites. The size distribution of animals suggests that the community-managed MPAs are supporting recruits and contributing to the fisheries by reducing the rates of growth overfishing. To conclude, the two community-led MPAs benefitted fishers but had no effect on marine biodiversity, while the co-managed MPA did not benefit fishers or marine biodiversity. However, all three MPAs showed increase crab abundance in each size class. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need for a stronger and enforced coordination between fishing and conservation authorities when establishing marine protected areas for conservation purposes. We propose that an appropriate instrument for such coordination is a broad ecosystem-based marine spatial planning procedure, representing neither nature conservation nor fishery. Strategic environmental assessment for plans and programmes and environmental impact assessment for projects are commonly used tools for assessing the environmental impacts of different human activities, but are seldom used for evaluating the environmental effects of capture fisheries. The diversity of fisheries and the drastic effects of some fisheries on the environment are strong arguments for introducing these procedures as valuable supplements to existing fisheries assessment and management tools and able to provide relevant environmental information for an overall marine spatial planning process. Marine protected areas for nature conservation and for protection of fisheries have different objectives. Therefore, the legal procedure when establishing marine protected areas should depend on whether they are established for nature conservation purposes or as a fisheries resource management tool. Fishing in a marine protected area for conservation purpose should be regulated according to conservation law. Also, we argue that marine protected areas for conservation purposes, in the highest protection category, should primarily be established as fully protected marine national parks and marine reserves.",5,2020,10.1007/s13280-019-01279-7,WOS:000529542900007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Identifying effective fisheries management strategies has now become urgent. Here, we developed a spatially explicit metapopulation model accounting for population connectivity in the north-western Mediterranean Sea, and parameterized it for three ecologically and economically important coastal fish species: the white seabreamDiplodus sargus, the two-banded seabreamDiplodus vulgarisand the dusky grouperEpinephelus marginatus. We used the model to assess how stock biomass and catches respond to changes in fishing mortality rate (F) and in the size of fully protected areas within the existing system of multiple-use marine protected areas (MPAs). For each species, we estimated MSY and the corresponding values of stock biomass (B-MSY) and fishing mortality rate (F-MSY), providing crucial reference points for the assessment of fisheries management. Diplodus sargusis currently in low overfishing, whileD. vulgarisandE. marginatusare in high overfishing. Stock recovery toB(MSY)for the last two species requires a reduction of currentFaround 50%. This would guarantee an increase in both stock biomass (around 50% and 75% forD. vulgarisandE. marginatusrespectively) and catch (around 15% and 30%) after a transient time of similar to 15-30 years. Alternatively, doubling the size of fully protected areas over fishable areas within the existing network of MPAs would lead to positive conservation effects for all three species without substantially affecting the overall productivity of the fishery and the total economic value of the catch.

This study tested the effectiveness of VMS on quantifying fishing activity for a near inshore fishery, comprised solely of <12 m vessels, operating within the Poole Harbour MPA (Dorset, UK). VMS data were collected from up to three vessels between 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. Analysis using GIS allowed spatial and temporal comparisons of fishing effort down to 250 m(2) and enabled activity to be overlaid with MPA features. A 10-min reporting interval was determined suitable for quantifying fishing effort at the operational scale of this <12 m fleet. Results showed a decline in overall fishing effort in 2014 and mixed seasonal usage of four defined areas of the Harbour. Fishing effort intensity was lowest during November to February, coinciding with the period of greatest sensitivity for designated features of the MPA and no active fishing was detected within defined sensitive areas for these features. It is concluded that VMS data can be used successfully on the <12 m inshore sector, over small spatial scales, to quantify patterns of activity and detect overlap with MPA features.

Structured questionnaires were administered to small-scale fishers in two fishing communities in northern Peru, exploring their perspectives and attitudes towards compliance motivations as indicators influencing their non-compliant behaviour. Compliance was mostly hindered due to economic hardship, lack of legitimacy towards authorities driven by corruption and low social influence to comply.

The relevance of such community participatory assessment in policy formulation is also discussed in the paper.

An analysis based on the ProtectedSeas database, which includes information on regulated activities, found that 85% of U.S. waters are in managed areas that restrict living resource extraction at some level above generally applicable regulations, with 52% managed at a low level of protection and 3% managed as highly protected no-take areas. States with the most state waters area in no-take MPAs are Hawaii (similar to 25%), California (similar to 9%), and Oregon (similar to 3%). The majority of highly protected areas in U.S. waters exist in low-populated areas of the Pacific, such as the Papahanaumokuakea and Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments. Under a quarter of U.S. waters are closed to bottom trawling, with the West Coast and Alaska each contributing one-third of trawl closures by area. Bottom trawling is prohibited in nearly 90% of West Coast waters. Focusing on waters off California showed that overlapping management and fishing gear restrictions can increase overall protection. In state waters, no-take MPAs account for roughly 9% of the area, while restricted take MPAs of different types cover 27% of the area. About 40% of California state waters are in some kind of MPA, while 13.4% of state waters have a high level of protection from fishing impacts.

We describe a militarised conservation practice in which a marine protected area was established by the state and supported by international actors in a region of ongoing ethnic and military conflict as a case of conservation, by war. Conservation and security actors actively criminalise artisanal fishing communities in Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park in India. The harvest of sea cucumbers, marine species of commercial value historically traded between the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, was banned and has become the target of militarised action. When the Sri Lankan civil war broke out in 1983, sea cucumber trade turned into a security concern as the same sea routes were also being used for trafficking arms, ammunition, and other contraband. Tamil Nadu was geographically and logistically involved in the civil war due to ethnic ties. The Sri Lankan civil war and its social and political consequences on the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu due to ethnic ties is a fitting case of the nexus of conservation and security in a marine context. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews conducted with artisanal fishers and conservation and security actors, we show that violent political conflict provided the justification for securitisation of conservation. As the state focuses its conservation efforts on the marine protected area, commercial fisheries detrimental to fisheries and biodiversity conservation continue. Marine protected areas allow the state to achieve its security outcomes even as it fails to meet its conservation goals due to non-local drivers of declines in species populations.

It is therefore crucial to identify: i) multiscale characteristics that can influence social adaptive capacity of local communities to climate change, and ii) current and future social-ecological conditions related to climate change that might lead communities to experience unsustainable and undesirable states (i.e., socialecological traps). Here, we investigated social adaptive capacity and the relationship to ecological conditions in 29 small-scale fishing communities in Madagascar and Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean. We found that isolation from a market and climate stress had a significant negative relationship with social adaptive capacity, while a higher level of education and the presence of market traders (middlemen) had a positive relationship. In general, resource management through marine protected areas and locally managed marine areas had a positive influence on ecological conditions. Combining social adaptive capacity and ecological conditions revealed that 80 % of fishers households surveyed were experiencing social-ecological states that could lead to unsustainable social-ecological conditions, while 10 % might already be experiencing social-ecological traps.

Our study analyzes a multi-specific artisanal fishery (<10 TGR) operating from La Paloma port (Uruguay, South America) within the MPA of the Rocha Lagoon Protected Landscape (MPA-RLPL) through the temporal assessment (September 2005 to January 2010) of daily catch composition, fishing gear, and fish community dynamics. Seventeen vessels operated inside and outside the MPA-RLPL and they reached 202,773 kg of total catch within that MPA. This amount represents 9.1% of landings registered in La Paloma port during the study period (5 years). Following the seasonal dynamics of catch composition and fishing gears it was revealed a differential use of this coastal protected area by the artisanal fisheries and the fish community. Higher catches of Squatina guggenheim, Mustelus schmitti, Galeorhinus galeus, Urophycis brasiliensis, Paralichtys orbignyanus, and Cynoscion guatucupa occurred from spring-summer, whereas in fall-winter, the higher catches were composed of Micropogonias furnieri (adults and juveniles), Umbrina canosai, Pomatomus saltatrix, and Parona signata.

Squatina guggenheim (a threatened coastal shark), and Micropogonias furnieri (a overexploited bony fish) were the dominant catch in most fishing sets.

People involved in small-scale fisheries (SSF) may incur negative and disproportionate impacts from implementing MPAs, yet limited available data often restricts their representation in MPA planning. Using a Philippines case study, we focus here on the systematic design of a MPA network that aims to minimize and distribute costs equitably for SSF whilst achieving representation targets for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of the study are to: (1) document a participatory mapping approach for collecting SSF data for prioritization using the local knowledge of fishers; and (2) examine how the completeness and resolution of SSF data may affect prioritization outputs in terms of biodiversity representation, spatial efficiency, and distribution equity. In the data-poor region, we conducted participatory mapping workshops with fishers in 79 communities to collect data on the spatial distribution patterns of different SSF fisheries and communities, and employed remote sensing techniques to define coastal habitats, which were targeted for inclusion in MPAs. The datasets were integrated within the decision-support tool Marxan with Zones to develop three scenarios.

All scenarios derived MPA plans that met representation targets with similar area coverage. The outputs, however, varied in terms of distribution equity, measured by the distribution of opportunity costs (loss of fishing grounds) across different fisheries and communities.

Here, we quantified spatial and temporal trends in standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) of two target pelagic species, yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Indian Ocean to analyze the impact of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA's creation in 2010. We applied generalized additive mixed effects models to historical BIOT longline fishery logbooks and official catch and effort statistics from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) to standardize CPUEs and to evaluate long-term trends and distribution patterns across the equatorial Indian Ocean. We find that trends in population indices from within BIOT prior to the MPA's establishment mirror those of the wider Indian Ocean. We also suggest that there may be behavioral plasticity within the yellowfin tuna stock, with some individuals possibly undertaking alternative migration patterns or exhibiting residency behavior within BIOT. Yet, we find no direct evidence of any improvement in standardized CPUE indices of either species in the area surrounding the BIOT MPA, nearly 8 years after its establishment. The average size of yellowfin and bigeye tunas caught both increased after the MPA's establishment. These patterns were also evident across the equatorial Indian Ocean, suggesting that any MPA effect is in combination with other regional drivers, such as behavioral changes in the fishing fleets in response to the threat of Somali Piracy. We therefore conclude that BIOT MPA may be providing local conservation value to tunas, but it is not significant enough to halt the overall regional decline in yellowfin tuna stocks. Thus, we emphasize that large MPAs should be considered in conjunction with other fishery management regulations and wider regional processes, rather than as a silver bullet, in order to provide the conservation and management benefits needed for mobile species like tunas.",4,2020,10.3389/fmars.2020.00318,WOS:000532681900001,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,cpue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

However, a general failure to consider the varying levels of vulnerability of fishers has resulted in MPAs that, often unintentionally, adversely impact small-scale fishers. Furthermore, when fishers lack the capacity to adapt to MPA-related changes, MPAs may fail to meet conservation objectives because fishers do not comply with MPA regulations. In this study, we developed a systematic method to identify individuals who are most vulnerable to being negatively impacted by no-take MPAs through an index that represents individual-level vulnerability. We designed a method for identifying these individuals based on four socioeconomic factors pertaining to vulnerability to MPA changes: livelihood diversity, education, age and wealth, then applied this method in two socially and economically heterogeneous communities in Myanmar's Myeik Archipelago. We used empirical data collected from 80 small-scale fishers in this area to represent each factor, then generated a local-level 'Livelihood Impact Potential Index' (LIPI) that reflects the degree to which a no-take MPA would impact an individual fisher's ability to support his or her livelihood. When attributed to each fisher's most frequented fishing ground, the LIPI can identify locations where no-take MPAs would be most detrimental to small-scale fishers' livelihoods based on their levels of vulnerability.

This paper studies the determinants for the decision of participation in tourism-related activities and examines whether tourism could be regarded as an alternative livelihood for the local people living in the MPAs. The propensity score matching approach is employed and a case study of Nha Trang Bay MPA is used for analysis with data from 140 locals. The results show that the tourism industry in the MPAs does not secure a better income for the local people if they stop their traditional livelihoods and enter the tourism industry. In other words, tourism should not be viewed in isolation with other existing income generating activities. Furthermore, low education, long distances between home and tourism destinations, and the pressure of supporting the whole family are the primary rationales preventing local people living in MPAs from participating in tourism industry.

Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices. These results suggest that communities were developing new social norms and fishing more sustainably before long-term ecological and socioeconomic benefits of fisheries management materialized.",1,2020,10.1111/cobi.13475,WOS:000525791700001,field,CI,2017,MPA,mix,2,,2015,FPA,,mix,mix,,mix,community-based,Phillipines,tropical,Asia,South West Atlantic,mix,,,,,,,,,coastal community,food security,local,local food security,negative,yes,effect size,figure 3,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,3,-0.66,-0.112244898,-0.336734694,-0.673469388,9,redundant indicator,,

Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although they are the ones whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation of cod stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased discarding of juvenile cod. Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective landings control system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

They are frequently promoted as opportunities for win-win outcomes that can both protect biodiversity and lead to economic benefits for affected communities. This win-win view characterizes the dominant discourse surrounding many protected areas. Although this discourse and the arguments derived from it may lead to initial acceptance of conservation interventions, this study shows how it does not necessarily result in compliance and positive attitudes toward specific protected areas. Consequently, the discourse has important implications not just for making the case for protected area implementation, but also for the likelihood of protected areas reaching their objectives. We explain how the win-win discourse influences support for marine protected areas (MPAs) and, ultimately, their success. Using data from focus groups, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews at three MPA sites in the Philippines, we identified three reasons why the win-win discourse can negatively influence prolonged support for MPAs: dashed expectations, inequity, and temptation. Through an understanding of these issues, it becomes possible to suggest improvements that can be made pre-MPA implementation that can lead to prolonged support of MPAs. A focus on less tangible and economic MPA benefits, aligning MPA goals with cultural and social values, and higher levels of transparency when describing MPA outcomes are all ways in which prolonged support of MPAs can be bolstered.",44,2016,10.5751/ES-08204-210136,WOS:000373935100028,field,perception,2014,MPA,"Bonbonon, Candapino, Suba",10,medium,2004,fully,,0.086,0.086,small,NA,community-based,Philippines,tropical,Asia,South China Sea,coral reef,,,,,,,small-scale,,fishery,food security,global,cpue,negative,yes,% interviewees,table 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the MPA designation, there has been an increase in vessels using static gear inside and outside the MPA, with a significant positive trend for vessels using static gear inside the MPA. Over time, static gear landings have decreased by 110 kg per vessel per month, although there has been a significant positive trend over time in value (landings of 1,452 pound per vessel per month), linked to catches of high value species such as lobster, which are associated with the reef ecosystem. Fishing activity providing high volume (weight) and value landings from vessels using mobile demersal gears within the MPA ceased in July 2008. Mobile demersal gear fishing effort has since increased significantly outside the MPA. The value of mobile demersal gear landings in 2017 are comparable to fishing activity prior to the MPA designation, but has not reached the peak landings values of 2008 when the MPA was designated. Fishers predominantly using mobile demersal gear report lower subjective wellbeing and material losses. Static gear fishers report higher levels of subjective wellbeing over time compared to their mobile demersal gear counterparts. Positive subjective wellbeing is pronounced when the fishers are involved with an independent working group.

In addition to this commercial pressure, the impact of recreational activities on fish assemblages remains barely known. Here we examined the impact of spearfishing limitation on resources in a marine protected area (MPA) and the benefit it provides for the local artisanal fishery through the use of a novel indicator. We analysed trends in the fish assemblage composition using artisanal fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR), a Mediterranean MPA where the spearfishing activity has been forbidden over 15% of its area. Fish species were pooled into three response groups according to their target level by spearfishing. We developed the new flexible ReGS indicator reflecting shifts in species assemblages according to the relative abundance of each response group facing external pressure. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased by ca. 60% in the BSNR between 2000 and 2007, while the MPA was established in 1999. The gain of CPUE strongly depended on the considered response group: for the highly targeted group, the CPUE doubled while the CPUE of the untargeted group increased by only 15.5%. The ReGS value significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.45 (on a scale between 0 and 1) in the general perimeter of this MPA while it has reached a threshold of 0.43, considered as a reference point, in the area protected from spearfishing since 1982. Our results demonstrated that limiting recreational fishing by appropriate zoning in multiple-use MPAs represents a real benefit for artisanal fisheries.

One prevailing solution is to generate cost-minimizing marine conservation strategies using static spatial prioritization tools. However, there is a need to understand the social-ecological impacts of considering dynamics. We applied a grid-based dynamic model with biological and fleet sub-models, and examined the social-ecological effects of three cost-minimizing conservation strategies over a 20-year planning horizon (medium term), incorporating dynamics in fish populations and fisher behaviors, and associated uncertainties. This study shows a trade-off among cost minimization conservation strategies between conservation and socio-economic benefits. Estimated opportunity costs were different between static and dynamic methods, highlighting the necessity to include dynamic costs as an extra source in decision-making. We caution that relying solely on opportunity costs as the criterion to guide conservation practices can be misleading as it may fail to reflect overarching social-ecological objectives. The study contributes to a further understanding of prevailing strategies' potentials and limitations, and equips practitioners with a dynamic perspective to choose the best conservation strategy.",1,2020,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108512,WOS:000526787400018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

Growth in marine tourism is now furthered through the 'blue growth' imperative, which this article problematises. The paper argues that there are already existing sustainability issues related to the marine tourism sector. These problems could be exacerbated if growth is additionally boosted. Since the social sustainability consequences of the growth of marine tourism are less known in the sustainability science literature, this paper thematically synthesises these types of sustainability problems in particular, as presented in the tourism studies, and brings them closer to sustainability science readers. The cases of cruise tourism, ecotourism, and tourism in marine protected areas, and community-based tourism studies are examined, wherein the latter represents a critical case for social sustainability matters. The paper reports several social and environmental injustices, produced through structural forces, and a manipulated access to natural resources, health services, and healthy environments. Social sustainability issues are most obvious in cruise tourism; however, also tourism in marine protected areas, ecotourism, and community-based tourism are not unproblematic. Thus, blue growth initiatives should be carefully examined and questioned.",4,2020,10.1007/s11625-020-00796-9,WOS:000522944900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

Further, these protected areas face the challenge of protecting highly-mobile pelagic species that move between protected areas in different countries and across fishing zones. In general. the dissociation that commonly exists between academic and conservation groups, which work under different objectives and reward systems, serves as an obstacle for producing the information that is needed by wildlife managers. This limitation is further enhanced in oceanic islands, such as Isla del Coco because of their mere remoteness, a condition that dramatically increases the economic and operational costs for doing research.

Results: In order to produce the scientific information that these areas require, it is necessary to: i) distinguish between biologically relevant information, and information required for decision-making, ii) generate information about the threats to biodiversity, even in the absence of information about the species themselves, iii) establish clear goals and objectives for monitoring plans, and iv) build strong links between two types of groups: those that work from mainland and those that operate offshore; this includes working alongside fishing vessels. Conclusions: It will be a great challenge to articulate such relationships between groups, but this option seems more viable (in terms of associated logistic and economical costs) than attempting to collect the required data from an isolated academic platform. Also, this articulation appears to be the only way of generating information that is crucial for stock management, such as the accurate characterization of the fishing activity.",0,2020,,WOS:000532610600001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

Case studies around the world have demonstrated that merging indigenous hunting knowledge with community-based conservation approaches is often complementary to biodiversity conservation. A combination of such approaches improves wildlife conservation practices and livelihood strategies while enhancing communities' social-ecological resilience. However, if mismanaged, such approaches lead to negative results in the community, such as an increased exposure/vulnerability to corruption, power inequality among interest groups, as well as mismanagement of wildlife species. We explore the existence of hunting-specific traditional ecological knowledge and the contribution of such knowledge to wildlife management in the case of community-based conservation in Tajikistan. We reviewed hunting-related literature from 1850 to 1950, conducted interviews, and accompanied hunters in the field to document their ecological knowledge of the Gomo-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO), also known as the Pamir region of Tajikistan. Throughout our research, we found that there exists a rich body of hunter-specific ecological knowledge of hunting norms, ethics, taboos, and belief systems in the Pamir region of Tajikistan. Traditional hunters largely accepted a community-based conservation approach because it resonates with their subsistence hunting practices. Also, combining traditional hunter knowledge with a community-based conservation approach created an opportunity for knowledge sharing, improved the quality of scientific wildlife surveys, and led to better collaboration among conservancies and other conservation NGOs. More importantly, such approaches empowered and incentivized local traditional hunters to take responsibility for wildlife management.",1,2020,10.5751/ES-11253-250101,WOS:000524149700003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not marine area,

Together, the five frontiers chart a potential new research agenda for coastal well-being and ecosystem services research, namely one that involves more cases and authors from the Global South, that explicitly explores social differentiation and changes overtime, that is collaborative from the start, and that engages empirically with the complexity and uncertainty of well-being-ecosystem service interactions and their implications for enhancing management.

Most MPA papers, including those examining MPA effectiveness, focus on just a few aspects of well-being in the context of a sub-set of stakeholders, and consider only a single type of MPA. They mostly focus on conventional objective measures that are not comprehensive or systematically selected. This review argues for a systematic and integrative framework to ensure future MPA assessments are equipped to capture MPAs' contributions to human well-being more adequately and comprehensively. Such a framework can also allow for cross-MPA comparisons that can capture differences in well-being across different types of MPAs, and information gained can be useful for MPA practitioners and policy makers, particularly in reaching current global targets, such as the CBD, Aichi Target 11.",9,2020,10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.101048,WOS:000509730300008,systematic,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, assesses knowledge gaps and methods without analyzing the direction of outcomes

For fisheries targeting highly mobile species, the economic impact of a closure may by highly dynamic, depending on the current suitability of the closed area for the target species. We present an analysis to quantify the fine-scale economic impact of time-area closures: the 'lost economic opportunity', which is the percentage of total potential profit for an entire fishing season that occurs within and during a time-area closure. Our analysis integrates a spatially explicit and environment-informed catch model with a utility model that quantifies fishing revenues and costs, and thus incorporates a dynamic target species distribution in the estimated economic impact of a closure. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating the economic impact of the Loggerhead Conservation Area (LCA) on California's drift gillnet swordfish Xiphias gladius fishery. The lost economic opportunity due to the LCA time-area closure ranged from 0% to 6% per season, with variation due to port location and trip duration, as well as inter-annual changes in swordfish distribution. This increased by 40%-90% when a seasonally varying swordfish price was considered. There was a clear signal in economic impact associated with a shift from warm to cool conditions in the California Current following the 1998 El Nino, with increased lost economic opportunity from 1999. This signal was due to higher swordfish catch inside the LCA during the cool phase, associated with increased water column mixing, and due to higher catches outside the LCA in the warmer phase, associated with increased sea-surface temperature. Synthesis and applications. We found small economic impact from a fishery closure, but with meaningful inter-annual variation due to environmental change and the dynamic distribution of a target species. Our approach could be used to help determine the timing of closures, simulate impacts of proposed closures and, more generally, assess some economic consequences of climate-induced shifts in species' ranges.",5,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13565,WOS:000510251400001,model,,,ABMT,closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,incomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

However, reconciling these biodiversity targets with socio-economic demands remains a great dilemma for implementing conservation policies. In this paper, Aichi Targets 11 and 12 were simultaneously addressed using Brazil's exclusive economic zone as an example. Priority areas for expanding the current system of marine protected areas within the country's eight marine ecoregions were identified with data on threatened vertebrates under different scenarios. Additionally, the potential effects of major socio-economic activities (small- and large-scale fishing, seabed mining, and oil and gas exploration) on the representation of conservation features in proposed marine protected areas were explored. Areas selected for expanding marine protected areas solely based on biodiversity data were different (spatial overlap from 62% to 93%) from areas prioritized when socio-economic features were incorporated into the analysis. The addition of socio-economic data in the prioritization process substantially decreased opportunity costs and potential conservation conflicts, at the cost of reducing significantly (up to 31%) the coverage of conservation features.

Balancing trade-offs between local economic demands, preservation of traditional values, and maintenance of both biodiversity and ecosystem resilience is a challenge for reef managers and resource users. Consistently, growing reef tourism sectors offer more lucrative livelihoods than subsistence and artisanal fisheries at the cost of traditional heritage loss and ecological damage. Using a systematic review of coral reef fishery reconstructions since the 1940s, we show that declining trends in fisheries catch and fish stocks dominate coral reef fisheries globally, due in part to overfishing of schooling and spawning-aggregating fish stocks vulnerable to exploitation. Using a separate systematic review of coral reef tourism studies since 2013, we identify socio-ecological impacts and economic opportunities associated to the industry. Fisheries and tourism have the potential to threaten the ecological stability of coral reefs, resulting in phase shifts toward less productive coral-depleted ecosystem states. We consider whether four common management strategies (unmanaged commons, ecosystem-based management, co-management, and adaptive co-management) fulfil ecological conservation and socioeconomic goals, such as living wage, job security, and maintenance of cultural traditions. Strategies to enforce resource exclusion and withhold traditional resource rights risk social unrest; thus, the coexistence of fisheries and tourism industries is essential. The purpose of this chapter is to assist managers and scientists in their responsibility to devise implementable strategies that protect local community livelihoods and the coral reefs on which they rely.",2,2020,10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_13,WOS:000582468900013,field,,,ABMT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas

However, the effective use of MPAs depends upon the successful integration of social and ecological information. We investigated relationships between the social system structure of coastal communities alongside biological data describing the status and trends in fish communities around Yap, Micronesia. Traditional marine tenure made Yap an ideal place to investigate the underlying principles of social-ecological systems, as communities own and manage spatially-defined coastal resources. Analysis of social survey data revealed three social regimes, which were linked to corresponding gradients of ecological outcomes. Communities with decentralized decision-making and a preference for communal forms of fishing had the greatest ecological outcomes, while communities lacking any form of leadership were linked to poor ecological outcomes. Interestingly, communities with strong top-down leadership were shown to have variable ecological outcomes, depending on the presence of key groups or individuals. We last investigated whether social perception could successfully predict the status of fish assemblages within non-managed reefs. Several biological metrics of fish assemblages within non-managed areas were significantly predicted by a gradient of human access, suggesting social perception could not predict the growing human footprint over the study period. These findings highlight the potentially overlooked role that community-oriented decision-making structures and fishing methods could play in successful conservation efforts, and the limitations of perception data.

We designed an integer linear programming model to quantify tradeoffs among five marine reserve network aspects: ecological conservation value, economic opportunity cost, geographic domain size, total reserve area, and reserve spatial compactness. Using ecological and economic data from the Hawaiian deepwater bottomfish fishery as a case study, an integer linear programming model was designed to choose areas that 1) maximize conservation value and 2) minimize opportunity cost, defined as foregone fisheries revenue. Compromise solutions that equally weighted conservation value and opportunity cost resulted in solutions with dramatically lower foregone fisheries revenue and a relatively small loss in conservation value compared to solutions with the maximum conservation value. When opportunity cost was assumed uniform across the spatial domain, solutions had considerably higher foregone revenue for a given level of conservation value, highlighting the drawback of not including a spatially explicit metric of opportunity cost in reserve selection models. Inclusion of only indicator species, rather than the entire species complex, in the optimization led to considerable representation gaps in conservation value for non-included species. We found that optimizations performed at the archipelago scale provided geographically disproportionate reserve allocations and thus disproportionate conservation benefits and socioeconomic impacts across geopolitically distinct island regions.

In this context, the potential use of local ecological fisher knowledge from the Marine Extractive Reserve of Corumbau (MERC) in northeastern Brazil was evaluated regarding the shifting baseline of the lane snapper Lutjanus synagris. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 222 fishers who identified L. synagris as the main fish resource used in MERC. The relationship between the maximum L. synagris weight caught on the best fishing day among fishers of different age categories was not significant (p = 0.306). However, older fishers significantly (p < 0.001) reported a higher time span since their best day catch. In addition, older fishers were significantly more perceptive (p = 0.013) to declining L. synagris abundance over time than younger fishers, who mostly reported that this species abundance is stable or has even increased over time. These results highlight an existing shifting baseline phenomenon for the L. synagris fishery in the region. Only 22.5% of the respondents, mostly younger fishers, expressed a need to establish specific management rules for the species. The proposed strategies for local L. synagris management included establishing a closed period, defining minimum catch sizes and creating new No-Take Zones specifically for this species protection. Trust bonds between fishers and fisheries managers, as well as scientists, require strengthening, and fisher knowledge can serve as a basis for building local targets for species conservation.",1,2020,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105025,WOS:000502881300016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

This network provides a rare opportunity to examine spatial and temporal trends in TURF use and impacts on surrounding open access areas (OAAs). In this analysis, landings of keyhole limpet (Fissurella spp.), kelp (Lessonia spp.) and red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus) were used to estimate catch-per-unit effort (CPUEs) and catch-per-unit area (CPUAs) indices inside and outside TURFs by fishing cove. For these species, CPUEs and CPUAs in 2015 were significantly higher inside TURFs. However, temporal trends analyzed with a linear mixed effects model indicate that CPUAs inside TURFs have been significantly decreasing since 2000 for keyhole limpet, red sea urchin and for loco (Concholepas concholepas), while in OAAs this measure only decreased for limpet. An elastic net regression was used to better explain catches in OAAs during 2015, including a variety of variables related to the characteristics and activity of proximal TURFs. Results indicate that exogenous factors unrelated to TURF management were the primary drivers of catches in OAAs during 2015 but that factors related to proximal TURFs appear to have a slight negative impact that grows over time. Collectively, these results indicate that while TURFs are associated with higher catch rates than surrounding OAAs, catch rates appear to be decreasing over time and, though limited, the impact of TURFs on surrounding OAAs may be negative.

When applied to the legally ambiguous and interconnected marine environment this is magnified. The lack of clear guidance for transboundary marine conservation from the international conservation community exacerbates this problem, leaving individual initiatives to develop their own governance arrangements. Yet, well-managed transboundary marine protected areas (MPAs) have the potential to contribute significantly to global conservation aims. Conversely, in a period where there is increasing interest in marine resources and space from all sectors, the designation of MPAs can create or amplify a regional conflict. In some instances, states have used MPAs to extend rights over disputed marine resources, restrict the freedom of others and establish sovereignty over maritime space. Six case studies were taken from Europe, North Africa and the Middle East to illustrate how states have interpreted and utilized different legislative mechanisms to either come together or diverge over the governance of marine resources or maritime space. Each of the case studies illustrates how different actors have used the same legislative tools, but with different interpretations and applications, to justify their claims. It is clear that the role of science combined with a deeper engagement with stakeholders can play a critical role in tempering conflict between states. Where states are willing to cooperate, the absence of clear guidelines at the global level means that often ad hoc measures are put into place, with the international frameworks then playing catch up. Balancing different jurisdictional claims with the conservation of the marine environment, whilst considering the increasing special economic interests will become increasingly difficult. Developing a transboundary conservation tool, such as the simple conservation caveats found in the Barcelona Convention and Antarctic Convention, which allow for the establishment of intergovernmental cooperation without prejudicing any outstanding jurisdictional issue, would provide a framework for the development of individual transboundary MPAs.",3,2019,10.3389/fmars.2019.00759,WOS:000502971300001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

The evaluation was a participatory process that involved several institutions: academe, an externally-funded project, local governments, national government agencies and research organizations. Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys.

In response, many countries have committed through the Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity to conserve 10% of the marine environment through ecologically representative and equitably managed MPAs by 2020. The rush to fulfill this commitment has raised concerns on how increasing MPA coverage will affect other elements of Target 11, including representation and equity. We examined a Philippines case study to assess and compare 3 MPA planning approaches for biodiversity representation and equitable distribution of costs to small-scale fishers. In the opportunistic approach, MPAs were identified and supported by coastal communities. The donor-assisted approach used local knowledge to select MPAs through a national-scale and donor-assisted conservation project. The systematic conservation planning approach identified MPA locations with the spatial prioritization software Marxan with Zones to achieve biodiversity objectives with minimal costs to fishers. We collected spatial data on biodiversity and fisheries features and performed a gap analysis to evaluate MPAs derived from different approaches. We assessed representation based on the proportion of biodiversity features conserved in MPAs and distribution equity by the distribution of opportunity costs (fishing areas lost in MPAs) among fisher stakeholder groups. The opportunistic approach did not ineffectively represent biodiversity and resulted in inequitable costs to fishers. The donor-assisted approach affected fishers disproportionately but provided near-optimal regional representation. Only the systematic approach achieved all representation targets with minimal and equitable costs to fishers.

Given the recent motivations for countries to adopt large-scale marine spatial planning approaches, ensuring these plans are grounded in social-ecological resilience theories is essential for long-term success. Drawing upon recent academic attention from a range of disciplinary areas, this review explores current practices and applied examples of published case studies from around the world that have integrated social and ecological spatial information using GIS techniques. This review intended to use these case studies to guide directions of future MSP research that considers social-ecological resilience theories. Five overall themes were uncovered. First, extractive uses, such as fisheries, were often given priority in MSP processes, which even though important, may undermine the social resilience of coastal communities by not supporting the diversity of non-extractive economies. Second, the quality of ecological spatial data used in the studies varied greatly, often with little consideration of how ongoing human demands may influence long-term ecological resilience. Thrid, many GIS techniques were used to integrate social and ecological data including: descriptive maps, site prioritisation techniques, and predictive modelling. Lastly, only a small number of studies considered cross-ecosystem influences and only two incorporated potential climate change impacts on social institutions and marine ecosystems. Overall, there is a need for progressing GIS predictive modelling techniques to assess and link the responses of social and ecological systems to MSP solutions in order to support long-term social-ecological resilience.",5,2019,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103657,WOS:000495518700035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Following recent calls to expand this concept to marine spaces, this paper has used political ecology and in particular its focus on power and access to explore how capitalist expansion has impacted the means and methods of access to key resources in a small-scale marine fishing community in Ghana. The findings of the paper are based upon an eight-month field visit to Aboadze in the Western Region of Ghana, a traditional fishing community that is considered a 'closing' frontier, on account of recent research that suggests the small-pelagic fish stocks will collapse within a decade. The findings of the paper show that accessing fish and other necessary resources such as gear and capital has become increasingly difficult as stocks continue to dwindle, and those living in the case study community have to resort to unsustainable fishing methods in order to survive. The paper also finds that the vulnerability caused by decades of overfishing by foreign trawlers is felt disproportionately by certain members of the community, compounding existing vulnerabilities that arise through gender and class.",4,2019,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103621,WOS:000495518700014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

Economic studies can contribute to the debate about MPAs as a management option by evaluating their benefits and costs to society. In this paper, we outline how to evaluate the economic benefits and costs of MPAs and provide examples from the literature to demonstrate the methods described. We review challenges and opportunities of different economic methods. One key challenge is to meaningfully compare market and non-market benefits of MPAs-this comparison is complicated by the scarcity of studies that quantify the non-market benefits of MPAs. Another key challenge is to quantify how the value of marine areas may change with and without MPAs. Costs are often easier to estimate than benefits, but some costs-such as maintenance and compliance costs-are rarely recognized. Analytical choices will influence the identified economic costs and benefits of MPAs. For example, the spatial extent of analyses will influence what changes in underlying ecological processes are captured and conclusions about the equitable distribution of costs and benefits across society. For these reasons, it is important that managers are aware of the challenges and opportunities described here, so that they can obtain and use the best-quality economic information to guide decision making about MPAs.",2,2019,10.1002/ecs2.2879,WOS:000493528200011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Until recently most of the expansion was concentrated in the Amazon region (with useful lessons). It also had an uneven ecological representation of coastal and marine ecosystems, concentrated in coastal waters. Despite significant advances, the levels of funding, staff and stakeholders' engagement remain relatively low for such a vast system. Within the past few years, key elements of a new strategy for protection of coastal and marine areas have started to emerge, combined with some participatory processes and a focus on expansion of the total area protected (from <1.5% protection of the country's marine area). These included: a renewed focus on priority areas for conservation; attention to national and international commitments and targets; clarity about the need for partnerships and funding; better engagement of Brazilian society and stakeholders; new, and more collaborative, models of protected areas management and conservation; and openness in the relationships with wider society. Significant results of this effort have started to appear: new large mosaics of oceanic protected areas were created; Amazon mangroves were recognized by the Ramsar Convention; new mangrove protected areas were created, besides other ones proposed; project proposals are under development with partners for better funding and sharing of responsibility; and there is a better engagement with stakeholders. The building of the Brazilian Blue Initiative is underway. The implementation of the proposed 15-year marine strategy is at its onset: partnerships need to be strengthened and substantial funding is required. It will only be possible to manage the larger system of protected areas if there are more collaborative and innovative models for protected areas and conservation management. These should include partnerships with civil society, local and traditional communities and the private sector, as well as greater engagement of scientists and research institutions, stronger and more qualified tourism, volunteer work, etc. Further innovative funding mechanisms will also be needed along the way.",2,2019,10.1002/aqc.3169,WOS:000491946500006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations,

They are, however, declining globally at an unprecedented rate. The damaging effects on Zostera marina (Common Eelgrass) seagrass beds in UK waters from mechanical recreational boating activities, namely anchoring and traditional swing mooring scour, suggest that measures of implementing management to mitigate human impacts need prioritising. Eco-moorings, a design that reduces the abrasion pressure of anchoring and mooring on the seabed, are such a mitigation method. In the UK, limited test sites and a lack of social acceptance of the technology compounds the limited uptake of eco-moorings to date. To advance the evidence base, this study focusses on a bespoke eco-mooring design deployed in 2017 to protect seagrass beds within a popular anchorage in Southwest England. We assess the behavioural and social responses of recreational boaters to the trial eco-mooring through 1) mapping of boating activity pre- and post-deployment and 2) structured questionnaires both on-site and online to local and national audiences respectively. Results of mapped boating activity demonstrated a shoreward distribution shift of anchoring away from the deployed eco-mooring, with 45.4% of all anchoring vessels directly within or within a range of potential influence of the seagrass bed. Through the deployment of the eco-mooring (where no mooring previously existed), an estimated additional 20% of anchoring pressure was alleviated from the seagrass bed. A total of 89.6% of on-site respondents reacted positively to the prospect of further eco-moorings being deployed locally. When questioned, 74.6% of on-site and 82.8% of online respondents demonstrated a preference for the physical action of mooring a vessel over anchoring. This suggests that implementation of eco-moorings in seagrass-dense regions could successfully alleviate anchor damage, especially where over half of respondents indicated an awareness of seagrass presence prior to anchoring their vessel and/or hesitance to cease visiting preferential anchoring sites (sheltered bays). This study recommends targeting conservation guidance at the powerboat community, the dominant group anchoring/mooring in the study area and identified as not currently engaged in seagrass education campaigns. It is proposed that management introduce incentives such as free of charge eco-moorings and/or anchoring charges in Marine Protected Areas/Voluntary No Anchor Zones to conserve and recover seagrass and other sensitive seabed habitats nationally.",1,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104906,WOS:000488139200002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

However, MPA performance is likely to be compromised if people who depend on fishing are excluded from MPA design decision making. Participatory MPA design helps to address this problem by engaging local stakeholders in all critical decisions, including the total coverage, placement, and local size of no-take marine reserves. Here, we report the findings from a participatory MPA design project on Selayar Island, Indonesia, in which a community initiated collaborations with scientists to access modern quantitative tools for community-led MPA scenario testing. The outcomes highlight a local disagreement between ecologically and socially desirable MPA designs. Focused on social considerations, the initial community-supported MPA design consisted of four small reserves (0.5-1 km wide) in predominately southern community waters, where they were intended to restrict external fishers. Ecologically optimal MPA designs, in contrast, consisted of one or two large reserves (4-6 km wide) in northern community waters, where they were expected to restrict primarily local fishers but better support the rebuilding of fish populations and fisheries. However, ecologically optimal MPA designs were socially infeasible. Using quantitative MPA performance assessments, the community negotiated an alternative MPA design consisting of two 1.5-2 km wide reserves at socially and ecologically favorable locations. Compared to the initial proposal, this revised MPA design was estimated (1) to protect three to four times more individuals of key fishery species within reserve boundaries and (2) to double local fishery catches. We conclude that even simple MPA design tools, which quantify and visualize local conservation and fishery outcomes under alternative MPA scenarios, add value to participatory decision making and likely MPA performance.",1,2019,10.5751/ES-11209-240406,WOS:000506574000024,field,perception,NA,MPA,Bungaiya,NA,NA,NA,fully,,NA,NA,NA,no,community-based,Indonesia,tropical,Asia,South China Sea,coral reef,,,,,,,,,coastal community,agency,,decision making,positive,no,community-based MPA,text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes, including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2) shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures, compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance.

However, their effectiveness for coral reef fisheries management is often questionable because most of these MPAs are small and ineffectively managed. In this study, we assessed the fish biomass of commercially important coral reef fishes (e.g. surgeonfish (family Acanthuridae), parrotfish (subfamily Scarinae), snapper (family Lutjanidae), grouper (subfamily Epinephelinae), sweetlips (family Haemulidae), goatfish (Mullidae) and emperor (family Lethrinidae)) in 57 locally managed MPAs in the Philippines. We used the fish biomass level at the nationally managed, large (332.0 km(2)), remote, old and well enforced (i.e. strictly protected for > 20 years) Tubbataha Reefs National Marine Park (TRNMP) as a proxy for unfished ecosystems (B-o). We considered fish biomass levels between 25 and 50% of B-o as biomass within the maximum sustainable yield for multi-species coral reef fisheries (B-MMSY) (McClanahan et al., 2014). Results showed that fish biomass levels in 7%, 25% and 68% of the surveyed MPAs were above B-MMSY, within Bmivisv and below B-MMSY , respectively. None of the reefs outside MPAs was above B-MMSY. About 86% were below B-MMSY and the rest of the 14% of the sites outside MPAs were within B-MMSY (14%). The mean ( +/- S.E.) fish biomass levels on reefs inside and outside MPAs were only about 20.4 +/- 2.2% and 10.9 +/- 1.3%, respectively, of the TRNMP level. Neither size nor age of MPAs was significantly associated with fish biomass. Overall, our study showed that the current locally managed MPAs are not effective enough for coral reef fisheries management but, nonetheless, better than having no MPA at all.",6,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104831,WOS:000486105500007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing, ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest, located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys, interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the governance was related with the equity level of the actors.

Through narrative responses elicited during interviews with village residents, coupled with ethnographic vignettes from a key interlocutor in the village, the paper reveals peoples diverse perspectives on village out-migration. In doing so, it interrogates the claim that the marine park has forced people to out-migrate. Some respondents explained that men generally engage in circular forms of labour-related mobility in the context of seasonal fishing activities and short-term business ventures. Others said that people choose to out-migrate due to everyday hardships, leaving in search of a good life. These narrative responses are at once commentaries on the macro-level political and economic drivers of rural out-migration, and on respondent's micro-level aspirations for future socioeconomic autonomy. Thus, they are both expressions of structural constraint and individual agency. While very few interviewees believed that people were forced to migrate because of the marine park, most respondents contended that it had deepened preexisting experiences of a hard life, and exacerbated lived experiences of vulnerability. However, migration has historically been woven into the sociocultural fabric of the community, and there are broader trends of rural population mobility in Tanzania, and fisher mobility in coastal areas, which long pre-date the establishment of the park.

However, the ability for periodic closures to also support high fisheries yields and healthy marine ecosystems is uncertain, despite increased promotion of periodic closures for managing fisheries and conserving ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific. We developed a bioeconomic fisheries model that considers changes in fish wariness, based on empirical field research, and quantified the extent to which periodic closures can simultaneously maximize harvest efficiency, fisheries yield and conservation of fish stocks. We found that periodic closures with a harvest schedule represented by closure for one to a few years between a single pulse harvest event can generate equivalent fisheries yield and stock abundance levels and greater harvest efficiency than achievable under conventional fisheries management with or without a permanent closure. Optimality of periodic closures at maximizing the triple objective of high harvest efficiency, high fisheries yield, and high stock abundance was robust to fish life history traits and to all but extreme levels of overfishing. With moderate overfishing, there emerged a trade-off between periodic closures that maximized harvest efficiency and no-take permanent closures that maximized yield; however, the gain in harvest efficiency outweighed the loss in yield for periodic closures when compared with permanent closures. Only with extreme overfishing, where fishing under nonspatial management would reduce the stock to <= 18% of its unfished level, was the harvest efficiency benefit too small for periodic closures to best meet the triple objective compared with permanent closures. Synthesis and applications. We show that periodically harvested closures can, in most cases, simultaneously maximize harvest efficiency, fisheries yield, and fish stock conservation beyond that achievable by no-take permanent closures or nonspatial management. Our results also provide design guidance, indicating that short closure periods between pulse harvest events are most appropriate for well-managed fisheries or areas with large periodic closures, whereas longer closure periods are more appropriate for small periodic closure areas and overfished systems.",7,2019,10.1111/1365-2664.13417,WOS:000478601300007,model,,,ABMT,closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Fieldwork was carried out during 2013-2015 in Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas MPA (CPH-MPA) using a mixed method approach involving the collection and analysis of data from institutional surveys and community meetings. The analysis shows that the fishers' self-perception of having low influence in decision-making is consistent with the perception towards fishers of the wider social system. Several barriers and constraints to participation in CPH-MPA management are identified. The inefficient structure of the information exchange network further explained fishers' feelings of distrust and marginalisation regarding decision-making. Understanding how structural barriers make it difficult to set in motion a collective learning process necessary for an efficient decision-making process breaks new ground for the design of interventions.

However, the theory of marine reserves indicates that reserves are more likely to benefit fisheries in areas of heavy fishing activity that would otherwise be overfished. Whether or not fishing catch is calculated as a cost depends on the balance of conservation and fisheries goals for a reserve, and thus is critical for policymakers to consider when designing marine reserve networks. This research shows the utility of running an inverted cost model of fishery catches during marine reserve spatial prioritization as a first step In a marine planning process oriented towards stabilizing local fisheries. This technique serves as a heuristic tool that may help conservation planners explore regions that would otherwise be overlooked if fisheries data were absent or integrated purely as a cost in the planning process. Drawing on data from Madagascar to illustrate our approach, this research demonstrates that the regions most frequently selected using the inverted cost model not only meet conservation targets, but are also those most accessible to community-based resource managers, the dominant management paradigm in Madagascar as well as in many developing countries.",0,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104824,WOS:000477784400020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framewok,

Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit.

Whilst there are differences between these nations in terms of geography, history, and politico-legal systems, the majority are developing countries with limited technical and financial resources to implement laws for marine conservation and management. Despite these limitations all the small island states have laws for marine protected areas (MPAs) in one form or another. Because these countries also rely heavily on the coastal zone and marine resources in terms of subsistence and livelihoods for local communities, the extent to which the law accommodates civil society interests, and involvement in decision-making and management, is critical. Although some studies have explored law and policy relevant to MPAs in individual countries, rarely have countries across the Indo-Pacific region been compared. By doing so, different approaches and success stories can be shared, as well as legislative gaps and challenges addressed. This paper outlines the legal frameworks that provide for the establishment and management of MPAs in a selection of small island states across the Indo Pacific.

I contend that pre-existing and conservation-induced conditions of poverty drive the continued use of DFG inside the MPA. Such circumstances are framed by colonial and post-independence state-level development policies. They are also textured by breakdowns in customary marine tenure practices, changing beliefs about which types of fishing gear villagers consider to be traditional, and community-defined moral rights to fish for the fulfilment of basic material needs.

However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population.

Marine protected areas are increasingly proposed for use by researchers and managers, in combination with or separate from traditional fishery management techniques (e.g., harvest quotas, size quotas, etc.), to improve this situation. Marine reserves, also known as no-take zones, are the strictest of these protected areas. We review published and government documents that explore the costs and benefits of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve - a recently-created marine reserve that is part of the much larger Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary - to three major groups of stakeholders: commercial users, recreational users, and agency personnel. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty in all cases, identifying and quantifying economic costs is more straightforward than quantifying benefits, in part because they are more well-known and more short-term in nature. The costs of creating and managing this reserve are minor on the scale of the economy of Monroe Country, Florida, but benefits, although real, are unlikely to impact stakeholders in the short-term and are thus tenuous. In some cases, direct economic incentives for those few individuals suffering direct costs (i.e., commercial interests) are recommendable. In the absence of such, and given the disparate nature of costs and benefits associated with the creation of marine reserves, adaptive and interactive management approaches, combined with traditional fishery management techniques, are recommended to achieve policy and management goals. This includes ongoing public education, outreach, and stakeholder analysis over time (coupled with strict law enforcement within reserves) if the ultimate goal of improving the sustainability of habitat and fisheries in surrounding waters is to be achieved.",13,2005,,WOS:000232940000010,field,BA,2002,MPA,Florida Keys,5,medium,1997,PPA,NA,35,51,medium,NA,state,USA,subtropical,North America,North West Atlantic,mix,,,,,,,,,recreational,assets,economic,employment,negative,yes,% employment change,p393,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,-0.055517328,,,,,regulation of the park changed multiple times since,,

A Thai case study,FISHERIES RESEARCH,,"Some recommendations made by the World Parks Congress in Durban (2003) underscore the need to consider the impacts of multi-purpose marine protected areas (MPAs) on resident or adjacent populations, and lead social and fisheries scientists to reconsider their approaches and methods regarding the assessment of economic effects of an MPA. This paper contributes to this reconsideration by proposing an assessment method of microeconomic effects. The approach is the comparison of fishing households' economic situation in Chumphon Province (Thailand) at a given time based on their location in relation to a marine protected area: within or adjacent to Chumphon Archipelago Marine National Park vs. remote from it. We address three economic dimensions: the profitability of household activities, the income-distributional effects among households and the household vulnerability. This assessment requires the calculation of five indicators: the net income, the net profit margin, the Gini coefficient and the Herfindahl index, and Bene's vulnerability index. From a dataset made up of 123 fishing households surveyed twice a year, the main results show higher incomes and less economic vulnerability for households located within or adjacent to the MPA, and a more inegalitarian income distribution among households located remote from the MPA. So, the households located within or adjacent to the MPA have more security, can stay focused on the most profitable fishing activities and not have to diversify outside of the fishing sector. In an environment where commercial small-scale fishing was already highly developed, setting up an MPA could have the effect of sustaining an efficient, specialised professional set-up for fishing households in the area concerned. With respect to a policy to establish MPAs in keeping with the Durban recommendations, this study shows that a thorough analysis of profitability, income distribution and economic vulnerability should help to identify who the Winners and losers might be, which could improve the targeting of mitigation and compensation measures.

It is now becoming more evident that an equal focus on the ecological and social aspects is required. Without the collection of information about social aspect such as impacts and sharing this as well as ecological information with communities, MPAs are at higher risk of opposition and social acceptability problems. This paper explores the development of a wellbeing framework to understand the social aspects, including the impacts of MPAs on the wellbeing of local communities. This research investigates two case study MPAs: Cape Byron and Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Parks in New South Wales, Australia. The MPAs are multiple-use and were implemented in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The research began with a review of the literature, followed by fieldwork, including semi-structured qualitative interviews with community members. Through thematic coding of the interview transcripts in light of the literature on assessing the social impacts of MPAs, a community wellbeing framework of domains and associated attributes was developed to investigate social impacts. Our analysis shows; first, local perspectives are crucial to understanding social impacts. Second, understanding social impacts gives insight into the nature of trade-offs that occur in decision-making regarding MPAs. Third, the intangible social impacts experienced by local communities are just as significant as the tangible ones for understanding how MPAs operate. Fourth, governance impacts have been the most influential factor affecting the social acceptability of the case study parks. We argue that failure to address negative social impacts can undermine the legitimacy of MPAs. We propose that the framework will support policymakers to work towards more effective, equitable and socially sustainable MPAs by employing much-needed monitoring of human dimensions of conservation interventions at the community level to shape adaptive management.",0,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0244605,WOS:000605651300032,field,perception,2017,MPA,"Cape Byron, Port Stephens",10,medium,2007,PPA,,mix,mix,mix,NA,NA,Australia,subtropical,Oceania,South West Pacific,mix,,,,,,,,,coastal community,food security,local,local food security,negative,no,reduces subsitence fishing and locally sourced seafood,table 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,indicator not suitable for MA,,

However, recent evidence suggests that over-exploitation has substantially reduced stock biomass throughout these regions. Deepwater marine protected areas (MPAs) are often established as a conservation and management tool, but there are few published studies on their efficacy. This study examined the effectiveness of a deepwater MPA in the Kita-Taikyu Bank (KB), based on the changes in relative abundance and size-frequency distributions for target species collected over seven years between a five-year period of year-round closure and subsequent seasonal closures. Etelis coruscans was the most abundant lutjanid in the KB, comprising 45.0% of the total number of individual deepwater snappers. The relative abundance of E. coruscans in the deepwater MPA was influenced by whether protection was year-round or seasonal; their abundance decreased significantly when the ban was lifted. Some distinct size modes of E. coruscans gradually grew larger during the year-round closure, but modes were indistinct after the change to seasonal closures. In addition, our results showed that the relative abundance of mature size classes had not fully recovered during the study period. In our tagging experiment for 151 deepwater snappers comprised of six species, two tagged Pristipomoides filamentosus were recaptured. These cases supplied some biological data regarding deepwater snappers: the periodicity of the growth zone formation and the low rate of cross-border movement of Pr. filementosus. Our study suggested that deepwater snappers are rapidly depleted by fishing and very slow to recover. It also provided evidence of the potential success of MPAs for deepwater snappers; longer-term year-round closure of deepwater MPAs may be the best solution for affording long-lived fishery species the protection necessary for them to achieve maturity.",5,2019,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.018,WOS:000466824300015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

We investigated EME variability by employing, for the first time, Organization Science. Eight Mediterranean MPAs were taken into account as case studies to explore the relationships between EME and MPA features, such as: 1) organizational size (i.e. the ratio between the number of full-time employees and the total MPA surface area), 2) management performance (i.e. the level of effort exerted to enhance and sustain the MPA management, including enforcement), 3) total surface area, and 4) MPA age. The log-response ratios of fish biomass and density in protected vs unprotected (control) areas were used as a proxy of EME. Management performance, organizational size and, to a lesser extent, MPA age were positively correlated with the log-response ratio of fish biomass, whereas total surface area did not display a significant role. None of the four features considered was significantly correlated with the log-response ratio of fish density.

The use of seasonal closures has been advanced for protecting aggregating fisheries for which managers have limited information on the location and timing of their reproductive events; however, few studies have examined the performance of these types of closures. This study asseses the perceptions of 150 fishers regarding the performance of seasonal closures in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Our results show that most fishers perceived that seasonal closures are effective fishery management measures. Across the six seasonal closures examined, fishers reported that these closures protected spawning aggregations and, to a lesser degree, increased fish abundance. These measures, however, did not always improve fishers' livelihoods nor result in their support for the seasonal closures. The loss of resource and market access during periods of high consumer demand and overlapping seasonal closures were the main causes of financial distress. Fishers indicated that the performance of the seasonal closures could be improved by increasing investments in monitoring, control, and surveillance capabilities, and adjusting their timing to accommodate economic and local ecological considerations. Fishers argued that revisions were necessary because some species spawned year-round or outside closure windows. Some fishers also called for replacing seasonal closures with alternative management measures (e.g., area-time closures, marine protected areas, gear restrictions), conducting additional scientific research, and improving fisher education. This work underscores that beliefs about conservation and livelihood outcomes are closely linked to the quality of management, the importance of conducting periodic assessments, and engaging fishers in decision-making to increase accountability, transparency, and support for management interventions.",1,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.03.025,WOS:000469154900003,field,,,fishery closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,small-scale,,fishery,mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,periodic no take zone

While some improvements in fisheries management have been made in these regions, a large fraction of coastal fisheries remain unmanaged, mismanaged, or use only crude input controls. These quasi-open-access conditions often lead to severe overfishing, depleted stocks, and compromised food security. A possible fishery management approach in these institution-poor settings is to implement fully protected marine protected areas (MPAs). Although the primary push for MPAs has been to solve the conservation problems that arise from mismanagement, MPAs can also benefit fisheries beyond their borders. The literature has not completely characterized how to design MPAs under diverse ecological and economic conditions when food security is the objective. We integrated four key biological and economic variables (i.e., fish population growth rate, fish mobility, fish price, and fishing cost) as well as an important aspect of reserve design (MPA size) into a general model and determined their combined influence on food security when MPAs are implemented in an open-access setting. We explicitly modeled open-access conditions that account for the behavioral response of fishers to the MPA; this approach is distinct from much of the literature that focuses on assumptions of scorched earth (i.e., severe over-fishing), optimized management, or an arbitrarily defined fishing mortality outside the MPA's boundaries. We found that the MPA size that optimizes catch depends strongly on economic variables. Large MPAs optimize catch for species heavily harvested for their high value and/or low harvesting cost, while small MPAs or no closure are best for species lightly harvested for their low value and high harvesting cost. Contrary to previous theoretical expectations, both high and low mobility species are expected to experience conservation benefits from protection, although, as shown previously, greater conservation benefits are expected for low mobility species. Food security benefits from MPAs can be obtained from species of any mobility. Results deliver both qualitative insights and quantitative guidance for designing MPAs for food security in open-access fisheries.",9,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-44406-w,WOS:000469318900002,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,local,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

The approach is the comparison of fishing households' economic situation in Chumphon Province (Thailand) at a given time based on their location in relation to a marine protected area: within or adjacent to Chumphon Archipelago Marine National Park vs. remote from it. We address three economic dimensions: the profitability of household activities, the income-distributional effects among households and the household vulnerability. This assessment requires the calculation of five indicators: the net income, the net profit margin, the Gini coefficient and the Herfindahl index, and Bene's vulnerability index. From a dataset made up of 123 fishing households surveyed twice a year, the main results show higher incomes and less economic vulnerability for households located within or adjacent to the MPA, and a more inegalitarian income distribution among households located remote from the MPA. So, the households located within or adjacent to the MPA have more security, can stay focused on the most profitable fishing activities and not have to diversify outside of the fishing sector. In an environment where commercial small-scale fishing was already highly developed, setting up an MPA could have the effect of sustaining an efficient, specialised professional set-up for fishing households in the area concerned. With respect to a policy to establish MPAs in keeping with the Durban recommendations, this study shows that a thorough analysis of profitability, income distribution and economic vulnerability should help to identify who the Winners and losers might be, which could improve the targeting of mitigation and compensation measures.

Growing concern over human impacts upon coastal waters and global strategic goals for healthier cities requires that coastal cities develop innovative ways to inspire and empower communities to embrace and cherish city seascapes. Coastal city communities have much to gain from a healthier relationship with the sea. This paper proposes a collaborative community-led marine park concept that celebrates a city's connection to the marine environment, enhances sustainable economic prosperity and enables communities to participate in activities that deepen understanding, value, care and enjoyment of the city seascape. A city marine park (CMP) is not a marine protected area because it does not have biodiversity and heritage protection or ecosystem governance as a primary goal and does not aim to restrict human activities. A CMP enables city communities to collaborate towards a shared vision of elevated status and value for the city seascape. A CMP considers socio-economic and geographical context, including land-sea connectivity, and is integrated within a coastal city's strategic urban planning. This paper highlights core themes of a CMP and the diverse and wide-ranging benefits from coordinated activities that better connect the city community with its seascape. If co-created by the coastal city community and civic leaders, a CMP will form an enduring spatial nexus for progress toward healthy cities addressing multiple interlinked global sustainable development goals.",12,2019,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.02.012,WOS:000463125700019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Success of MPAs depends upon sound scientific design and societal support. Studies that have assessed societal preferences for temperate MPAs have generally done it without considering the existence of discrete groups of opinion within society and have largely considered offshore and deep-sea areas. This study quantifies societal preferences and economic support for coastal MPAs in Wales (UK) and assesses the presence of distinct groups of preference for MPA management, through a latent class choice experiment approach. Results show a general support for the protection of the marine environment in the form of MPAs and that society is willing to bear the costs derived from conservation. Despite a general opposition toward MPAs where human activities are completely excluded, there is some indication that three classes of preferences within society can be established regarding the management of potentially sea-floor damaging activities. This type of approach allows for the distinction between those respondents with positive preferences for particular types of management from those who experience disutility. We conclude that insights from these types of analyses can be used by policy-makers to identify those MPA designs and management combinations most likely to be supported by particular sectors of society.",1,2019,10.7717/peerj.6672,WOS:000465195300002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,

High-profile dialogue and policy decisions on the future of the ocean are informed largely by economic and ecological research. Key insights from the social sciences raise concerns for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and social justice, but these have yet to gain traction with investors and the policy discourse on transforming ocean governance. The largest group of ocean-users - women and men who service, fish and trade from small-scale fisheries (SSF) - argue that they have been marginalized from the dialogue between international environmental and economic actors that is determining strategies for the future of the ocean. Blue Economy or Blue Growth initiatives see the ocean as the new economic frontier and imply an alignment with social objectives and SSF concerns. Deeper analysis reveals fundamental differences in ideologies, priorities and approaches. We argue that SSF are being subtly and overtly squeezed for geographic, political and economic space by larger scale economic and environmental conservation interests, jeopardizing the substantial benefits SSF provide through the livelihoods of millions of women and men, for the food security of around four billion consumers globally, and in the developing world, as a key source of micro-nutrients and protein for over a billion low-income consumers.

Many initiatives, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), are frequently opposed by fishermen. This research reviewed management measures and interviewed 313 fishermen by purposive stratification and snowball sampling. Data were analyzed by fishery, age, and vessel size to address the attitudes and perceptions of fishermen toward twelve fisheries management measures. Descriptive statistics, as well as chi-squared tests and independent t-tests, were used for basic analysis and differences comparison between groups. The results showed that illegal fishing vessels from China (71%), overfishing (69.5%), and ghost fishing (64%) are considered as major threats to Taiwan marine resources. The measures from voyage data recorders, larval anchovy, precious coral, and shark management result in higher satisfaction because of strict monitoring. The satisfaction measures for three net-type measures, i.e., trawler area closure, torch-light limitation, and gillnet limitation, were low. Line-type and small-scale vessel fishermen are more concerned with small mesh size and ghost fishing. Net-type, large-scale vessels and young fishermen were concerned about climate change and inappropriate measures. In conclusion, the priorities are to (1) establish a comprehensive scientific research framework; (2) strengthen enforcement to ensure resources rebuilding, especially for large-scale net fisheries; (3) promote public awareness and build communication between stakeholders to obtain support; and (4) communicate among policymakers and fishermen to increase mutual understanding.",8,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.015,WOS:000462801300001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

The Llevant de Mallorca-Cala Rajada MPA (Spain, Western Mediterranean) was created in 2007 under the patronage of the artisanal fishermen association of Cala Rajada. This study uses onboard observer data of the existing artisanal fisheries practices (metiers), their seasonality and spatial distribution of effort in the area before (2003-2007) and after (2008-2012) MPA designation, to illustrate how fishing restrictions and regulations have changed the structure and dynamics of local fishery me tiers, with inshore fishing effort partially reallocated to offshore fishing grounds farther from port. Unforeseen effects of MPA restrictions concerned coastal artisanal metiers impinging on the smaller boats and the oldest and most knowledgeable fishers and the expansion of me tiers that use newer boats and manned by younger, less experienced fishermen.

The appropriateness of the IA methodology currently in use is tested on the example of a small scale fishery in a protected area in the German coast in the Baltic Sea (Fehmam island). The impact of the fisheries management measures is first assessed using the available data and the results are then checked with the local fishermen and a producer organization representative using a focus group. Given the discrepancies identified in the focus group, additional methodologies are explored. By performing a literature review and a workshop with scientists, fishermen representatives, environmental organizations and managers, inputs from political science (the wicked problem approach) and philosophy of science (the NUSAP matrix) are applied to cope with the context of high uncertainty driven by poor ecological, economic and social data. This case study brings the opportunity to identify challenges as the assessment of biodiversity and potentially conflictive differences in national policy objectives under different EU policies (including the Common Fisheries Policy), in a way that goes beyond the contribution of other commonly used management tools as impact assessment and spatial planning.

However, the impact of MPAs may vary according to the type of fisheries. In Senegal, the sardinella fishery accounts for 70% of total catches. This fishery is of crucial importance for national food security and employment. Given this importance, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of MPAs, often being considered as a tool for fisheries management. An analytical, dynamic and spatial bio-economic model of sardinella fishery, considering fish and fisher migration, has been developed and scenarios over forty years have been analyzed. The results show that the fishery is economically overexploited and that Senegal could lose about 11.6 billion CFA over forty years of exploitation, i.e. 290 million CFA per year. To achieve an optimal level of exploitation, it would be necessary to halve the current fishing capacity. Implementing MPAs for 10, 20 and 30% of the Senegalese exclusive economic zone lead to slight increases in biomass (1%) and rent (5-11%). In addition, spatio-temporal closures can lead to increased exploitation in unclosed areas, due to the absence of enforcement. Achieving target 11 of the Aichi Convention, i.e., 10% of coastal and marine areas protected per country, will have a reserve effect on the resource but also only lead to weak improvements in economic indicators for the Senegalese fishery. Finally, because the sardinella resource is shared among many countries of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC), a sub-regional cooperation is necessary for a sustainable management.",2,2019,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.12.020,WOS:000459518700024,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,incomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer an important management tool for enhancing ecosystem structure and function. This study investigated whether a non-lethal indicator of trophic position (TP) could be used to evaluate fishery health in southern California MPAs. We hypothesized that a common predator, kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), would occupy a higher TP and smaller niche space inside MPAs than at fished reference sites, and that these patterns would be supported by trends in abundance and gut contents. Stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) were used to estimate the TP and niche space of kelp bass (N = 125) collected inside and outside of four MPAs during summer 2016-2017. Although all MPA sites supported a significantly higher biomass of kelp bass than reference sites, there was no consistent pattern in TP and niche space inside versus outside of MPAs. Gut contents showed that exploitation of ephemeral pelagic foods may reduce localized effects of MPAs on prey availability for this species. Our findings suggest that MPAs will not have consistent impacts on food web dynamics for higher level generalist predators and that ecosystem-level responses to protection may vary across locations within a bioregion.

There are at least four general objectives for marine reserve design: (1) maximizing conservation, (2) minimizing total reserve area, (3) maximizing reserve compactness, and (4) minimizing socioeconomic opportunity cost (e.g., fisheries revenue). A spatial optimization model was developed to solve for reserve placements under those four objectives, while evaluating the bioeconomic tradeoffs and potential gaps of a subset of bottomfish restricted fishing areas (BRFAs) for the Hawaiian bottomfish fishery. Optimized reserve placements with minimal opportunity costs had little overlap (< 9%) with the placements of the BRFAs, opportunity cost values 50-83% less than that of the BRFAs with 40-54% higher potential conservation value. When reserve placements were optimized to provide a maximal opportunity cost, solutions had up to 49% overlap with the BRFAs, highlighting a potential drawback of the BRFA system with respect to socioeconomic impacts. When opportunity cost was instead calculated as total area, the optimized placements also had considerable overlap (up to 42%) with the BRFAs, highlighting the importance of socioeconomic data to the reserve design process. The solutions that provided maximal reserve compactness may be the most pragmatic for a reserve design team with specific area and/or conservation targets, as these solutions produced compact reserve placements that best matched those targets at a minimal opportunity cost. This analysis emphasized the use of spatial optimization models to not only guide the reserve design process, but to highlight tradeoffs of conflicting fisheries objectives in reserve design.",4,2019,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.11.016,WOS:000458708000018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,design,

In addition, the analysis of catches occurring during local fishing competitions organized off the MPA limits suggested a harvesting capacity for each angler varying between 0.7 and 1.1 kg/angler per day, depending on the used gear (handlining, trolling, spear-guns). Finally, 36% of the anglers claimed to hook often the hard bottom seabed, often losing nylon lines. Consequently, the Management Body of the Portofino MPA has been advised to suspend recreational fishing activities in the most busy areas for a period of two years, calling for a complete removal of the lost fishing gears.",4,2019,10.12681/mms.18043,WOS:000468489800008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not impacts,

The lack of proper engagement with resource users raises questions about transparency and legitimacy of marine conservation initiatives, hampering their successful implementation. The proposed mapping approach offers a simple way to incorporate in the planning process what small-scale fishers consider to be important to conserve, what they value in their fishing livelihoods, and their perception about the likely impact that multiple uses of the area may cause. Conducted in a small group setting, the exploratory mapping approach is casual and conversational, using paper maps and markers to capture information and stories as they are told.

This is particularly true for small-scale fisheries (SSFs) when fishermen are engaged in management and collaborate with MPA managers and scientists. Small-scale fisheries are widespread along Mediterranean coasts, and in Albania, they have developed remarkably since the 1990s. In 2010, the area of Karaburun and Sazani was declared as the first MPA in Albania. Two fishing communities located in different harbors operate locally, fishing outside the MPA and in its buffer zone. One fishing community is more willing to collaborate with scientists and managers, whereas the other is more reluctant to collaborate. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare catch composition, total catches, and CPUE between the two fishing fleets under the general hypothesis that fishermen engagement and a more collaborative attitude can lead to larger catches. Results showed that on average, fishermen from the more collaborative fishing community usually deployed shorter nets within the MPA but obtained higher total catches and CPUEs than fishermen from the less-collaborative community. These findings-despite being inconclusive due to the limited sample size, reduced sampling period, and correlative approach-highlight the potential benefits delivered by the adoption of a collaborative approach and specifically provide a baseline for building sound management plans for SSFs in Albania in the future.",0,2018,10.1002/mcf2.10036,WOS:000454411800001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no control,

Here, we compare continental- and decadal-scale trends in fisheries catches with underwater reef monitoring data for 533 sites around Australia, and find matching evidence of rapid fish-stock declines. Regardless of a high global ranking for fisheries sustainability, catches from Australian wild fisheries decreased by 31% over the past decade. The biomass of large fishes observed on underwater transects decreased significantly over the same period on fished reefs (36% decline) and in marine park zones that allow limited fishing (18% decline), but with a negligible overall change in no-fishing marine reserves. Populations of exploited fishes generally rose within marine reserves and declined outside the reserves, whereas unexploited species showed little difference in population trends within or outside reserves. Although changing climate and more precautionary fisheries management contribute to declining fish catches, fisheries-independent transect data suggest that excessive fishing also plays a major role. The large number of fishery stocks that remain unmanaged or have poor data, coupled with continuing declines in the stock biomass of managed fish species, indicate that Aichi Target 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (i.e. 'by 2020, all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably') will not be achieved in Australia, or elsewhere.

Closures extended into 2016 and generated an economic shock for coastal fishing communities.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 community members from two communities impacted by the event - Crescent City, California and Long Beach, Washington. Interviewees included those involved in the fishing, hospitality, and retail industries, local government officials, recreational harvesters, and others. Interviews probed aspects of resilience in economic, social, institutional, and physical domains, based on the contention that community resilience will influence the communities' ability to withstand HAB events. Dimensions of vulnerability were also explored, encompassing sensitivity of the communities to HAB events and their adaptive capacity. Common themes that emerged from the interview responses indicate that economic hardships extended beyond fishing-related operations and permeated through other sectors, particularly the hospitality industry. Significant barriers to accessing financial and employment assistance during extended fisheries closures were identified, particularly for fishers. Long-held traditions surrounding crab and shellfish harvest and consumption were disrupted, threatening the cultural identities of the affected communities. Community members expressed a desire for clearer, more thorough, and more rapid dissemination of information regarding the management of fisheries closures and the health risks associated with HAB toxins. The likelihood of intensifying HABs under climate change heightens the need for actions to increase the resilience of fishing communities to the economic and sociocultural impacts caused by HAB-related fisheries closures.",22,2018,10.1016/j.hal.2018.09.002,WOS:000453621000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems. In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for half a million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice. Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge. Based on benthic sampling in 2010-2012, a model of eider foraging energetics and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997-2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding. In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited or too far from landfast ice to provide regular hunting access. In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable, but often within a consistent geographic range. Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters' needs. These results can inform spatial planning of industrial activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in less developed locations.

'Customary MPAs' already exist in Fiji's coastal environments, taking the form of tabu areas and 'Locally Managed Marine Areas' (LMMAs). Both of these are important mechanisms that any new statutory framework should incorporate and strengthen. In 2010, the draft Inshore Fisheries Decree (draft Inshore Decree) was prepared.

The results suggest that most recreational fishers who fish in established marine parks are supportive of the no-take marine reserves within them. On average, 63.3% of fishers support no-take marine reserves in their marine park, and 17.8% are opposed. Further, recreational fishers' support for no-take marine reserves increases markedly with reserve age. This research indicates that most recreational fishers are supportive of no-take marine reserves within marine parks and that support increases over time.",3,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.06.021,WOS:000447104100007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recreational,,,support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,

Efforts have been made to understand how fishers' attitudes, understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which humans arrive at their views about the world the - social group. In multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which group type is more associated with particular environmental and governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172), village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative research on research users' perceptions. This has consequences for policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group belonging.",2,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.06.017,WOS:000447104100013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

This SAC harbours a high diversity of invertebrate communities, and it is located in a very touristy area of the littoral of Malaga and within the limits of one of the most productive shellfish fishing areas of the NW Alboran Sea. Here, the artisanal fishery targeting molluscs is a locally important activity because some species (e.g. Chamelea gallina, Callista chione, Donax trunculus) are highly demanded by locals and touristsand therefore reaching high commercial value. More than 200 molluscan species inhabit the soft bottoms of the SAC Calahonda, from which eight species collected in this study have economic value. The bivalve C. gallina was the most abundant and frequent commercial species, mainly at shallow fine and medium sand bottoms, followed by C. chione at coarse sand bottoms. Some species displayed higher abundance values of large or small size individuals at different depths, and most of them showed maximum abundances in spring and summer. Many invertebrate species associated with these soft bottoms are potentially very sensitive to dredging activities, especially echinoderms, decapods and cnidarians. Further research regarding the potential impact of fisheries on these assemblages would be desirable, especially considering the high biodiversity existing within this SAC and the increase of tourists in the last years.",0,2018,10.1007/s41208-018-0070-5,WOS:000447785900012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

The prominent model by which MPAs operate is through a comanagement approach, a shift from traditional top-down management. This paradigm shift must be reviewed continuously to evaluate its social and ecological impacts, thereby allowing adaptive management. We evaluated the perceived impacts of the Cogtong Bay Mangrove Rehabilitation Project (CBMRP; Philippines) by using 12 perception indicators categorized into 3 comanagement impact criteria (equity, efficiency, and sustainability). We also collected 16 contextual attributes of each respondent to determine the correlates of perceived impacts. Our results showed that there were significant improvements in all indicators under the efficiency criterion but mixed impacts in the equity and sustainability criteria. Access to resource and household income (equity) and fisheries abundance (sustainability) were perceived to have decreased during the last 15 years and were not expected to improve in the future. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the asymmetries of the perceived impacts of the CBMRP were principally caused by disparities in perceptions by gender and by location (Candijay and Mabini). This highlighted the importance of cross-scale institutional linkages between Cogtong Bay municipalities to systematically address baywide management issues. Our results further demonstrated the necessity of integrating gender issues into the evaluation of MPA impacts to ensure a robust evaluation.

The optimization of trade-offs between biodiversity benefits and socioeconomic values increases success of protected areas and minimizes enforcement costs in the long run, but it is often neglected in marine spatial planning (MSP). Although the acquisition of spatially explicit socioeconomic data is perceived as a costly or secondary step in MSP, it is critical to account for lost opportunities by people whose activities will be restricted, especially fishers. We developed an easily reproduced habitat-based approach to estimate the spatial distribution of opportunity cost to fishers in data-poor regions. We assumed the most accessible areas have higher economic and conservation values than less accessible areas and their designation as no-take zones represents a loss of fishing opportunities. We estimated potential distribution of fishing resources from bathymetric ranges and benthic habitat distribution and the relative importance of the different resources for each port of total catches, revenues, and stakeholder perception. In our model, we combined different cost layers to produce a comprehensive cost layer so that we could evaluate of trade-offs. Our approach directly supports conservation planning, can be applied generally, and is expected to facilitate stakeholder input and community acceptance of conservation. Una Estrategia basada en el Habitat para Predecir los Impactos de las areas Marinas Protegidas sobre los Pescadores Aunque las areas marinas protegidas (AMPs) pueden contribuir simultaneamente a la conservacion de la biodiversidad y al manejo de las pesquerias, la red global esta sesgada hacia tipos particulares de ecosistemas porque las AMPs se han establecido primordialmente de manera ad hoc. La optimizacion de las compensaciones entre los beneficios de la biodiversidad y los valores socio-economicos incrementa el exito de las areas protegidas y minimiza los costos de ejecucion a la larga, pero frecuentemente se ignora durante la planeacion espacial marina (MSP, en ingles). Aunque la obtencion de datos socio-economicos espacialmente explicitos se percibe como costosa o como un paso secundario en la MSP, es critico considerar las oportunidades perdidas por las personas cuyas actividades seran restringidas, especialmente las pesquerias. Desarrollamos una estrategia de facil reproduccion con base en el habitat para estimar la distribucion espacial del costo de oportunidad para los pescadores en regiones pobres en datos. Asumimos que las areas mas accesibles tienen valores economicos y de conservacion mas altos que las areas menos accesibles y su designacion como zonas de extraccion nula representa una perdida de oportunidades de pesca. Estimamos la distribucion potencial de los recursos pesqueros a partir de rangos batimetricos y la distribucion de habitats benticos, y la importancia relativa de los diferentes recursos para cada puerto de capturas totales, ingresos y percepcion de los accionistas. En nuestro modelo combinamos diferentes niveles de costo para producir un nivel comprensivo de costo para asi poder evaluar las compensaciones. Nuestra estrategia respalda directamente a la planeacion de la conservacion, puede aplicarse de manera general, y se espera que facilite la contribucion de los accionistas y la aceptacion de la conservacion por parte de la comunidad.

Therefore, the results obtained shows that in spite of decentralisation of the existing rules, these set out the criteria that must be observed for the strengthening and adequate development of MPA, complying with the principles of legality and legitimacy, so it can become a legal and legitimate environmental policy. Thus, a review was made of those principles from the perspective of Canavieiras Extractive Reserve for being the latest and despite having achieved major economic interests in the area, it has fulfilled the requirements regarding the legality and legitimacy, although it has been going through several questions about the regard of your creation.

The ecosystem-based planning and management approach has developed over the past decades with the goal of reducing this threat by defining planning and management of uses in a way that mitigates negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. For oceans and coasts, marine spatial planning (MSP) can further aid the implementation of ecosystem based management, a widely accepted tenet of planning for the marine environment. It can do so by allocating different uses of space in a way that reduces conflicts for the benefit of the environment. Here, we propose an approach to MSP that incorporates principles of reconciliation ecology for the planning of marine (nearshore) enclosures. The approach supports conservation within and around anthropogenic elements outside of marine protected areas. Since human activity typically involves some damage to natural ecosystem, this research contributes by proposing a way to incorporate ecosystem modeling for MSP that includes human activity. Examining areas of human activity under different management scenarios allows identification of possible trends in human-natural ecosystem interactions. Using such an approach increases marine conservation opportunities, and directs educated and cautious MSP in ways that allow implementation of an ecosystem-based approach.",3,2018,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.026,WOS:000444614500063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

It is well established that habitat restoration results in higher finfish biomass and diversity where oyster reefs replace bare substrata. Therefore, restoring oyster reefs with a view to also improving fish stocks is often a key goal of oyster restoration. However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs. Integrating these ecological and coastal management concepts into oyster reef restoration will enhance outcomes for fishes and increase stakeholder engagement and cost-effectiveness.",14,2018,10.1111/faf.12301,WOS:000443114900013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

A multi-method study of citizen and practitioner perspectives on protection and restoration suggests that capacity to manage under these conditions can be improved through strengthening an approach that has already become central in restoration practice: multiple-benefit planning. In this research, we examine and compare planning approaches used to develop marine protected areas (MPA) and estuary restoration (ER) projects in Puget Sound. Surveying non-tribal public attitudes toward these projects, we found limited knowledge concerning existing MPAs but support for wider use of such protections. We find that initiatives pursuing conservation, protection, restoration and resilience can gain advantage from (a) broadly inclusive and collaborative planning; (b) recognition of tribal treaty rights, management authorities, and leadership; (c) careful consideration and mitigation of project impacts on affected people (e.g. especially tribal and non-tribal fisheries for MPAs; farm interests and landowners for restoration projects). We note that no-take MPA designation has stalled, while ER efforts are overcoming sharp objections and controversies by crafting projects to deliver multiple social-ecological benefits: improved flood control and drainage, salmon recovery, recreational enjoyment, and resilience to climate change. Comparable strategies have not yet evolved in designation of no-take MPAs in Puget Sound. We offer conclusions and recommendations for accelerating conservation and resilience initiatives to keep pace with a changing environment. A key human dimensions research-based recommendation is that increasing environmental pressures intensify the need to strengthen collaborative and sustained planning and implementation processes.",2,2018,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.05.020,WOS:000444793600008,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,based on results from previous study (Hard et al. 2012)

These closures can have serious consequences for fishers and fishing communities, and have necessitated the release of millions of dollars of federal disaster aid. The 2017 ocean Chinook troll fishery (the major salmon ocean fishery) is closed between southern Oregon and northern California to protect the Klamath River fall Chinook, which is forecast to return in low numbers. A model of vessel fishing choices was used in combination with an established input-output model to estimate the potential economic impact of this closure on fishers and fishing communities. The analysis predicts that this closure of the ocean fishery will result in a loss of $5.8-$8.9 million in income, $12.8-$19.6 million in sales, and 200-330 jobs. These estimates are only a partial estimate of the economic impacts of the 2017 salmon regulations, as they do not fully account for the effects of the limited season outside of the closed ocean area or the effects on other salmon fisheries (e.g. the gillnet and recreational fisheries). The impacts are not distributed evenly in space, with the largest relative losses occurring in the Coos Bay, Brookings, and Eureka regions. This information may be useful as policymakers consider mitigating economic losses in the fishery and associated communities. Early estimates of economic impacts of fishery closures may also enable quicker determination of the need and extent of disaster assistance and a more timely response.",5,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.005,WOS:000442190400017,model,,,ABMT,closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

MPA designation, however, continues to be used for perceived conservation and socioeconomic benefits for adjacent communities. Local beliefs regarding ecological and socio-economic outcomes often influence the public support for MPAs and ultimately their effectiveness. This paper focuses on understanding local residents' beliefs regarding a potential South Coast National Marine Conservation Area (NMCA) in Newfoundland and Labrador and how those beliefs influence resident support for the NMCA. Data were collected from 180 Burgeo residents through a household survey. While 33% supported the designation of a South Coast NMCA, 43% opposed it and 26% were unsure. A principal component analysis (PCA) extracted five belief constructs. A regression model was used to examine relationships between these constructs and support for a South Coast NMCA. The results indicate that perceived economic development and marine conservation were the best predictors of support for NMCA establishment. Qualitative data analysis supported these findings and was used to better understand these relationships, with a minority of respondents seeing economic opportunities and protection and conservation as causes for support of the proposal. Qualitative responses also revealed strong concerns about the loss of traditional and current means of livelihood. If a South Coast NMCA is to be considered feasible it will require greater support and a shift in resident beliefs. This will require effective stakeholder engagement and increased educational and information campaigns.",5,2018,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.12.021,WOS:000440119600002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,

Marine protected areas, specifically no-take areas (NTAs) where all extractive uses are prohibited, are now widely-used to promote sustainable fisheries and protect marine biodiversity. However, no take areas have had mixed success, and the governance structures that determine success are not well understood. The institutional, social, economic, and political context of the no-take areas and the response of resource users to their establishment are rarely considered in establishing marine reserves. In developing countries with high levels of poverty and low enforcement capacity, harvest practices rarely adhere to formal laws and regulations. As a consequence, many no-take areas have become paper parks that fail to provide ecological and social benefits. In this paper, we use the Coupled-Infrastructure System (CIS) framework to explore the problem of paper parks by assessing stakeholder perceptions, preferences, and levels of knowledge on NTAs within a regional system of three no-take areas in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Using structured interviews, we found differences in perceptions about the use of NTAs for conservation of biodiversity and management of fisheries, misconceptions about the location of current NTAs, and problems of non-compliance behavior. We identify a weak relationship between the perception of NTAs by the resource users and the way in which current NTA tools operate in Mexico. Consequently, anticipated success based on the mere presence of the NTA and its regulations is hindered by how the resource users interact with the resource itself, but more importantly by what leads up to this hindrance. A focus on this weakness in the CIS system is critical to achieving NTA objectives.",6,2018,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.01.024,WOS:000440119600017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

The present study evaluated the use of lobster traps, relative to control areas, in two types of MPAs that protect coral reef habitat and prohibit lobster trap fishing: MPAs with marked boundaries vs MPAs with unmarked boundaries. The number of traps, trap owners, and trap location coordinates were recorded in replicate MPAs before and after an educational outreach effort to promote better recognition of trap fishing regulations in MPAs. The mean density of traps (number of traps km(-2)) was greatest in unmarked MPAs during both pre- [40.5 (SE 7.1) traps] and posteducation [23.9 (SE 4.5) traps] surveys; however, the reduction in trap density was not significant.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been proposed as a way to protect some of these ES, but decisions regarding what gets protection and what gets consumed can be a source of conflicts. One such example is the Fernando de Noronha MPA (Brazil), where there is a conflict between shark-directed tourism and fishers who would like to access the no-take part of the MPA during part of the year. A contingent valuation method (Willingness to Pay) was used to ascertain if tourists would accept compensating fishers for not disturbing the sharks during a specific period of the year, by adding a symbolic increase in the taxes they already pay to either visit the island or to visit the no take part of the MPA. Tourists were open to this alternative (67-71%), regardless of the fee being paid. However, there was a slight tendency to reject the fee when the tourists saw sharks during their stay, suggesting that a closer contact with these animals triggered a less sympathetic attitude towards fishers, probably because they start seeing fishers as wrongdoers, even if this is the worst choice for conservation. Although such a hypothetical payment was easily accepted by the majority of the tourists and could represent an affordable solution to conflicts, convincing those who reject such social compensation, especially if based on an irrational choice, would be an important step for sharks and for the MPA as a whole.",8,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.016,WOS:000434752900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,willingness to pay,

To minimize the future risk of ineffective management efforts, it has previously been argued that management should focus on a multi-island conservation target (regional scale), rather than on individual lagoons (local scale). However, it is unclear how a MPA network designed to meet objectives at a regional scale would impact on the management of resources at the local scale. In particular, it is necessary to understand if a regional plan might incidentally maintain conservation objectives at the local scale, without disproportionately affecting, or relying on particular islands. This study used the population of the giant clam (Tridacna maxima) in a fishery context to explore the distributions of conservation features and socio-economic costs for regional networks (computed within a set of islands), compared to individual islands. Designing a MPA network at regional scale led to unbalanced representation of conservation features among atolls and incidentally missed the targeted level of protection for conservation features at local scale. Moreover, the regional network generated inequitable costs for fishermen between islands, which is likely to lead to poor perceived equity. This study suggests that perceived equity and the representation of local conservation objectives will be major factors to consider, if the French Polynesian authorities follow the path of implementing MPAs in each atoll for a regional-scale resource management plan.",2,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.024,WOS:000434752900004,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,optimal design of an MPA network

Their respective targets should drive policy decisions for Scottish fisheries, in keeping with the universal intent of the new goals. This paper explores the relevance of SDG 14 to the Scottish fishing industry, noting that there are a number of linkages with other goals and targets that should be considered within management frameworks. Scottish fishing has a long history, but the size of the inshore fleet has seen decline in recent decades, particularly of small-scale fishers in rural communities. Available literature was reviewed and a survey of active Scottish fishers conducted to explore the current availability and equality of distribution of benefits from ecosystem services to Scottish fisheries, and the factors that affect them. The findings suggest that benefits may not currently be equally distributed across Scottish fisheries; this is largely sector dependent and driven by market forces, but also relates to gaps in current management and monitoring systems. Furthermore, the potential benefits to fisheries of marine protected areas (MPAs) established for conservation purposes are not adequately assessed as part of their design, which may result in less support from fisheries stakeholders and reduce the benefit to ecosystem services. It concludes with some recommendations for consideration by decision makers to improve how fishing businesses and communities could benefit more from ecosystem services whilst operating within environmental limits.",8,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.06.009,WOS:000434752900031,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mostly on ecosystem services and not MPAs

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and networks of MPAs are being implemented globally as a spatial management tool for achieving conservation objectives. There has been considerable progress in reaching the prescribed 10% protected area target for 2020, outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 11 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14. 2. The application of MPA network design principles (e. g. Representative, ecological connectivity), which underpin ecological coherence, is still lacking or insufficient in many regions. Poor ecological coherence hinders the ecological performance of MPA networks, leading to dysfunction in the flow of ecosystem services and reduced ecosystem benefits, with potentially negative consequences for human well-being. 3. This paper presents four pivotal focus points for future progress that can bridge the gap between ecological and social systems. The aim is to shift the discourse of ` ecological coherence' further into the social sphere, and hence support the alignment of the process of designating ecologically coherent MPA networks with the ` triple bottom line' of economic development, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion, as described in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to achieve social-ecological coherence in MPA network design.",11,2018,10.1002/aqc.2885,WOS:000435930100023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

It is important to assess whether they are in fact delivering socioeconomic benefits to the surrounding communities beyond increasing fish biomass. The Socio-Economic Assessment Tool (SEAT) was developed to measure these benefits. While there are existing tools, most of them are difficult to accomplish and require extensive data gathering, thus are not utilized enough by MPA managers in the country. SEAT is designed to complement the MPA Effectiveness Assessment Tool (MEAT), the primary framework being used to assess MPA governance effectiveness in the Philippines. The tool builds on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Framework of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on whether MPAs increase financial, human and social capital of MPA management bodies and the surrounding communities. SEAT was pilot-tested in several MPAs across the country, and the results were used to develop incentive schemes, i.e. recognition awards, as a sustainability mechanism for MPA management. On an individual level, the results can provide guidelines on how MPAs can better be designed, managed or even expanded to increase solo-economic outcomes. At the national level, the SEAT results can further enrich the existing MPA database being maintained by the MPA Support Network of the Philippines, which will allow for a more comprehensive assessment on the effectiveness of MPA5 in improving human wellbeing.",6,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.02.026,WOS:000430765100013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Fortunately, other marine spatial tools, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), have already addressed questions similar to those now central to successful TURF design. We propose that well-established lessons from MPA design should provide a strong basis for the development of design criteria for TURFs. In this paper, we review the MPA literature to inform the design of TURFs based on the similarities and differences of these 2 marine spatial management tools. We found that TURF design can obtain important lessons from MPA theory, for example on how to diminish the effects of environmental and human disturbance.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly integrated into fishery management for coastal systems. Size and spacing rules (SSRs) have been proposed as simple MPA design guidelines, especially in regions where population connectivity data are limited. 2. We assessed whether SSRs allow managers to design effective MPA networks under spatiotemporally varying dispersal patterns using a spatially realistic population model parameterized for a commercially-exploited fish species on the Great Barrier Reef. 3. SSRs are used to design MPA networks, and population simulations are used to measure the mean and variance of the resulting population size and fishery catch. 4. We show that SSR performance is contingent on the extent of the MPA network, and whether species' connectivity data can be used to target areas for protection. For example, in the absence of connectivity data, a many small MPAs rule provides the least variable management outcome. 5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the performance and usefulness of size and spacing rules (SSRs) as guidelines for marine protected areas (MPAs) depend on the level of knowledge about larval dispersal, as well as the level of current exploitation in the fishery. These context-dependent results offer particularly relevant guidance to future MPA design projects in regions with limited connectivity data.",6,2018,10.1111/1365-2664.13043,WOS:000430059500002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,design,

Recently, many citizen science programs have endeavored to help provide these much-needed data. Implementation of MPAs under the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative in Southern California was followed by a monitoring program to establish a comprehensive baseline of the ecological conditions of several marine ecosystems at the time of MPA implementation. This baseline monitoring consortium involved several citizen science monitoring programs alongside more traditional academic monitoring programs, creating an opportunity to evaluate the potential for citizen scientists to become more involved in future long-term monitoring efforts. We investigated different citizen science models, their program goals, and contributions to MPA baseline monitoring, including their respective monitoring protocols and data quality assurance measures, in the context of the goals of the MLPA baseline monitoring program. We focused on three very different case studies: (i) commercial fishermen and other volunteers collaborating with researchers to study the California spiny lobster, (ii) volunteer divers monitoring rocky reefs with the Reef Check California (RCCA) program and (iii) middle and high school students monitoring the inter-tidal life of rocky shore and sandy beach ecosystems with the National Marine Sanctuaries' Long-term Monitoring Program and Experiential Training for Students (LiMPETS) program. We elucidate capacities and potential of citizen science approaches for MPA baseline monitoring and for building capacity towards sustainable long-term monitoring of MPAs.

This paper describes the process involved, the chosen indicators and the selected results of the evaluation of management effectiveness of three MPAs in the Calamianes Islands, Palawan Province, Philippines. The evaluation was a participatory process that involved several institutions: academe, an externally-funded project, local governments, national government agencies and research organizations. Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys. We illustrate that a multidisciplinary approach and engagement of key stakeholders provides a comprehensive assessment and consensus for measuring the success of MPAs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Marine protected areas are increasingly proposed for use by researchers and managers, in combination with or separate from traditional fishery management techniques (e.g., harvest quotas, size quotas, etc.), to improve this situation. Marine reserves, also known as no-take zones, are the strictest of these protected areas. We review published and government documents that explore the costs and benefits of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve - a recently-created marine reserve that is part of the much larger Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary - to three major groups of stakeholders: commercial users, recreational users, and agency personnel. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty in all cases, identifying and quantifying economic costs is more straightforward than quantifying benefits, in part because they are more well-known and more short-term in nature. The costs of creating and managing this reserve are minor on the scale of the economy of Monroe Country, Florida, but benefits, although real, are unlikely to impact stakeholders in the short-term and are thus tenuous. In some cases, direct economic incentives for those few individuals suffering direct costs (i.e., commercial interests) are recommendable. In the absence of such, and given the disparate nature of costs and benefits associated with the creation of marine reserves, adaptive and interactive management approaches, combined with traditional fishery management techniques, are recommended to achieve policy and management goals. This includes ongoing public education, outreach, and stakeholder analysis over time (coupled with strict law enforcement within reserves) if the ultimate goal of improving the sustainability of habitat and fisheries in surrounding waters is to be achieved.",13,2005,,WOS:000232940000010,field,BA,2002,MPA,Florida Keys,5,medium,1997,PPA,NA,35,51,medium,NA,state,USA,subtropical,North America,North West Atlantic,mix,,,,,,,,,recreational,assets,economic,income,negative,yes,% revenue change,p393,NA,,,,,,,12,,,,,,12,-0.060480747,,,,24,regulation of the park changed multiple times since,,

This article provides a comparative study of the management regimes of the Gulf of Castellammare Fishery Reserve and the Egadi Islands Marine Reserve in Sicily, Italy. What managers in these two reserves have neglected to include in management is a social science evaluation scheme to ensure the development of more effective overall management. This is a significant problem in both Italy and the rest of the Mediterranean, where few sociocultural and economic studies have been conducted.

Periodically harvested closures (PHCs) are one of the most common forms of fisheries management in Melanesia, demonstrating multiple objectives, including sustaining fish stocks and increasing catch efficiency to support small-scale fisheries. No studies have comprehensively assessed their ability to provide short-term fisheries benefits across the entire harvest regime. 2. We present a novel analytical framework to guide a meta-analysis and assist future research in conceptualizing and assessing the potential of PHCs to deliver benefits for multiple fisheries-related objectives. 3. Ten PHCs met our selection criteria and on average, they provided a 48% greater abundance and 92% greater biomass of targeted fishes compared with areas open to fishing prior to being harvested. 4. This translated into tangible harvest benefits, with fishers removing 21% of the abundance and 49% of the biomass within PHCs, resulting in few post-harvest protection benefits. 5. When PHCs are larger, closed for longer periods or well enforced, short-term fisheries benefits are improved. However, an increased availability of fish within PHCs leads to greater removal during harvests. 6. Synthesis and applications. Periodically harvested closures (PHCs) can provide short-term fisheries benefits. Use of the analytical framework presented here will assist in determining long-term fisheries and conservation benefits. We recommend PHCs be closed to fishing for as long as possible, be as large as possible, that compliance be encouraged via community engagement and enforcement, and strict deadlines/goals for harvesting set to prevent overfishing.",10,2018,10.1111/1365-2664.13047,WOS:000430059500007,metaanalysis,CI,2017,fishery closure,mix,mix,,mix,mix,,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,,fishery,food security,global,catch,positive,yes,% increased removal of biomass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,periodic fishery closure ,,

However, evaluations across multiple outcomes are lacking. We used a systematic approach to code several social and ecological outcomes of 12 LMPAs. We found evidence of three types of trade-offs: trade-offs between different ecological resources (supply trade-offs); trade-offs between ecological resource conditions and the well-being of resource users (supply-demand trade-offs); and trade-offs between the well-being outcomes of different resource users (demand trade-offs). We also found several divergent outcomes that were attributed to influences beyond the scope of the LMPA. We suggest that despite their size, trade-offs can develop in LMPAs and should be considered in planning and design.

Yet, to date, no study has explored its effects on highly-migratory pelagic species, such as tuna. To this end, the impact of the GMR on the behavior and productivity of tuna fisheries in this region is analyzed. After considering other potential factors, which occurred approximately over the same period (i.e. increase of fleet size, changes in fishing technology, and climatic events, among others), it was found that the creation of the GMR increased fishing productivity in both the Galapagos Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the GMR, as well as inside the marine reserve. However, the effect was heterogenous among tuna species the GMR had a positive impact on the fishing productivity of yellowfin tuna (YFT) and skipjack tuna (SKI) fisheries, but did not have any significant effect on that of bigeye tuna (BET).

The potential conservation and fisheries benefits of such reserves have been debated in the public, the media, and the scientific literature. Little is known about their effectiveness for commercially valuable pelagic predators, especially for highly migratory species such as tuna and billfishes. Here we analyse the iconic Galapagos Marine Reserve, documenting interactions with and changes in associated tuna purse seine fisheries in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Using a combination of long-term onboard ob server data and a novel data set of high-resolution, remotely sensed vessel tracks (Automatic Identification System [AIS]), we reveal progressive divergence of tuna fishing effort, catch, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) trends in areas adjacent to the reserve from trends in the surrounding fished areas. Both data sets show a regionally unique hotspot of concentrated effort along the western reserve boundary now receiving >4-fold greater fishing effort density than the rest of the surrounding area.

This has resulted in a growing body of research that demonstrates how conservation can produce both positive and negative social, economic, cultural, health, and governance consequences for local communities. Yet, the results of social monitoring efforts are seldom applied to adaptively manage conservation projects. Greater attention is needed to incorporating the results of social impact assessments in long-term conservation management to minimize negative social consequences and maximize social benefits. We bring together insights from social impact assessment, adaptive management, social learning, knowledge coproduction, cross-scale governance, and environmental planning to propose a definition and framework for adaptive social impact management (ASIM). We define ASIM as the cyclical process of monitoring and adaptively managing social impacts over the life-span of an initiative through the 4 stages of profiling, learning, planning, and implementing. We outline 14 steps associated with the 4 stages of the ASIM cycle and provide guidance and potential methods for social-indicator development, predictive assessments of social impacts, monitoring and evaluation, communication of results, and identification and prioritization of management responses. Successful ASIM will be aided by engaging with best practices - including local engagement and collaboration in the process, transparent communication of results to stakeholders, collective deliberation on and choice of interventions, documentation of shared learning at the site level, and the scaling up of insights to inform higher-level conservation policies-to increase accountability, trust, and perceived legitimacy among stakeholders.

The protocol, agreed with local fishermen and the MPA authority, aimed at regulating the fishing pressure within the MPA in the perspective to balance conservation and socio-economic needs. Fishing was completely banned in the entire MPA from 2001 to 2005. In 2005 fishing resumed within the buffer zone surrounding no-take zones. From 2005 to 2008 we monitored artisanal professional fishing (strictly exerted by trammel nets) within the buffer MPA. and compared CPUE (kg km(-1) of net) with those obtained outside the MPA (where fishing grounds are fully open to professional and recreational fishing). Catches were higher inside than outside the MPA. Overall assemblage structures (evaluated on wet weight data) were significantly different from inside to outside the MPA. with the two most important commercial species, i.e. Mullus surmuletus and Scorpaena scrofa, accounting for similar to 40% of the catch inside the MPA and similar to 20% outside. in 2005, average CPUE within the MPA was about five-fold (similar to 50 kg km(-1) of net) the mean value obtained outside. Such value then declined and tended to stabilize around 25 kg km(-1) of net in 2007 and 2008. Average CPUE outside the MPA, instead, was similar to 10 kg km(-1) of net and remained quite stable across years. This study shows that the use of fishing co-management protocols within MPAs that properly involve local fishermen in the decision process is a promising approach to balance fishermen's and conservation needs.

After its establishment in 1998 fishing rights in the GMR were given exclusively to local fishers and only small-scale fishing is permitted. As tourism is exponentially increasing in Galapagos and the two most important fisheries resources have almost collapsed, fishers are seeking alternatives in the more profitable tourism sector. A recreational fishery called Pesca Artesanal Vivencial (PAV) was established in 2005, where tourists are taken out by local fishers on their boats to experience an authentic day at sea. Our research focused on the problems which occurred during the implementation of PAV and the suggestions of possible solutions for a future sustainable management. To assess the current situation of PAV in Galapagos information was gathered from captain's logbooks, port authorities, questionnaires, interviews and participatory workshops. Results show that the implementation of PAV has not been successful. Instead, regular catch and release sport fishing is becoming increasingly prevalent in the Galapagos Islands, organized by tourism agencies, without benefiting the local fishing sector. Stakeholders have very divergent interests, impeding the development of a sustainable management of PAV. Regulations need to be stricter with improved enforcement so that fishers are not only figureheads, but are the real owners who run the business. To allow PAV to develop into a sustainable income alternative for the local fishing sector in Galapagos, a long-term management plan needs to be established, taking into account the current problems described in this analysis.

For fishery species, reserves are often implemented alongside more conventional harvest strategies, including catch and size limits [2, 5]. However, catch and fish abundances observed post-intervention are often attributed to reserves, without explicitly estimating the potential contribution of concurrent management interventions [2, 3, 6-9]. Here we test a metapopulation model against observed fishery [10] and population [11] data for an important coral reef fishery (coral trout; Plectropomus spp.) in Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) to evaluate how the combined increase in reserve area [12] and reduction in fishing effort [13, 14] in 2004 influenced changes in fish stocks and the commercial fishery. We found that declines in catch, increases in catch rates, and increases in biomass since 2004 were substantially attributable to the integration of direct effort controls with the rezoning, rather than the rezoning alone. The combined management approach was estimated to have been more productive for fish and fisheries than if the rezoning had occurred alone and comparable to what would have been obtained with effort controls alone. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the direct effort controls prevented initial decreases in catch per unit effort that would have otherwise occurred with the rezoning. Our findings demonstrate that by concurrently restructuring the fishery, the conservation benefits of reserves were enhanced and the fishery cost of rezoning the reserve network was socialized, mitigating negative impacts on individual fishers.",16,2016,10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.022,WOS:000378661800017,field,BA,2009,MPA,Great Barrier Reef,5,medium,2004,highly,4.2,113520,344000,large,yes,state,Australia,tropical,Oceania,South West Pacific,coral reef,,,fish,coral trout,fished,mix,industrial,,fishery,food security,global,cpue,neutral,yes,tonne day-1,figure 1,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no variance nor sample size.

Changes in biomass, catch, effort and the economic benefits of fishing through time, under different protection scenarios, are analyzed. Despite the reduction of the area available for fishing, in the mid-term, the protected areas generate increased levels of biomass and greater benefits associated to the fishing activity, because of the spillover effect.

The resources exploited, on a yearly base, to maintain the natural capital itself alive (environmental flows) were accounted too. Emergy analysis is an accounting method useful to identify and convert in a single unit of measure all resources feeding a system. This allows the implementation of a system overall assessment and then the conversion of the obtained value in money terms. The studied MPAs are located in the northwestern part of Italy, are both tourism oriented and subdivided in zones with different protection degree. The habitats occupying both the MPAs bottoms have been identified together with the biomass stored on their surface, identifying units named FBHA (fishes and benthos habitat assemblage). The calculation of biomass stocked in the benthic organisms and in the fishes associated to each FBHA represents the basis for the assessment of MPA natural capital value and of environmental flows. From these values, the trophic network of each habitat was modeled allowing calculating the inputs to emergy analysis. The value of PF natural capital, expressed as resources employed through space and time to store the existing biomass, is equal to over 10 million Euros while the CT natural capital amounts to over 30 million. The high value habitats, where biomass is concentrated and stored, represent hot spots that are restricted in a limited surface and that can be maintained only if the resources they need are provided by adjacent lower value habitats. Through the applied methodology, a balance is performed to understand if an MPA is self-sufficient or dependent on external areas. Therefore, if an MPA is correctly planned, as CT is, the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the deficit FBHAs and even to export resources to other systems. In this case, the MPA lies in a surplus condition. On the contrary, the MPA is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then potentially posed at risk. If information about natural capital, flows and balance is synthesized in a Geographical Information System, it represents an effective tool to MPAs managers to measure the efficacy of protection established.

Human well-being and how it is derived from dynamic ecosystems is one area where local knowledge and perspectives are critical for designing interventions for sustainable pathways out of poverty. However, to realize the potential to enrich the understanding of complex dynamics for sustainability, there is a need for methods that engage holistic ways of perceiving human-nature interactions from multiple worldviews that also acknowledge inequalities between scientific and other forms of knowledge. To date, photovoice has been used to elicit local knowledge and perspectives about ecosystem changes and ecosystem services. We expand this to explore the utility of the method for facilitating the mobilization of plural insights on human well-being, which is subject to complex social-ecological dynamics, and its role in processes for coproduction of knowledge that acknowledges the need for equity and usefulness for all actors. Drawing on two cases, one in community-based marine protected areas in Kenya and one dealing with agricultural decline and rural-urban migration in South Africa, we demonstrate two modes of application of photovoice: as a scoping exercise and as a deep learning tool. The studies descriptively illustrate how photovoice can depict the hidden and often neglected intangible connections to ecosystems, plural and disaggregated perceptions of complex social-ecological dynamics, and issues of access and distribution of ecosystem benefits. The studies also show how photovoice can encourage equitable participation of nonacademic actors in research processes and in particular contribute to mobilization of knowledge and translation of knowledge across knowledge systems.

This timely inquiry comes in a period when participatory resource management approaches are increasingly being applied to overcome the perpetual cycles of poverty in which poor resource-dependent people find themselves, i.e., social-ecological traps. Much of the literature on social-ecological traps has focused on identifying conditions, factors, and responses that are important in, for example, alleviating systemic poverty or developing sustainable resource management systems. However, insufficient focus has been placed on understanding the practical processes by which strategies are implemented, and how these can reflexively affect the system itself. Drawing from a case study of a locally managed marine area in Indonesia, we examine the interactions between a nongovernment organization and a target community during the implementation of a fisheries management plan. Applying insights from rural development studies, we show how external interventions, designed to pull people out of social-ecological traps, are operationalized into forms that make them locally familiar and appropriate through actions of community brokers and processes of institutional bricolage.

Thus, many feared decreased local tourism and resultant economic loss due to limitations on activities within the MPA. The MPA has, however, led to an increase in scuba in the area. This research evaluates the importance of scuba divers as a source of tourism and income for the local economies surrounding the Portofino MPA. Research indicates that spending is a better criterion for analysis than numbers of visitors to an attraction or area. Therefore, understanding spending behaviour is important in influencing the benefits derived from scuba diving tourism. While scuba diving is a popular activity worldwide and a drawcard for many destinations, little research analysing their spending behaviour is available. This research was conducted at the Portofino MPA, Italy, where more than 700 questionnaires were completed during June/July 2016 with the assistance of eight of approximately 20 diving operators in the area. The results provide dive operators and the destination marketing organisation with information on specific market segments and insight into the spending behaviour of divers.

It does so by firstly noting that the various types of MPA governance discussed in the literature correspond to the ways of organizing, perceiving and justifying social relations recognized in Cultural Theory. The article continues by setting out how Cultural Theory helps to explain when and why MPA regimes succeed or fail to reach their goals. In particular, the article highlights the practical importance of accommodating all ways of organizing and perceiving social relations in any MPA management plan.

The intended goal of traditional fisheries management is to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY) from the targeted species, which on many occasions affect the targeted species as well as the entire ecosystem. Marine reserves are often acclaimed as the marine ecosystem management tool. Few attempts have been made to generalize the ecological effects of marine reserve on MSY policy. We examine here how MSY and population level in a prey-predator system are affected by the low, medium and high reserve size under different possible scenarios. Our simulation works shows that low reserve area, the value of MSY for prey exploitation is maximum when both prey and predator species have fast movement rate. For medium reserve size, our analysis revealed that the maximum value of MSY for prey exploitation is obtained when prey population has fast movement rate and predator population has slow movement rate. For high re-serve area, the maximum value of MSY for prey's exploitation is very low compared to the maximum value of MSY for prey's exploitation in case of low and medium reserve. On the other hand, for low and medium reserve area, MSY for predator exploitation is maximum when both the species have fast movement rate. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V.

For fishery species, reserves are often implemented alongside more conventional harvest strategies, including catch and size limits [2, 5]. However, catch and fish abundances observed post-intervention are often attributed to reserves, without explicitly estimating the potential contribution of concurrent management interventions [2, 3, 6-9]. Here we test a metapopulation model against observed fishery [10] and population [11] data for an important coral reef fishery (coral trout; Plectropomus spp.) in Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) to evaluate how the combined increase in reserve area [12] and reduction in fishing effort [13, 14] in 2004 influenced changes in fish stocks and the commercial fishery. We found that declines in catch, increases in catch rates, and increases in biomass since 2004 were substantially attributable to the integration of direct effort controls with the rezoning, rather than the rezoning alone. The combined management approach was estimated to have been more productive for fish and fisheries than if the rezoning had occurred alone and comparable to what would have been obtained with effort controls alone. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the direct effort controls prevented initial decreases in catch per unit effort that would have otherwise occurred with the rezoning. Our findings demonstrate that by concurrently restructuring the fishery, the conservation benefits of reserves were enhanced and the fishery cost of rezoning the reserve network was socialized, mitigating negative impacts on individual fishers.",16,2016,10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.022,WOS:000378661800017,field,BA,2009,MPA,Great Barrier Reef,5,medium,2004,highly,4.2,113520,344000,large,yes,state,Australia,tropical,Oceania,South West Pacific,coral reef,,,fish,coral trout,fished,mix,industrial,,fishery,food security,global,catch,positive,yes,ton year-1,figure 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,decrease of catches because reduction of the total allowable catch,,

Since tourism can be the main source of economic benefits for many marine reserves worldwide, ignoring tourism objectives in the design process might lead to sub-optimal outcomes. To incorporate tourism benefits into marine reserve design, we develop a bioeconomic model that tracks tourism and fisheries revenues through time for different management options and location characteristics. Results from the model show that accounting for tourism benefits will ultimately motivate greater ocean protection. Our findings demonstrate that marine reserves are part of the optimal economic solution even in situations with optimal fisheries management and low tourism value relative to fisheries. The extent of optimal protection depends on specific location characteristics, such as tourism potential and other local amenities, and the species recreational divers care about. Additionally, as tourism value increases, optimal reserve area also increases.

Advice to the Australian and Queensland governments that supported this initiative predicted these additional closures would generate minimal (10%) initial reductions in both catch and landed value within the GBR area, with recovery of catches becoming apparent after three years. To test these predictions, commercial fisheries data from the GBR area and from the two adjacent (non-GBR) areas of Queensland were compared for the periods immediately before and after the closures were implemented. The observed means for total annual catch and value within the GBR declined from pre-closure (2000-2003) levels of 12780 Mg and Australian $160 million, to initial post-closure (2005-2008) levels of 8143 Mg and $102 million; decreases of 35% and 36% respectively. Because the reference areas in the non-GBR had minimal changes in catch and value, the beyond-BACI (before, after, control, impact) analyses estimated initial net reductions within the GBR of 35% for both total catch and value. There was no evidence of recovery in total catch levels or any comparative improvement in catch rates within the GBR nine years after implementation. These results are not consistent with the advice to governments that the closures would have minimal initial impacts and rapidly generate benefits to fisheries in the GBR through increased juvenile recruitment and adult spillovers. Instead, the absence of evidence of recovery in catches to date currently supports an alternative hypothesis that where there is already effective fisheries management, the closing of areas to all fishing will generate reductions in overall catches similar to the percentage of the fished area that is closed.",24,2015,10.1890/14-1427.1,WOS:000356898400003,field,BA,2013,MPA,Great Barrier Reef,8,medium,2004,highly,4.2,113520,344000,large,yes,state,Australia,tropical,Oceania,South West Pacific,coral reef,,,fish,mix,fished,mix,industrial,,fishery,food security,global,cpue,neutral,yes,kg boat-1 day-1,figure 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,which explains why no change in cpue.

Using a combination of genetic parentage and relatedness analysis, we measured larval subsidies to local fisheries replenishment for Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus: Sparidae) from a small (5.2 km(2)), well-established, temperate, coastal MPA in northern New Zealand. Adult snapper within the MPA contributed an estimated 10.6% (95% CI: 5.5-18.1%) of newly settled juveniles to surrounding areas (approx. 400 km(2)), with no decreasing trend in contributions up to 40 km away. Biophysical modelling of larval dispersal matched experimental data, showing larvae produced inside the MPA dispersed over a comparable distance.

This research, adopting a grounded visualization methodology, explains how the artisanal fishing sector has undergone and been affected by 'spatial squeezing'. Our results show that artisanal fishermen have been forced to give up fishing grounds or co-exist with other uses to the point where the ability to fish is becoming increasingly challenging. These difficulties might escalate with the advent of the marine protected areas (MPAs) which encompass nearly half of the inshore fishing zones. Since there does not seem to be effective MPA consultation mechanisms that elicit the real social, cultural and economic value of artisanal fishing grounds, fishermen feel threatened, alienated and disempowered.

This trend is reflected in England's waters, where 34.7% of waters are protected. MPA network creation can displace activities (primarily fisheries) that are thought to be incompatible with the habitats and species of conservation importance that the network has been established to protect. There is also an obligation on the UK Government to ensure that all of its waters achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020 under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The designation of MPAs and the subsequent introduction of management measures that displace activities may result in unintended impacts/consequences on protected benthic habitats or species within (a) the MPA where management measures have been introduced, (b) other MPAs or (c) wider UK or international waters. An incomplete understanding of the extent and type of fishing that is occurring within the MPA network (and throughout English waters in general), coupled with a paucity of information regarding how fishing effort is displaced as a result of MPA designation, may hinder the achievement of both GES by 2020 and MPA management goals.

However, faced with other pressing issues, ocean management reform has not yet received significant traction from the government, a pattern seen in many locations. Spatial planning processes often struggle during the proposal, planning, or implementation phases due to stakeholder opposition and/or government wariness to change. Conflict among stakeholders about management reform has also proven to be a deterrent to MSP application in many locations. With these obstacles in mind, a detailed stakeholder survey was conducted in Bermuda to determine awareness, attitudes and perceptions regarding ocean health, threats to ocean environments, the effectiveness of current ocean management, and possible future changes to management. How perceptions vary for different types of stakeholders and how attitudes about specific concerns relate to attitudes about management changes were examined. Overall, the results indicate a high degree of support for spatial planning and ocean zoning and a high level of concordance even among stakeholder groups that are typically assumed to have conflicting agendas. However, attitudes were not entirely homogeneous, particularly when delving into details about specific management changes. For example, commercial fishers were generally less in favor, relative to other stakeholder groups, of increasing regulations on ocean uses with the notable exception of regulations for recreational fishing.

Due to their sheer size, complex sociopolitical realities, and distinct local cultural perspectives and economic needs, implementing and managing LSMPAs successfully creates a number of human dimensions challenges. It is timely and important to explore the human dimensions of LSMPAs. This paper draws on the results of a global Think Tank on the Human Dimensions of Large Scale Marine Protected Areas involving 125 people from 17 countries, including representatives from government agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, professionals, industry, cultural/indigenous leaders and LSMPA site managers. The overarching goal of this effort was to be proactive in understanding the issues and developing best management practices and a research agenda that address the human dimensions of LSMPAs. Identified best management practices for the human dimensions of LSMPAs included: integration of culture and traditions, effective public and stakeholder engagement, maintenance of livelihoods and wellbeing, promotion of economic sustainability, conflict management and resolution, transparency and matching institutions, legitimate and appropriate governance, and social justice and empowerment. A shared human dimensions research agenda was developed that included priority topics under the themes of scoping human dimensions, governance, politics, social and economic outcomes, and culture and tradition. The authors discuss future directions in researching and incorporating human dimensions into LSMPAs design and management, reflect on this global effort to co-produce knowledge and re-orient practice on the human dimensions of LSMPAs, and invite others to join a nascent community of practice on the human dimensions of large-scale marine conservation.",68,2017,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.08.002,WOS:000413279900031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Recreational fishing is strictly regulated inside Italian Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and is generally allocated to local residents, mainly to reduce the tensions caused by limitations of access to the resources. The aim of this study was to provide an analysis of recreational fishing activities within the Portofino MPA (Mediterranean Sea), to assess the possible impact on the local fish stocks and to plan potential management actions. Furthermore, some serious inconsistencies on the minimum lengths of fish caught as defined by law relative to the minimum size of first reproduction are discussed. Since 2014, all anglers exploiting the Portofino MPA have been obliged to fill out a logbook. The compilation of these was not completely satisfactory, when compared with a group of reliable anglers whose catches were accurately monitored, but allowed for estimated yields of about 24kg/angler/yr. After 15years of protection, the fish biomass has increased within the Portofino MPA, generating a positive spillover effect. At the same time, it has attracted many anglers whose gross harvesting was estimated at about 8t/year, representing about the 8% of the total yield of the local small-scale fishery.",12,2017,10.1111/fme.12241,WOS:000409300700004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"not social mechanisms (nb of users, no control)",

In recent years, a number of marine reserves or no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented worldwide, and some MPAs have shown ecological and economic benefits. However, consideration for coordinated competition between institutions, a central for successful resource management, is often omitted in research on effective MPA management. Given increasing discussions on implementing MPAs in the high seas, where international fisheries often exemplify the tragedy of the commons, understanding potential competition between institutions can affect MPA management. With this in mind, we aimed to gain generic insight into non-cooperative fisheries management with MPAs. Specifically, we explored the effect of MPA establishment on (1) competition strength between fishery institutions, (2) fish population abundance resulting from the competition, and (3) distribution of the gross fishery profit between institutions. To approach these questions, we developed a minimal model that accounts a non-cooperative behavior of fishery institutions and population dynamics under the MPAs management. We demonstrate that, given a small price-to-cost ratio, a prominent increase in fishery competition could occur as a result of introducing an MPA, leading to reductions in fisheries profits and fish population abundance, and greater unevenness in distribution of the gross fishery profit. Intensified fishery competition was typically observed in the case where the rate of population exchange between the fishing grounds and the MPA is not large, and the fraction of the MPA is intermediate, suggesting that regulation agreements will be required to coordinate the competitive harvesting.

Some conflicts have an economic base, which, once understood, can be used to resolve associated socioenvironmental problems. We addressed how the fish trade in an MPA that combines no-take zones and tourist or resident zones creates incentives for increased fisheries. We performed a value chain analysis following the fish supply and trade through interviews that assessed consumer demand and preference. The results showed a simple and closed value chain driven by tourism (70% of the consumption). Both tourists and local consumers preferred high trophic level species (predators), but the former preferred large pelagics (tuna and dolphinfish) and the latter preferred reef species (barracuda and snapper). Pelagic predators are caught with fresh sardines, which are sometimes located only in the no-take zone. Pelagic species are mainly served as fillet, and the leftover fish parts end up as waste, an issue that, if properly addressed, can help reduce fishing pressure. Whereas some of the target species may be sustainable (e.g., dolphinfish), others are more vulnerable (e.g., wahoo) and should not be intensively fished. We advise setting stricter limits to the number of tourists visiting MPAs, according to their own capacity and peculiarities, in order to avoid conflicts with conservations goals through incentives for increased resource use.

Our reserve design approach uses spatially explicit population models and considers ontogenetic migration, larval and adult movement. We show that yield and persistence are negatively related, but that both objectives can be maximized simultaneously during planning.

This paper argues for effective governance to support processes that apply principles of sustainable development and an ecosystem approach to decide about economic activities at sea such as aquaculture. It describes opportunities, benefits and synergies between aquaculture and MPAs as a basis for wider debate. The scope is not a comprehensive analysis of aquaculture and MPAs, but rather to present examples of positive interactions between aquaculture activities and MPAs. The unintended negative consequences are also discussed to present balanced arguments. This work draws from four workshops held in 2015 and 2016 and used to collect information from about 100 experts representing various sectors and perspectives. It is recognized that aquaculture is an important activity in terms of sustainable development. It can play a role in providing food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience, in particular for MPA local communities, and contribute to wild stock enhancement, as an alternative to overfishing and for providing services to the ecosystem. This study showed that there is a need from both aquaculture and MPA sides for clarity of objectives and willingness for open and extensive dialogue. The paper concludes by describing a number of tools and methods for supporting greater synergies between aquaculture and MPAs.

While managing single species in data-rich environments has been largely effective, perhaps the greatest challenge facing fishery managers is how to deal with mixed stocks of fish with a range of life histories that reside in the same location. Because many fishing gears are nonselective, and the costs of making gear selective can be high, a particular problem is bycatch of weak stocks. This problem is most severe when the weak stock is long-lived and has low fecundity and thus requires a very long recovery time once overfished. We investigate the role that marine reserves might play in solving this challenging and ubiquitous problem in ecosystem-based management. Evidence for marine reserves' potential to manage fisheries in an ecosystem context has been mixed, so we develop a heuristic strategic mathematical model to obtain general conclusions about the merits of managing multispecies fisheries by using reserves relative to managing them with nonspatial approaches. We show that for many fisheries, yields of strong stocks can be increased, and persistence of weak stocks can be ensured, by using marine reserves rather than by using traditional nonspatial approaches alone. Thus, reserves have a distinct advantage as a management tool in many of the most critical multispecies settings. We also show how the West Coast ground-fish fishery of the United States meets these conditions, suggesting that management by reserves may be a superior option in that case.",17,2017,10.1073/pnas.1705169114,WOS:000408095300031,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Studies discerning spatial patterns in marine management have disproportionately focused on global networks. This paper instead considers the single country context of Japan to illuminate within-country drivers of area-based conservation and fishery management. A dataset containing potentially relevant socioeconomic, environmental, and fisheries factors was assembled and used to model prefecture-level counts of marine protected areas (MPAs) and territorial use rights for fisheries (TURFs) throughout Japan's waters. Several factors were found to significantly influence the number of TURFs in a particular area, whereas MPA patterns of use remain largely unexplained. TURFs are frequently noted as more suitable for managing fisheries of low mobility species and our analysis finds greater use of TURFs in areas that rely heavily on benthic catch. The number of trading ports was also found to be positively related to TURF distributions, suggesting economic infrastructure may influence the use of this fisheries management tool. In-line with global analyses, MPA patterns of use were not found to be significantly related to any of the potential explanatory variables after correcting for the number of statistical comparisons that were carried out. Differences in our ability to model the use of TURFs and MPAs may arise due to the narrower objectives associated with the former (e.g., income, employment) in comparison to the often broad and varied goals that motivate use of the latter.",4,2017,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.05.005,WOS:000404490500008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms (geographical distribution of MPAs),

Although shark sanctuaries cover almost as much area globally as marine protected areas (MPAs), their success has yet to be evaluated. Here, key features and regulatory details for eleven shark sanctuaries (covering 3% of global ocean area) are summarized, highlighting their commonalities and differences. Catch data are then used to shed light on the impact current shark sanctuaries could have on shark catch, foreign fleets, trade and abundance. Based on this comparative analysis, recommendations are made to implement program evaluation measures within existing and future shark sanctuaries that would explicitly outline goals and measures of success or failure. In summary, although shark sanctuaries may have the intended effect of reducing shark mortality, there appears a need to address bycatch within shark sanctuary regulations, and to collect baseline data that can be used to monitor sanctuary effectiveness.",36,2017,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.05.004,WOS:000404490500011,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,shark sanctuaries not comparable to MPA effect

Advice to the Australian and Queensland governments that supported this initiative predicted these additional closures would generate minimal (10%) initial reductions in both catch and landed value within the GBR area, with recovery of catches becoming apparent after three years. To test these predictions, commercial fisheries data from the GBR area and from the two adjacent (non-GBR) areas of Queensland were compared for the periods immediately before and after the closures were implemented. The observed means for total annual catch and value within the GBR declined from pre-closure (2000-2003) levels of 12780 Mg and Australian $160 million, to initial post-closure (2005-2008) levels of 8143 Mg and $102 million; decreases of 35% and 36% respectively. Because the reference areas in the non-GBR had minimal changes in catch and value, the beyond-BACI (before, after, control, impact) analyses estimated initial net reductions within the GBR of 35% for both total catch and value. There was no evidence of recovery in total catch levels or any comparative improvement in catch rates within the GBR nine years after implementation. These results are not consistent with the advice to governments that the closures would have minimal initial impacts and rapidly generate benefits to fisheries in the GBR through increased juvenile recruitment and adult spillovers. Instead, the absence of evidence of recovery in catches to date currently supports an alternative hypothesis that where there is already effective fisheries management, the closing of areas to all fishing will generate reductions in overall catches similar to the percentage of the fished area that is closed.",24,2015,10.1890/14-1427.1,WOS:000356898400003,field,BA,2013,MPA,Great Barrier Reef,8,medium,2004,highly,4.2,113520,344000,large,yes,state,Australia,tropical,Oceania,South West Pacific,coral reef,,,fish,mix,fished,mix,industrial,,fishery,food security,global,catch,negative,yes,Mg year-1,figure 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,decrease of catch because decrease in fishing effort.

Yet, the extent to which marine reserves are globally interconnected and able to effectively seed areas, where fisheries are most critical for food and livelihood security is largely unknown. Using a hydrodynamic model of larval dispersal, we predict that most marine reserves are not interconnected by currents and that their potential benefits to fishing areas are presently limited, since countries with high dependency on coastal fisheries receive very little larval supply from marine reserves. This global mismatch could be reversed, however, by placing new marine reserves in areas sufficiently remote to minimize social and economic costs but sufficiently connected through sea currents to seed the most exploited fisheries and endangered ecosystems.",25,2017,10.1038/ncomms16039,WOS:000405115100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms (spillover),

Lacking perfect information, policy makers are at risk of undercounting non-priced values and services, leading to biases in policy decisions in favor of services valued through markets. Furthermore, understanding users' valuation of specific site attributes, such as marine biodiversity, can contribute to effective policy decisions. This paper presents a non-market valuation of private recreational boaters (PRBs) in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary located in California, USA, using data from an intercept survey conducted in 2006 and 2007. A Random Utility Model is used to estimate PRBs' daily trip values and the importance of specific site attributes. The average consumer surplus was estimated at $48.62 per trip, with a total non-market value of non-consumptive private recreational boating of $86,325 annually. PRBs show a preference for visiting locations with lower exposure to prevailing winds and greater species richness and abundance, which to the authors' knowledge is the first time that PRBs have been found to value biological diversity in site choices. Furthermore, this suggests that improved biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems contribute to better recreational experiences. The results from this study reveal the importance of including non-market services and stakeholder's preferences into policy decisions.",3,2017,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.03.017,WOS:000402213400011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,willingness to pay,

Here, using the distributions of 102 biodiversity features and 7 extractive uses we trial the systematic conservation planning software Zonation as a decision-support tool to facilitate progress towards New Zealand's commitment to establishing a representative network of MPAs while providing for economic development. Our results indicate that: (i) New Zealand's existing MPAs provide on average 70% less representation of the input biodiversity features than would be achieved by an MPA network of equivalent area designed from the outset using Zonation; (ii) small increases in the geographic extent of existing protection results in rapid increases in representation of the selected biodiversity features when systematic conservation planning software is used to inform expansion of existing protection; and (iii) the impacts on existing resource users of an expanded MPA system can be minimized by using Zonation to identify areas that increase biodiversity representation, while avoiding areas where existing uses may be incompatible with marine protection. These results demonstrate the utility of systematic conservation planning software as a decision-support tool within a broader social process for MPA network design and implementation. The iterative application of tools such as Zonation during participatory processes that balance alternative uses could potentially lead to more informed, efficient and socially enduring outcomes that enhance the ability to establish representative MPA networks.",12,2017,10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.011,WOS:000405881600016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,methodology,

The policymakers are demanding information on the economic benefits of designating the island as an MPA. Therefore, this paper describes an attempt to measure the economic benefits, using a contingent valuation (CV) survey of 600 randomly selected households in Korea in 2015. We used a one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice (DC) question to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) responses, and applied a spike model to deal with WTP responses of zero. The yearly mean WTP per household was computed to be KRW 3,590 (USD 3.15) for the next 10years, an estimate that is statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 67.2 billion (USD 59.1 million) per year. The present value of the total economic benefits amounts to KRW 534.0 billion (USD 469.2 million) using a social discount rate of 5.5%.

Data suggests catches have declined, likely due to over-exploitation. In response, the community of Sainte Luce has established a locally managed marine area (LMMA) to manage their lobster fishery, including a 13 km 2 periodic no take zone (NTZ). Participatory monitoring data were used to assess compliance, identify changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) associated with the NTZ and consider the short-term value of the NTZ. Compliance is low for measures dictated by national legislation (minimum landing size (MLS), national closed season, prohibition on landing berried females), but may be higher for those designed by the community (NTZ). Upon NTZ opening in July 2015, an estimated 435% increase in catch was observed compared with the mean for the preceding five months, a product of increased effort and significantly higher CPUE. Zero Altered Negative Binomial modelling showed CPUE was significantly higher during the NTZ opening in 2015 and in 2016 when the opening period had been moved. Whilst it is unlikely that tangible ecological benefits have accrued from NTZ operation, there have been important socio-economic effects. Specifically, there was a 33% increase in the price fishers received, a significant effect at the bottom of the value chain. Temporary increases in catch and income acted as a catalyst, engaging neighbouring communities in fishery management, resulting in two additional NTZs. Attention is drawn to the fact that current national legislation may be sub-optimal and should be reviewed. Successful management of the regional fishery will require the state and industry to support communities in adopting community-based management. The NTZ measure considered here may be an effective tool to achieve this.",2,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0177858,WOS:000401672400103,field,,,fishery closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,cpue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,periodic no take zone

We present a bioeconomic model of the interaction between a commercial wild fishery and capturebased aquaculture that depends on harvest of wild juveniles. We assume that aquaculture reduces the intrinsic growth rate of the wild fish stock due to wild caught juveniles used as seeds, influencing wild stock size and commercial harvest. This may increase the economic conflicts between fishers and farmers. Introducing a marine protected area is expected to reduce these conflicts. The model considers both open access and economically optimal management regimes outside the marine protected area using numerical simulation. The numerical results show that a marine protected area of a certain size may increase economic benefits of both fishers and farmers in the case of optimal management, and enhance wild catch outside the reserve when there is open access.",2,2017,10.1111/nrm.12122,WOS:000403277600001,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

To be effective, they require some alteration of people's use and access to marine resources, which they will resist if they do not perceive associated benefits. Stakeholders' support is crucial to ecological success of MPAs, and their support is likely to depend on their capacity to adapt to and benefit from MPAs. We examined the influence of social adaptive capacity (SAC) on perceived benefits of MPAs in Siquijor, Philippines, in the Coral Triangle. This region has substantial biodiversity and a population of over 120 million people, many of them dependent on marine resources for food and income. The region has many MPAs, most of which are managed under decentralized governance systems. We collected survey data from 540 households in 19 villages with associated MPAs. We evaluated the influence of multiple SAC variables (e.g., occupational multiplicity and social capital) on perceived benefits with decision trees (CHAID) and qualitatively analyzed this relationship with respect to types and recipients of benefits. Our models revealed the key role of social capital, particularly trust in leadership, in influencing perceptions of benefits ((2) = 14.762, p = 0.000). A path analysis revealed that perceptions of distributional equity were a key mechanism through which social capital affected perceived MPA benefits (root mean-square error of approximation = 0.050). Building social capital and equity within communities could lead to more effective management of MPAs and thus to expenditure of fewer resources relative to, for example, regulation enforcement.",21,2017,10.1111/cobi.12808,WOS:000395713800008,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not focused on MPAs outcomes (focuses on which factors influence perceived benefits from MPAs)

This study aims to analyze the perceptions and socioeconomic characteristics of divers and artisanal fishers of an offshore MPA, located in Brazilian waters. Data on the perceptions, conflicts, and management of the MPA were gathered through questionnaires and interviews with local actors. The results show that scuba divers and fishers consider the MPA to be very important for biodiversity. They also consider their collaboration in participative management to be of considerable importance, even though they do not form part of the administration. For local actors, the area helps foster the preservation of the marine environment and benefits recreational diving, tourism, and artisanal fishery in local communities. Divers and fishers use the resources and space of the offshore area differently, which results in diverging perceptions and conflicts. Divers propose restricted protection (No-Take Zones), while fishers propose that the MPA should be used exclusively by the poor local communities for artisanal fishing. Conflicts arising from inefficient public administration (lack of environmental zoning, management plans, and participative management) and illegal use of the MPA were also identified. Data stemming from the local actors themselves are central to reducing the conflicts and improving public policies on offshore marine conservation.",11,2017,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.11.016,WOS:000393012200013,field,perception,2014,MPA,Pedra da Risca do Meio,17,,1997,PPA,,NA,33.2,,NA,state,Brazil,tropical,South America,South West Atlantic,coral reef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,data not clear enough on the direction of the mechanism

CBETM ensures community involvement for effective sustainable management as well as supporting environmental conservation practices. To achieve the objectives of the study, a quantitative method was applied, and data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The major findings of this study indicate that environmental knowledge for sustainable development, motivation to be involved with CBETM, perceived economic impact of CBETM, perceived social impact of CBETM and perceived cultural impact of CBETM have a greater influence on intention to participate in CBETM. It implies that these factors lead to the formation of positive intention in managing CBETM and promote community participation. This study will help policymakers to take relevant management policies to increase environmental knowledge for sustainable development, to motivate local community in CBETM, and to increase economic, social and cultural benefits among residents. These benefits encourage community involvement in CBETM that will support environmental planning to ensure environmental conservation practices among tourists and residents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering changes in time and space as well as internal and external influences, the study faced many difficulties in dealing with the dynamics of MPA environments. At the same time, it showed clearly the control over development and fishery activities by several MPA relevant regulations, improvements of the ecological function by the regrowth of eelgrass, an increase in some fish species due to the same regrowth, and expansion of social networks deriving from the restoration activity. The study also revealed convincing evidence that self-motivated MPA management practice by fishers under the Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs), in conjunction with other mixed management systems such as Satoumi, could lead to flexible and long-term efforts for improving food security, livelihoods, and the marine environment.

We assessed the effectiveness of eight periodically harvested closures (PHCs), the most common form of management within Fijian LMMAs, focusing on two outcomes: protection of resource units and biodiversity conservation. Of the eight PHCs, only one provided biodiversity benefits, whereas three were moderately successful in protecting resource units (targeted fish biomass). Protection of resource units was more likely when PHCs were harvested less frequently, less recently, and when total fish biomass in open areas was lower. Our findings further suggest that monitoring, enforcement, and clearly defined boundaries are critical, less frequent harvesting regimes are advised, and culturally appropriate management incentives are needed. Although PHCs have some potential to protect resource units, they are not recommended as a single strategy for broad-scale biodiversity conservation.",21,2017,10.1080/08941920.2017.1315654,WOS:000407554200005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms (fish diversity and biomass),

Marine protected areas (MPAs), a form of spatial management in which parts of the ocean are regulated to fishing, are now a common tool in MSP for conserving marine biodiversity and managing fisheries. However, the use of MPAs in MSP often neglects, or simplifies, the redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities inside and outside of MPAs following their implementation. This redistribution of effort can have important implications for effective MSP. Using long-term (14yr) aerial surveys of boats at the California Channel Islands, we examined the spatial redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities and their drivers following MPA establishment. Our data represent 6yr of information before the implementation of an MPA network and 8yr after implementation. Different types of boats responded in different ways to the closures, ranging from behaviors by commercial dive boats that support the hypothesis of fishing-the-line, to behaviors by urchin, sport fishing, and recreational boats that support the theory of ideal free distribution. Additionally, we found that boats engaged in recreational activities targeted areas that are sheltered from large waves and located near their home ports, while boats engaged in fishing activities also avoided high wave areas but were not constrained by the distance to their home ports. We did not observe the expected pattern of effort concentration near MPA borders for some boat types; this can be explained by the habitat preference of certain activities (for some activities, the desired habitat attributes are not inside the MPAs), species' biology (species such as urchins where the MPA benefit would likely come from larval export rather than adult spillover), or policy-infraction avoidance. The diversity of boat responses reveals variance from the usual simplified assumption that all extractive boats respond similarly to MPA establishment. Our work is the first empirical study to analyze the response of both commercial and recreational boats to closure.

In 1991, Chile established a national coastal TURF policy that gave legal authority to assign exclusive access rights to artisanal fisher organizations. In 2014, there were several hundred TURFs decreed to fisher organizations in different biophysical and socioeconomic settings. To date, research assessing TURF implementation has generally been based on a few case studies and have had mixed results. Here, we present results from a survey of 535 fishers from 55 different artisanal fisher organizations. The survey consisted of three open-ended questions that explore users' perceptions of the main problems, benefits, and improvements concerning assigned TURFs. We also sampled 55 presidents of artisanal fisher organizations to explore how they perceived the accomplishments of TURFs. Main key problems, as perceived by fishers, include increased costs associated with surveillance and poaching, and the variability and sometimes lack of financial returns. Despite strong price drops in exported species, TURFs have provided incentives for innovation and stewardship, and fishers are generally unwilling to relinquish them. In fact, fishers define TURF benefits in multiple dimensions, which include conservation/ ecological and territorial empowerment. Fisher presidents stress that although expectations of economic benefits have not been fully realized, territorial empowerment is a critical benefit. Through the analysis of fishers' perceptions on solutions to TURFs' problems, we highlight the development of stocking activities, combining TURFs with marine reserves, food traceability, and what we call BIO+ seafood-products that have associated biodiversity benefits.",39,2017,10.5343/bms.2015.1082,WOS:000393731900004,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TURF no comparable to MPA

The regular presence of sea lions on the island is not only a touristic attraction in the region, but also a problem to the fishery community. This community faces economic impacts in its activities due to fish depredation caused by sea lions. Because of this issue, the perceptions and attitudes of different stakeholders from the region are important to be considered by managers, so that a realistic and decentralized action plan can be designed. The goal of this study was to analyze how different local stakeholders perceived the Wildlife Refuge of IIha dos Lobos. Additionally, how these stakeholders differed from each other in terms of attitudes, knowledge and perceptions. In October 2011, January and March 2012, face-to-face interview surveys were conducted with fishermen and tourists, and drop-off questionnaires surveys with business, and tourism professional and teachers, in a total of 150 questionnaires, 30 for each group. The results indicated existence of differences across the five stakeholder groups. It was also suggested that non-direct stakeholders had a more favorable view of the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos and the sea lion, whereas direct stakeholder (the fishermen) saw it as an obstacle to their fisheries activities.

However, the current status of conservation area funding is widely detached from the need, and this disparity is intensified in developing countries. Therefore, identifying and valuing the revenue streams and finance needs of conservation areas is an important step in the process to become financial sustainable. This paper assesses the revenue potential of conservation areas in Mozambique national parks and reserves. The analysis describes the revenue generation of 93 conservation areas in Mozambique in 2013 to (i) the economy, (ii) the Government of Mozambique and conservation area management authorities, as well as (iii) respective communities bordering conservation areas. The analysis determined that the total annual revenue generation within the conservation area network was USD 24.4 million in 2013 from tourism-linked activities. The component of total revenue that accrued to either national Government of Mozambique or conservation area management was USD 3.33 million in 2013, and USD 606,500 of this accrued to communities surrounding conservation areas. The research has demonstrated that revenue generation of the conservation area network contributes approximately 10% to the tourism sector's total contribution to the economy of Mozambique. In addition, this research highlights the difficulties of revenue generation from conservation areas in least developed countries and the effects of a lack of data on justifying the value of a conservation area network from an economic perspective.",6,2017,10.1177/1467358415613119,WOS:000390854300003,field,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mostly terrestrial reserves

Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish boxes (buffer zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls. (3) They maintain the natural size and age structure of the populations, hence maximizing potential fecundity, allowing biomass export to occur from core to regulated areas, dampening the fluctuations derived from deviations from the theoretical optimal effort in the fishing zone.",10,2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.0245,WOS:000457690600243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Within MPAs, traditional artisanal fishing is competing for space and resources with increasing recreational fishing, likely leading to interacting ecological effects. Such effects are difficult to unravel, given the multispecies character of both fisheries and the complexity of the food webs upon which they both impact. To address these issues, we developed an Ecopath and EcoTroph trophic model for the Portofino MPA case study (NW Mediterranean), in particular to (1) identify keystone species and assess fishing impact on them; (2) analyze the interacting impact of artisanal and recreational fishing on ecosystem biomass and trophic structure; and (3) assess the impact of recreational fishing on artisanal fishing catches. Two high trophic level predator (HTLP) groups coupled important keystone roles with high sensitivity to fishing pressure and should thus be regarded as sentinels to be prioritized for the definition of management actions. Recreational fishing had the widest impact on the food web, strongly impacting HTLP. Simulation of different mortality scenarios for each fishery highlighted that the ecosystem is far from its carrying capacity for HTLP. Forbidding recreational fishing allowed a 24% increase in HTLP biomass and benefited artisanal fishing by increased availability of HTLP catches. Artisanal fishing alone could instead be maintained with a moderate impact on the food web. Overall, Ecopath and EcoTroph modeling is a valuable tool to advise MPA management, but it is essential to increase data availability and quality by developing long-term monitoring programs on key species and on artisanal and recreational fishing.",18,2016,10.1002/ecs2.1601,WOS:000390136700019,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,artisanal,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

The regular presence of sea lions on the island is not only a touristic attraction in the region, but also a problem to the fishery community. This community faces economic impacts in its activities due to fish depredation caused by sea lions. Because of this issue, the perceptions and attitudes of different stakeholders from the region are important to be considered by managers, so that a realistic and decentralized action plan can be designed. The goal of this study was to analyze how different local stakeholders perceived the Wildlife Refuge of IIha dos Lobos. Additionally, how these stakeholders differed from each other in terms of attitudes, knowledge and perceptions. In October 2011, January and March 2012, face-to-face interview surveys were conducted with fishermen and tourists, and drop-off questionnaires surveys with business, and tourism professional and teachers, in a total of 150 questionnaires, 30 for each group. The results indicated existence of differences across the five stakeholder groups. It was also suggested that non-direct stakeholders had a more favorable view of the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos and the sea lion, whereas direct stakeholder (the fishermen) saw it as an obstacle to their fisheries activities.

Reduced access to a marine resource will invariably impact local communities which reside nearby and utilise those resources. Social dimensions are recognised as crucial to the success of MPAs in meeting environmental goals, however, these dimensions are poorly understood. While much research is focused on developing countries, the majority of recent growth in MPA coverage is occurring in more economically developed settings. This research aims to address this gap by exploring the diversity of social impacts associated with an established MPA on the mid-coast of Western Australia. A range of extractive and non-extractive stakeholders were interviewed to identify the type of impacts experienced and how these are associated with attitudes towards the MPA. The results demonstrate there is a strong association between the nature of the impacts experienced by stakeholders and their attitudes. The social impacts are not distributed uniformly among stakeholders, with some groups of extractive users suffering the majority of the negative impacts and holding highly critical attitudes. The most common adverse impacts affect individual users' well-being including feelings of fear, stress, uncertainty and inequity, while impacts on fishing activities are limited. Those who reported broader scale community or environmental benefits held largely positive assessments of the MPA. Together these results illustrate the importance of identifying and mitigating the full spectrum of social impacts experienced, as opposed to a narrow focus on the disruption of fishing activities or socio-economic impacts alone.",22,2018,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.020,WOS:000438659600013,field,perception,2016,MPA,Jurien Bay,11,old,2005,moderate,5.5,30,823,large,NA,state,Australia,subtropical,Oceania,Indian Ocean,NA,,,mix,mix,fished,mix,,,tourism,assets,economic,income,neutral,no,economic benefits,paragraph 3.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2015, policy-makers withdrew three of four proposed Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in the Irish Sea from consideration for designation, due to concerns that they could significantly impact on the fisheries sector in Northern Ireland because they overlap with prawn fishing grounds in the Irish Sea. Although research has quantified the potential impact upon fishing vessels, none has quantified the impact upon the fisheries sector nor assessed the significance of this impact. Arguably, MCZ designations (or lack thereof) based on the 'significance' of an impact require robust underpinning evidence. This paper reports the findings of an Economic Impact Assessment, which has quantified the impact of a decline in landings upon the Northern Ireland fisheries sector and regional economy (data which is currently absent from the evidence base for the MCZ designation process in England). It finds that this will incur job losses in three fishing ports in Northern Ireland, but is unlikely to have a significant impact upon Northern Ireland's fisheries sector and regional economy in terms of jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA). In the worst case, the resulting economic impact is a decrease of 1.05-1.12 pound m/year GVA in Northern Ireland, which is 1.1% of the contribution of fishing and fish processing to the regional economy. Economic significance assessments, using this methodology, may be useful in supporting the evidence base underpinning MCZ designation and other aspects of marine planning.",4,2016,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.09.025,WOS:000390494100017,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,potential impacts of potential MPAs

However, many communities lack the resources to implement effective fisheries management. No-take marine reserves are a ubiquitous management intervention that provide conservation benefits and under certain circumstances can provide long-term fishery benefits as a result of larval and adult emigration from reserve boundaries. But, support for marine reserves by fishery participants is often limited due to short-term economic impacts resulting from foregone yields. In this study, we examine the timing and magnitude of economic impacts of marine reserves by utilizing a novel metric that discounts future economic benefits of enhanced productivity resulting from reserve protection. We ask under what circumstances long-term benefits outweigh short-term impacts of marine reserve implementation. We simulate fisheries for six species commonly caught in coastal environments and show that while conservation benefits accrue rapidly, more than a decade is often required to provide net fisheries benefits, even under circumstances favourable for reserves. We explore a suite of strategies for mitigating these short-term economic losses, including flexible reserve designs, loans and enhanced ex-vessel revenues. Results indicate that market-based incentives show promise to offset short-term economic losses. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and communicating likely outcomes from marine reserve implementation and the need to engage supply chain actors to incentivize marine conservation that minimizes impacts to fishermen.",17,2016,10.1111/faf.12153,WOS:000386938900002,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,incomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Reduced access to a marine resource will invariably impact local communities which reside nearby and utilise those resources. Social dimensions are recognised as crucial to the success of MPAs in meeting environmental goals, however, these dimensions are poorly understood. While much research is focused on developing countries, the majority of recent growth in MPA coverage is occurring in more economically developed settings. This research aims to address this gap by exploring the diversity of social impacts associated with an established MPA on the mid-coast of Western Australia. A range of extractive and non-extractive stakeholders were interviewed to identify the type of impacts experienced and how these are associated with attitudes towards the MPA. The results demonstrate there is a strong association between the nature of the impacts experienced by stakeholders and their attitudes. The social impacts are not distributed uniformly among stakeholders, with some groups of extractive users suffering the majority of the negative impacts and holding highly critical attitudes. The most common adverse impacts affect individual users' well-being including feelings of fear, stress, uncertainty and inequity, while impacts on fishing activities are limited. Those who reported broader scale community or environmental benefits held largely positive assessments of the MPA.

Recreational fishers were interviewed in a multiple-use MPA to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, and support towards the MPA six years after implementation. Almost two thirds of recreational fishers supported the MPA and had positive attitudes towards the concept of MPAs. This is a key result since a similar pre-implementation survey of recreational fishers found only 12% would support the creation of PSGLMP due to fears the MPA would negatively impact their fishing activities and ability to catch fish. However, there was a sub-group of fishers who opposed the MPA and were more inclined to have negative attitudes towards the rationale behind MPAs, despite the common perception that no-take zones were for fisheries management purposes and could increase fish stocks in the MPA. More experienced fishers were inclined to oppose the MPA, as well as fishers who believed management zones did not provide clear rules for activities, penalties for non-compliance were too harsh, or that no-take zones did not increase fish stocks. An important perceived threat to the MPA was from commercial fishing due to perceptions of over-exploitation and issues of non-compliance. In contrast, the majority of recreational fishers did not believe the collective actions of recreational fishers negatively impacted the marine environment and fish stocks, or the number of fish available for capture in the future. An improved understanding of these social aspects is important to target ongoing management in order to increase acceptance, success and long-term existence of MPAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reviews exclusion zones for commercial fishing, or 'recreational fishing areas' as a solution to the conflict between commercial and recreational fisheries. Recently designated recreational fishing areas in the state of Queensland, Australia are examined as a case-study. The goal of recreational fishing areas is to enhance recreational fishing and provide economic opportunities through charter fishing. However, recently designated recreational fishing areas in Queensland have not been thoroughly assessed for their social, economic and environmental impacts and they are not integrated within existing management frameworks for fisheries. The designation of recreational fishing areas is thus a shift away from evidence-based management in Queensland's fisheries and has likely occurred solely for political reasons - there are more voters in the recreational fishery than commercial fishery. In Queensland, excluding commercial fishing on its own is unlikely to result in long-term benefits to recreational fisheries because recreational harvest is a major component of fish harvest for some key species and there is no legislated limit to recreational harvest. Current political attention on recreational fishing areas provides an opportunity for fisheries managers, politicians, conservation groups and the public to discuss what is needed to manage sustainable coastal fisheries. In particular, recreational fishing areas need to be combined with efforts to enhance stewardship among recreational fishers if they are to be successful in the long-term. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become a widely used tool for marine conservation and fisheries management. In coastal areas, it has become clear that the success of MPAs, and the achievement of sustainable fishery production, requires a combination of effective management and conservation frameworks, maintenance of decent fisheries livelihoods, and a governance system that allows for effective participation of coastal communities, fishing people, and other ocean users in considering, designing and implementing MPAs. These ingredients are crucial to provide the social sustainability needed to achieve ecological sustainability, and in particular, to reconcile fisheries and marine conservation objectives, in light of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 2. Since its inception in 1962, the series of World Parks Congresses (WPC) has focused on protected areas, in both terrestrial and marine domains. The 2014 WPC in Sydney reinforced the apparent movement, started at the Durban WPC of 2003, towards recognition of social and economic issues related to MPAs, including the importance of food security and livelihoods, and the crucial nature of interactions between MPAs and fisheries. Many discussions at the 2014 WPC focused on these human dimensions of MPAs, and the need to incorporate them into MPA decision-making. 3. This article examines the process and outcomes of the 2014 WPC, with emphasis on the role of people (in particular, fishers) in marine conservation, and particularly in coastal MPAs. In doing so, the article examines the process of producing a Marine Statement at the end of the WPC, as a component of the final 'Promise of Sydney' declaration. That process led to a range of concerns including (i) issues over transparency and inclusiveness in the statement's development, and (ii) content issues focused on representation of the social and economic conclusions, and advocacy of a specific MPA target for no-take areas. The article focuses on potential strategies for moving constructively beyond the still existing tensions between environment-and people-focused conservation and development.

As fisheries managers, conservation biologists, and other invested groups move to develop new conservation measures to better protect sharks it will be important to understand the potential reactions (behaviors) local fishermen will have to new regulations. To determine the potential behaviors local artisanal fishermen in Costa Rica would have toward new conservation measures for sharks a structured survey (n=72) was distributed to several fishing communities along Costa Rica's Pacific coast. Overall, 89% of fishermen felt that protecting sharks was important with 97% stating a willingness to support shark conservation. However, support dropped to 67% if they would have to change some of their fishing practices. Almost all fishermen surveyed (93%) were in support of the formation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Although, if MPAs restricted their current fishing practices support dropped to between 6% and 65% depending on the restrictiveness of regulations implemented in the MPA. The majority (86%) of the fishermen surveyed also indicated they would be more likely to support new legislative measures to protect sharks if they were included in the decision making process. The results suggest that artisanal fishermen in Costa Rica are willing to protect sharks, but only if their current fishing practices are minimally impacted. It is therefore important that mangers work with these communities to develop management plans that will provide the best protection possible for sharks while also garnering local support to ensure continued compliance.

Yet, while corruption is said to obstruct the implementation of conservation policies, for instance as bribery may enable poaching in protected reserves, it is an underexplored area of research. This study investigates the effect of corruption, others' compliance behavior, and support for regulations on rule-violating intentions. In a between-subjects experiment, a sample of resource users active in South African small-scale fisheries (N = 201) answered questions about rule-violating intentions after reading one of four scenarios, each depicting a different situation of corruption among officials that enforce regulations and compliance behavior of other resource users. The results show that resource users are more likely to state rule-violating intentions when corruption among inspectors is widespread. Moreover, the study provides further theoretical insights into the process in which corruption perceptions deter the willingness to follow rules: there is an interaction effect with support for conservation regulations, suggesting that the effect of corruption is stronger among individuals who are less supportive of such rules. These findings lend further support for the proposition that to improve the effectiveness of conservation policy, more effort is needed to reduce bribery among government officials, such as rangers and inspectors that enforce natural resource regulations.",8,2016,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.04.011,WOS:000378665300006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,corruption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other social outcome (corruption),

We conducted a mixed-methods investigation of a contemporary migration of traditional fishers in western Madagascar, a country which has been expanding its protected area system through the establishment of both strict and multiple-use sites, and critically evaluate different models of marine protected area in light of our findings. Interviews with fishers in major destination areas revealed that most migrants come from southwest Madagascar, use non-motorised vessels, and principally target sharks and sea cucumbers. Drivers of the migration include both push and pull factors (i.e. declining resource availability in areas of origin and the continued availability of lucrative resources for export to China). Traditional fisher migrants cause limited social conflict with residents and a number of environmental problems in destination areas: however artisanal fishers with motorised vessels probably represent a greater threat to marine resources than migrants, due to their greater harvesting capacity. We suggest that multiple-use arrangements may, be more appropriate than strict protected areas in both source and destination areas, because they integrate the interests of migrants rather than marginalising them: however seascape-scale management provides the best approach for managing the threats and opportunities provided by the migration at the appropriate scale.

Although participation of local people is critical to the success of devolved commons management, few studies have empirically investigated how individuals' participation is related to socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales. Here, we evaluated how individual- and community-scale factors were related to levels of individual participation in management of community-based marine protected areas in Indonesia. In addressing this aim, we drew on multiple bodies of literature on human behaviour from economics and social science, including the social-ecological systems framework from the literature on common-pool resources, the theory of planned behaviour from social psychology, and public goods games from behavioural economics. We found three key factors related to level of participation of local people: subjective norms, structural elements of social capital, and nested institutions. There was also suggestive evidence that participation was related to people's cooperative behavioural disposition, which we elicited using a public goods game. These results point to the importance of considering socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales when examining individual behaviour. Further, our study highlights the need to consider multiscale mechanisms other than those designed to appeal to self interested concerns, such as regulations and material incentives, which are typically employed in devolved commons management to encourage participation. Increased understanding of the factors related to participation could facilitate better targeting of investments aimed at encouraging cooperative management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis builds on data collected over a ten-year period during three year-round surveys to appraise changes in recreational boating activities in coral ecosystems. Results show that the number of boaters has greatly increased, particularly so within MPAs during weekends and the warm season, when peaks in boat numbers have become more frequent. We also observed that the number of anchored boats has increased over the period. These changes may be resulting in biophysical impacts that could be detrimental to conservation objectives in MPAs.

Willingness to comply may depend on the values and perceptions of benefits and legitimacy of the restrictions. Consequently, we interviewed and evaluated the perceptions of fishing restrictions among similar to 2100 marine fisheries stakeholders (resource users and managers) in 102 fishing villages in Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania. We hypothesized that perceived benefits would decline and social inequity increase along a hypothesized gradient of increasing access restriction - ranging from minimum size of fish to fisheries closures. Managers did not recognize the hypothesized access restriction gradient, seeing most restrictions as beneficial, but with some nation-specific distinctions. Village-level responses of resource users varied by country, and overall perceived benefits of access restrictions increased with the wealth, education and membership in fishing organizations. In Kenya and Tanzania, some communities with views that differed greatly from managers were, in places, found near marine protected areas and they perceived more benefits accruing to the government than resource users for the strongest access restrictions. Madagascar and Mozambique fishing villages had low between-community variability, and their responses did not reflect the hypothesized restriction gradient or strong social disparity, which may reflect limited practical experience with restrictions. These results suggest that countries with stronger central governments contained villages with more between-community variability and perceived social disparity than weaker governments.

But climate change may place substantial stress on these sectors within this archipelago. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of two important climate change adaptation strategies in Fiji, natural resource management (NRM) and aquaculture, using a market fish supply-demand model. The model undertakes a comparative analysis of alternative fisheries development scenarios for 2035 and 2050, while taking account of the impact of climate change on the fisheries sector. The modeling and scenario analyses show that promoting aquaculture can help raise aggregate fish production, consumption, and trade. However, the required increases in aquaculture could be massive. While aqua culture development alone is unlikely to meet the growing excess demand for fish in Fiji, it will be an important component in adapting to the negative effects of climate change on capture fisheries. Various NRM strategies, such as marine protected areas (MPAs) and locally managed marine areas (LMMA5), are projected to have positive impacts in Fiji, expanding the stock and catch of fish. But current efforts on various NRM strategies are too small to have any meaningful impact to reverse the declining trends of coastal fisheries catch. Efforts would need to be greatly scaled-up to achieve significant production gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Similar to other developing countries and those in the Pacific, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more so because of their geographic location, socioeconomic conditions and political instability. Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector. Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices. Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish consumption is projected to grow due to population and income improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under climate change will require significant investments from the national governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One way in which fish stocks-and their habitats-can be protected is through the establishment of marine reserves, areas that are closed to fishing. Although the potential economic benefits of such reserves have been shown for single-owner fisheries, their implementation quickly becomes complicated when more than one noncooperating harvester is involved in fishery management, which is the case on the high seas. How domultiple self-interested actors distribute their fishing effort to maximize their individual economic gains in the presence of others? Here, we use a game theoretic model to compare the effort distributions of multiple noncooperating harvesters with the effort distributions in the benchmark sole owner and open access cases. In addition to comparing aggregate rent, stock size, and fishing effort, we focus on the occurrence, size, and location of marine reserves. We show that marine reserves are a component of many noncooperative Cournot-Nash equilibria. Furthermore, as the number of harvesters increases, (i) both total unfished area and the size of binding reserves (those that actually constrain behavior) may increase, although the latter eventually asymptotically decreases; (ii) total rents and stock size both decline; and (iii) aggregate effort used (i.e., employment) can either increase or decrease, perhaps nonmonotonically.",6,2016,10.1073/pnas.1518509113,WOS:000373354000038,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

Larval export from reserves is argued to help compensate for the loss of fishable habitat; however, previous modeling studies have focused on long-term equilibrium outcomes. We examined the transient consequences of reserve establishment for fished metapopulations, considering both a well-mixed larval pool and a spatially explicit model based on a coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation. When fishing pressure was reallocated relative to the area protected, yields decreased initially, then recovered, and ultimately exceeded pre-reserve levels. However, recovery time was on the order of several years to decades. If fishing pressure intensified to maintain pre-reserve yields, reserves were sometimes unable to support the increased mortality and the metapopulation collapsed. This was more likely when reserves were small, or located peripherally within the metapopulation.

When such tourism development entails place-based management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict between conservation and development as well as for increasing community participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism development are essential for involving local communities. Local communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope with future changes by conducting a social ecological system (SES) analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different experiences in social ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken to assess whether increased availability of, and access to, fish improves a) household food security and b) individual nutritional status. Results: A total of 29 studies were reviewed. Fourteen studies identified fish as the primary food source for Pacific Islanders and five studies reported fish/seafood as the primary source of dietary protein. Fish consumption varied by cultural sub-region and Pacific Island countries and territories. Fish consumption and nutritional status was addressed in nine studies, reporting moderate iodine deficiency in Vanuatu where only 30 % of participants consumed mostly fresh fish. Similarly, the degree to which Pacific Islanders depended on fishing for household income and livelihood varied between and within PICTs. For more economically developed countries, household income was derived increasingly from salaried work and dependency on fishing activities has been declining. Conclusions: Fishing remains a major contributor to food security in PICTs, through subsistence production and income generation. However, there is a paucity of research aimed at assessing how maintaining and/or improving fish consumption benefits the diets and health of Pacific Islanders as they contend with the ongoing nutrition transition that is characterised by an increasing demand for packaged imported foods, such as canned meats, instant noodles, cereals, rice, and sugar-sweetened beverages, with subsequent decreased consumption of locally-produced plants and animals.",55,2016,10.1186/s12889-016-2953-9,WOS:000372824600002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

Participants sorted a set of statements (n=42) into a forced-choice frequency distribution and centroid analysis revealed three factors for interpretation: (1) 'pro-conservation', characterised by views that conservation should be prioritised over commercial and economic interests; (2) 'pro-fisheries' who saw fishing as the priority and expressed concerns over the uncertainty of management measures and the number of planned MPAs; and (3) 'win-win' who felt that the current approach to marine management using MPAs would allow both fisheries and conservation goals to be met. Despite some differences in opinion, social acceptability of MPAs was identified across all three discourses, but was limited by the knock-on effects of the exclusion of stakeholders from the implementation of MPAs and the development of management measures. This resulted in disenfranchisement and uncertainty over the future of their activities. The results suggest that social acceptability of MPAs is generated by effective and ongoing stakeholder engagement, transparency and honesty relating to the costs and benefits of designations and a certainty that once sites are in place the resources exist for their effective management. Understanding social acceptability will guide adaptive management and increase the chances of MPA success and the meeting of global targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Visitor activities, such as trampling, rock turning, and collecting, can harm rocky shore flora and fauna, including reducing their abundances, diversity, and reproductive output, shifting their size/age structure, and altering normal ecosystem functioning. Research characterizing human use of these ecosystems in 1995-96 at 8 sites in Orange County, California, revealed that levels of visitation and collecting were high at some sites, despite collecting being prohibited in these Marine Protected Areas, and that these behaviors have adversely affected some organisms. Over the decade following, the Orange County Marine Protected Area Council (OCMPAC), a local conservation collaborative, implemented education, outreach, and enforcement strategies to reduce the harmful activities of visitors. To determine whether human visitation and behaviors have changed over the last two decades, during a period of increased management associated with OCMPAC efforts, we compared human use patterns between 1995-96 and 2013-14. Comparisons revealed a decrease in the frequency of detrimental activities, such as collecting and fishing, possibly due to management strategies. However, increases in visitation frequency over time, which often includes the detrimental impacts of trampling on organisms, highlights that some activities are increasing and will remain difficult to manage in the future. Comparisons of the size structures of Lottia gigantea, an exploited limpet herbivore, over the same time period, reveal an increase in size, possibly indicative of reduced collecting pressure, potentially as a result of OCMPAC management. While some adaptive management is necessary to improve enacted management strategies, it is recommended that the conservation model set by OCMPAC be introduced to other coastal regions exhibiting high levels of human visitation in order to better manage rocky intertidal ecosystems.

The framework quantifies the level of conflict that a reserve designation might cause in the fishing sector due to displacement and the opportunities to offset the conflict through fisher spatial mobility (i.e., ability of fishers to fish elsewhere). We also considered how the outputs of the framework can be used to identify targeted management interventions for each fishery. We applied the method in Honduras, where the largest marine protected area in Central America is being placed, for which spatial data on fishing effort were available for 6 fisheries over 3 years. The proposed closure had a greater negative impact on the shrimp and lobster scuba fisheries, which concentrated respectively 28% and 18% of their effort inside the reserve. These fisheries could not accommodate the displacement within existing fishing grounds. Both would be forced to stretch into new fishing grounds, which are available but are of unknown quality. These stakeholders will likely require compensation to offset costly exploratory fishing or to travel to fishing grounds farther away from port.",12,2016,10.1111/cobi.12573,WOS:000368938000018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Several communities in Kenya have embraced CBM and have set aside or closed previously fished areas to enhance recovery of fisheries and biodiversity. These community fisheries closures (locally called tengefu), despite being degraded, may recover to finfish abundances and biodiversity levels similar to established MPAs or above thresholds for maintaining some ecological services.

In large, heterogeneous systems, hierarchical institutional regimes may be efficient, but effective management outcomes are dependent on stakeholder support. This support is shaped by perceptions of legitimacy, which risks being undermined where resource users are not engaged in decision-making. Although legitimacy is demonstrably critical for effective governance, less is known about the factors contributing to stakeholders' perceptions of legitimacy or how these perceptions are socially differentiated. We quantitatively assessed stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy (indicated by support for rules) and their contributory factors among 307 commercial fishers and tourism operators in Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Legitimacy was most strongly associated with trust in information from governing bodies, followed by confidence in institutional performance and the equity of management outcomes. Legitimacy differed both within and among resource user groups, which emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of commonly defined stakeholder groups. Overall, tourism operators perceived higher legitimacy than did commercial fishers, which was associated with higher trust in information from management agencies. For fishers, higher levels of trust were associated with: (1) engagement in fisheries that had high subsector cohesion and positive previous experiences of interactions with governing bodies; (2) location in areas with greater proximity to sources of knowledge, resources, and decision-making; and (3) engagement in a Reef Guardian program. These findings highlight the necessity of strategies and processes to build trust among all user groups in large social-ecological systems such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Furthermore, the social differentiation of perceptions that were observed within user groups underscores the importance of targeted strategies to engage groups that may not be heard through traditional governance channels.",36,2016,10.5751/ES-08542-210318,WOS:000385720400012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,confidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"other social outcome (trust, confidence)",

Despite this, current recommendations on ideal MPA size and spacing vary widely, and data are lacking on how these constraints might influence the overall spatial characteristics, socio-economic impacts, and connectivity of the resultant MPA networks. To address this problem, we tested the impact of applying different MPA size constraints in English waters. We used the Marxan spatial prioritization software to identify a network of MPAs that met conservation feature targets, whilst minimizing impacts on fisheries; modified the Marxan outputs with the MinPatch software to ensure each MPA met a minimum size; and used existing data on the dispersal distances of a range of species found in English waters to investigate the likely impacts of such spatial constraints on the region's biodiversity. Increasing MPA size had little effect on total network area or the location of priority areas, but as MPA size increased, fishing opportunity cost to stakeholders increased. In addition, as MPA size increased, the number of closely connected sets of MPAs in networks and the average distance between neighboring MPAs decreased, which consequently increased the proportion of the planning region that was isolated from all MPAs. These results suggest networks containing large MPAs would be more viable for the majority of the region's species that have small dispersal distances, but dispersal between MPA sets and spill-over of individuals into unprotected areas would be reduced. These findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of applying different MPA size constraints because there are clear trade-offs that result from the interaction of size, number, and distribution of MPAs in a network.",14,2015,10.1111/cobi.12571,WOS:000368334800014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

One is located in a community with a reef struggling to recover from destructive fishing, the other in a community that has experienced a remarkable recovery. Using mixed methods, long-form interviews, and surveys of reef tourism stakeholders, this uses institutional characteristics to predict reef quality. Certain institutional components hypothesized to predict reef quality did not; these include universal membership requirements for reef stakeholders, stakeholder familiarity with leadership and hierarchies, and transparent decision-making and implementation of management policy. This means that one size fits all prescriptions for local reef management institutions should be viewed with caution. Instead, the success of management institutions may depend upon both the path toward economic development, access to technology that facilitates coral recovery, and communication of conservation strategies to tourist visitors.

Marine protected areas are a solution to protect ESs, such as fish stocks, although this could potentially lead to conflicts with fisheries and tourism. We investigated how fisheries and tourism in the SE Brazil interact with conservation, evaluating their potential for synergistic interactions. We sampled fish landings (n=823) in two villages and performed interviews with fishers and middlemen regarding fisheries and tourism, besides using secondary information regarding the MPA effectiveness. Fish production was high outside the MPA (9.25 t/day), and could be profitable, resulting in reduced fishing pressure, but a faulty market chain prevents this. Fishers involved with coastal tourism had better incomes than those who engaged in only fisheries. Tourism in permitted areas outside the MPA could benefit both fisheries and biodiversity conservation by reducing the time fishers allocate to fishing and by attracting visitors for wildlife viewing. Nonconflicting uses of ESs can be achieved by assuring that the local poor population benefits from more than one ES in a sustainable way, but that requires alternatives such as adding value to ESs and paying for environmental services.

In Fiji, these are locally managed and, where enforced, have significantly higher coral cover, higher fish biomass, and lower seaweed cover than the adjacent unprotected reefs (non-MPAs). We investigated how the isotopic signatures of a common mid-level consumer, Epinephelus merra, differed among 3 small (0.5 to 0.8 km(2)) MPAs versus adjacent unprotected reefs. Isotopic ratios suggested that the fish in the MPAs fed higher in the food chain than those in the adjacent non-MPAs, despite being slightly smaller. Calculations using a brown alga as representative of the basal level of the food chain estimate this difference to be about half a trophic level. Thus, the isotopic ratio of a mid-level consumer can be noticeably altered over scales of only a few hundred meters. This may result from more complete food webs and hence greater prey choice and availability in the MPAs and implies that MPAs affect not only species' abundance and diversity but also diet composition and trophic biology of member individuals. Our findings suggest that E. merra exhibits considerable site fidelity in its feeding biology and thus provides a localized isotopic signal of its reef of residence. If the isotopic signal of this mid-level carnivore is reflective of the composition of the food web beneath it, the signal might provide an easily obtained indication of reef conditions in that area.",14,2015,10.3354/meps11487,WOS:000365698900019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanims,

Incorporating noise into spatial planning (e.g., critical habitat designation or marine protected areas) may improve ecological integrity and promote ecological resilience to withstand additional stressors. Previous work identified areas with high ship noise requiring mitigation. This study introduces the concept of opportunity sites important habitats that experience low ship noise. Working with existing patterns in ocean noise and animal distribution will facilitate conservation gains while minimizing societal costs, by identifying opportunities to protect important wildlife habitats that happen to be quiet.

Despite major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable yield (MSY) under conventional quota management if reserves provide protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net fishery benefit of MRs is lost when gains in fecundity of old, large individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic overfishing.",18,2015,10.1098/rstb.2014.0276,WOS:000362720200008,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,food security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

If the quota management system is not fully delineated (e.g. harvest rights assigned to particular areas) then fishers will compete with each other and overexploit parts of the fishery where or when the quota unit value is highest (i.e. fishing costs low and/or market price high), leading to economic rent dissipation. This study used experimental economics to assess the effectiveness of fishery temporal closures and income-sharing fishery cooperatives in resolving assignment problems across three different fisheries with varying levels of fisher heterogeneity (i.e. numbers of quota owners and lease quota fishers). While most fisheries were successful in reducing economic rent dissipation under the fishery closure management structure relative to their baseline(s), fisheries characterized by a greater number of lease quota fishers were less effective. This was due to the differential values that lease quota fishers place on the resource relative to quota owners, due to having insecurity of tenure and diminished wealth in having to bid for a quota package and pay for it using their revenue from fishing. Conversely, income-sharing fishery cooperatives were equally successful across all three fisheries in reducing assignment problems relative to their baseline(s). This was because income-sharing created an incentive to coordinate fishing effort, particularly among heterogeneous groups. While requiring further exposition in the field, these experimental results represent a first step in identifying management institutions that may assist fishers under quota management to resolve assignment problems in a dynamic environment.",6,2015,10.1093/icesjms/fsv148,WOS:000368252700013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved area,

Using as a case study the design of a system of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) in Kubulau, Fiji, we assessed how these aspects affected the configuration of no-take MPAs in terms of trade-offs between biodiversity objectives, fisheries objectives, and equity in catch losses among fisher stakeholder groups. The achievement of fisheries objectives and equity tended to trade-off concavely with increasing biodiversity objectives, indicating that it is possible to achieve low to mid-range biodiversity objectives with relatively small losses to fisheries and equity. Importantly, the extent of trade-offs depended on the method used to incorporate socioeconomic data and was least severe when objectives were set for each fisher stakeholder group explicitly.

Here, we derived a size-based, spatially explicit, stochastic demographic model to explore how different spatial configurations of MR networks can affect abundance and commercial yield of the green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), taking as a reference case the abalone fishery of Isla Natividad in Baja California Sur (Mexico). Our analysis suggests that a network of MRs can have a positive effect on abalone population abundance and a slightly negative effect on fishery output with respect to traditional maximum sustainable yield (MSY; i.e., with no reserves). Simulations show that maximum catches achievable with MRs are, under the best configuration, similar to 2%-14% lower than traditional MSY depending on the total fraction of the fishing grounds protected. In the case of overexploitation, long-term yields can increase following the implementation of MRs. In addition, in the presence of MRs, abundances and yields are much less sensitive to systematic errors in the enforcement of the optimal harvesting rate compared with situations in which MRs are not present. Given the limited dispersal ability of the species, the best outcomes in terms of fishery output would be achieved with very small reserves-around 100 m wide-so to maximize larval export in the fishable areas. Our results indicate appropriately designed MR networks are an effective strategy for meeting both conservation and economic goals under uncertainty. While the size of the existing reserves in Isla Natividad seems adequate to protect the abalone stock, smaller reserves could maximize fishery benefits, although this poses challenges for enforcement.",17,2015,10.1139/cjfas-2013-0623,WOS:000361828400007,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

However, quantitative evaluations of input control are generally difficult, because it is unclear how much human impacts can actually be reduced by the control. We present a model framework to quantify the effectiveness of input control using day closures to reduce actual fishing impact by considering the observed fishery dynamics. The model framework was applied to the management of the Pacific stock of the chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) fishery, in which fishing was suspended for one day following any day when the total mackerel catch exceeded a threshold level. We evaluated the management measure according to the following steps: (1) we fitted the daily observed catch and fishing effort data to a generalized linear model (GLM) or generalized autoregressive state-space model (GASSM), (2) we conducted population dynamics simulations based on annual catches randomly generated from the parameters estimated in the first step, (3) we quantified the effectiveness of day closures by comparing the results of two simulation scenarios with and without day closures, and (4) we conducted additional simulations based on different sets of explanatory variables and statistical models (sensitivity analysis). In the first step, we found that the GASSM explained the observed data far better than the simple GLM. The model parameterized with the estimates from the GASSM demonstrated that the day closures implemented from 2004 to 2009 would have decreased exploitation fractions by; similar to 10% every year and increased the 2009 stock biomass by 37-46% (median), relative to the values without day closures. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the effectiveness of day closures was particularly influenced by autoregressive processes in the fishery data and by positive relationships between fishing effort and total biomass. Those results indicated the importance of human behavioral dynamics under input control in quantifying the conservation benefit of natural resource management and the applicability of our model framework to the evaluation of the input controls that are actually implemented.",12,2015,10.1890/14-1216.1,WOS:000360813100011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,framework,

Over the past 12 years, I evaluated the effects of gear regulation and fisheries closures on per person and per area incomes from fishing in coral reefs of Kenya. In two of my study areas, the use of small-meshed beach seines was stopped after 6 years; one of these areas was next to a fishery closure. In my third study area, fishing was unregulated. Fishing yields on per capita daily wet weight basis were 20% higher after seine-net fishing was stopped. The per person daily fishing income adjacent to the closed areas was 14 and 22% higher than the fishing income at areas with only gear restrictions before and after the seine-net restriction, respectively. Incomes differed because larger fish were captured next to the closed area and the price per weight (kilograms) increased as fish size increased and because catches adjacent to the closure contained fish species of higher market value. Per capita incomes were 41 and 135% higher for those who fished in gear-restricted areas and near-closed areas, respectively, compared with those who fished areas with no restrictions. On a per unit area basis (square kilometers), differences in fishing income among the three areas were not large because fishing effort increased as the number of restrictions decreased. Changes in catch were, however, larger and often in the opposite direction expected from changes in effort alone. For example, effort declined 21% but nominal profits per square kilometer (not accounting for inflation) increased 29% near the area with gear restrictions.

Closures covered similar to 20% of a village's fished area and lasted 2-7 months. Fishery Catches from Each Closed Site Octopus landings and catch per unit effort (CPUE) significantly increased in the 30 days following a closure's reopening, relative to the 30 days before a closure (landings: +718%, p<0.0001; CPUE: +87%, p<0.0001; n = 36). Open-access control sites showed no before/after change when they occurred independently of other management (no ban, n = 17/36). On the other hand, open-access control sites showed modest catch increases when they extended a 6-week seasonal fishery shutdown (ban, n = 19/36). The seasonal fishery shutdown affects the entire region, so confound all potential control sites. Fishery Income in Implementing Villages In villages implementing a closure, octopus fishery income doubled in the 30 days after a closure, relative to 30 days before (+132%, p<0.001, n = 28). Control villages not implementing a closure showed no increase in income after no ban closures and modest increases after ban closures. Villages did not show a significant decline in income during closure events. Net Economic Benefits from Each Closed Site Landings in closure sites generated more revenue than simulated landings assuming continued open-access fishing at that site (27/36 show positive net earnings; mean +$305/closure; mean +57.7% monthly). Benefits accrued faster than local fishers' time preferences during 17-27 of the 36 closures. High reported rates of illegal fishing during closures correlated with poor economic performance.

Prior to the MPAs enclosing 17% of the islands' lobster fishing grounds, 25 commercial lobster fishermen caught 50% of the regional annual landings from the Channel Islands. To best manage MPAs and affected fisheries we ask a critical question: Where did the fishermen go? Spillover theory emerging from models of MPAs and adjacent fisheries suggests displaced fishermen will concentrate their effort along MPA borders; a phenomenon called fishing the line. These models do not consider habitat-specific fishing effort, habitat heterogeneity, nor fixed-gear fisheries such as lobster where traps are set, soaked for 1 to 3 nights, pulled and re-set. With fixed-gear fishing, space is marked or occupied, and reduces the possibility of another fisherman to fish that space. Lobster trap fisheries are notoriously territorial as a result. Lobster fisheries therefore stand to experience a skewed impact based on a priori territorial distributions and habitat quality. We use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map 10 years (5 before reserves and 5 after) of fishery-dependent logbook data assisted with fishery interviews to test if commercial lobster fishermen aggregated fishing effort at MPA borders as an adaptive fishing strategy. We found that fishermen around the Channel Islands MPAs did not concentrate effort at MPA boundaries but instead the proportion of total traps pulled in close proximity (within 1 km of reserve borders) to MPAs declined from 10% to 5%. Chi(2) analysis found a significant decrease in the proportion of a season's traps pulled in areas near MPA borders (n = 157,071; p < .001). T test analysis testing the difference in CPUE between areas far from MPAs and areas adjacent to MPA borders showed a significant reduction in the difference between CPUE following MPA designation (n = 50,206; p < .001).

Indeed, little work has been done to advance the frameworks and methods needed to assess, measure, and communicate the potential negative socioeconomic impact of MPAs and incorporate this information in MPA planning and management efforts. To address this gap, we test a vulnerability assessment termed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) that is designed to measure the relative potential impact a proposed MPA network may have upon fisherman livelihoods. To test the LVI, specifically we ask, how does the vulnerability of fishermen to the impact of MPAs differ across place? We explore this question through two core areas of inquiry surrounding the study of vulnerability assessments: 1) Ranking and comparing vulnerability and 2) Explaining attributes of vulnerability. Through this study we demonstrate how the historical and current conditions fishermen experience in a given place shape vulnerability levels in various ways. Variability in the attributes of a particular place such as weather conditions, the size of fishing areas, availability of alternative fisheries, and changes in kelp cover contribute inherently as measures of vulnerability but they also shape fishermen perceptions of what are important measures of vulnerability. Secondly, counter to existing notions, the use of weights in vulnerability assessments may not significantly impact vulnerability scores and ranking. Together these findings emphasize the need to test vulnerability assessments against actual experienced impact or harm across geographies and groups of fishermen towards an informed refinement of vulnerability assessments. We emphasize that the particularities of place are critical to understand, to appropriately assess and thus to effectively mitigate vulnerability in order to promote the future well being of fisherman livelihoods.

As a result, it is important to examine the socioeconomic consequences of MPAs and how they may affect nearby communities. This study explores social and equity issues surrounding the designation of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, an MPA that includes protections around the three most northern islands in the US territory of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI). We gathered oral history interviews with 40 individuals from CMNI and Guam who had connections to the waters in the newly-designated MPA and reviewed key documents in order to (1) document historical and current use of the waters in the MPA and (2) consider the implications that proposed fishing regulations in the MPA may have for the local communities. Our study documented 129 trips to visit the waters in the MPA in living memory. We found that due to distance, trips to the MPA waters were rare but culturally significant events that provided residents from CNMI and Guam with connections to their indigenous roots. Regulation of fishing in the new MPA has the potential to directly and indirectly restrict local access to these culturally important waters. This research highlights the importance of better collaboration with local partners and better consideration of social and equity concerns in the siting and regulation of MPAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

M.; Dornelas, Maria",Spillover Effects of a Community-Managed Marine Reserve,PLOS ONE,,"The value of no-take marine reserves as fisheries-management tools is controversial, particularly in high-poverty areas where human populations depend heavily on fish as a source of protein. Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Spillover can contribute to poverty alleviation, although its effect is modulated by the number of fishermen and fishing intensity. In this study, we quantify the effects of a community-managed marine reserve in a high poverty area of Northern Mozambique. For this purpose, underwater visual censuses of reef fish were undertaken at three different times: 3 years before (2003), at the time of establishment (2006) and 6 years after the marine reserve establishment (2012). The survey locations were chosen inside, outside and on the border of the marine reserve. Benthic cover composition was quantified at the same sites in 2006 and 2012. After the reserve establishment, fish sizes were also estimated. Regression tree models show that the distance from the border and the time after reserve establishment were the variables with the strongest effect on fish abundance. The extent and direction of the spillover depends on trophic group and fish size. Poisson Generalized Linear Models show that, prior to the reserve establishment, the survey sites did not differ but, after 6 years, the abundance of all fish inside the reserve has increased and caused spillover of herbivorous fish. Spillover was detected 1 km beyond the limit of the reserve for small herbivorous fishes. Six years after the establishment of a community-managed reserve, the fish assemblages have changed dramatically inside the reserve, and spillover is benefitting fish assemblages outside the reserve.",20,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0111774,WOS:000353713100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms (spillover),

Four sets of models demonstrated country characteristics that correlate with higher protection levels within marine protected areas (MPAs). Certain contextual factors - economic dependence on the marine environment, efforts at terrestrial conservation and greater human impact - were found to be significantly associated with higher PLs among the northern littoral countries of the Mediterranean.

Driven by overarching global and European policies and national legislations, current systematic conservation planning in the UK and France requires an ecosystem approach that takes into account not only nature but also the human activities that take place in an area. Here, we identified a set of 64 socioeconomic variables potentially relevant for marine and coastal stakeholders in a European context and a comprehensive set of 20 marine and coastal stakeholder categories. Ninety national organisations in the UK and France belonging to those categories and potentially affected by/interested in the designation of multiple-use MPAs were identified and surveyed. Results show that environmental NGOs, research centres, local councils, managing agencies and statutory nature conservation bodies perceived that they are positively affected by these MPAs, whereas fishers' organisations, shipping and aggregate industrial organisations and recreational organisations perceived to be chiefly negatively affected by MPAs. On average, the ecological effects of multiple-use MPAs are perceived as 'largely positive', though 30% of respondents did not perceive any positive ecological effects from these MPAs. The social, economic and cultural effects of such MPAs are perceived as 'moderately positive'. Most respondents perceived broad range (>10 km) and permanent ecological, social, economic and cultural effects from multiple-use MPA designation suggesting high societal expectations towards these areas. However, only five variables were perceived to vary in intensity after the designation of multiple-use MPAs: 'research', 'environmental performance by citizens, businesses and towns', 'number of green businesses', 'tourism' and 'economic activities'. The most important 'social' variables for stakeholder organisations referred to local populations' engagement with the MPA, tourism and research. The most important 'economic' variables were linked to fishing, shipping and aquaculture activities. These variables highlight relevant topics to be considered in MPA planning, designation and management processes, especially in the UK and France. There were statistically significant differences in the ratings of socioeconomic variables between many organisations belonging to the same intuitive stakeholder categories, suggesting the importance of including as wide a range of stakeholder organisations as feasible in MPA socioeconomic-related processes. Our methods and findings can help to inform and streamline ongoing and future participatory MPA planning, management and monitoring processes in Europe and in other regions with similar socioeconomic characteristics.

We compared the two communities in terms of catch composition, fishing effort, ex-vessel prices and revenues, seasonal patterns in fishing activities in relation to the reproductive seasons of target species, and spatial patterns of fishing in relation to managed zones within the reserve. The top four species (Cynoscion othonopterus, Micropogonias megalops, Scomberomorus concolor, Litopenaeus stylirostris) in terms of relative effort, catch, and revenues were the same for both communities but overall fisheries production, effort, and revenues were higher in GSC than SF for these species. Fishing activities in GSC followed a predictable annual cycle that began with L stylirostris and were followed sequentially by the harvesting of C. othonopterus, M. megalops, and S. concolor during their respective spawning seasons, which were associated with seasonal variations in ex-vessel prices. Conversely, catch and revenues in SF were more diversified, less dependent on those four species, less seasonal, and did not show seasonal variations in prices. Interactions between fisheries and managed zones also differed such that SF interacted mainly with the southwest portion of the vaquita (Phocoena sinus) refuge, whereas GSC fished over a larger area and interacted mainly with the northeast portion of the vaquita refuge and the no-take zone. Our results indicate the two communities differ markedly in their socio-economic dependence on fisheries, their spatio-temporal patterns of fishing, their use of and impacts on species, coastal ecosystems and managed areas, and how different regulations may affect livelihoods. Regional management and conservation efforts should account for these differences to ensure the protection of endangered species and to sustain ecosystem services that maintain livelihoods and healthy coastal ecosystems. This study provides further evidence of the ability of collaborative research between scientists and fishers to produce robust and fine-scale fisheries and biological information that improves the collective knowledge and management of small-scale fisheries within marine protected areas.

The purpose of this paper is to show how a coastal governance practice can emerge and stabilize, such that actors with disparate knowledge systems collaborate towards the shared goal of sustainable resource use. We analyze this stabilization in terms of the coproduction of knowledge and policy. This paper is empirically informed by a case study on the transition towards a sustainable mussel fishery in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Our study illuminates the difficulties of underpinning a coastal governance practice with scientific research, since the relevance, quality, and results of research are interpreted differently from the perspectives of resource users and conservationists. Furthermore, our analysis shows that such a governance practice can stabilize through a combination of rule negotiation, legal, societal, and political pressure, along with collaborative knowledge creation. Based on our analysis, we identify several aspects of collaborative knowledge creation that enable the formation of a shared knowledge base for governance in a context of controversy. These include the shared ownership of research, knowledge creation as an integral part of governance, a focus on data and basic facts, and the close involvement of trusted experts. The findings of this study suggest that a controversial setting strongly structures knowledge creation, while at the same time knowledge creation enables coastal governance as a way of dealing with conflicts.

Local MPAs have been established to protect inter-tidal mudflats and shore users from bait collection which is a contentious worldwide issue. Video cameras monitored activity and confirmed if collectors adhered to the rules at three UK sites with different MPA systems. An educational approach (a voluntary code leaflet) was also assessed through stakeholder discussion and observation. Fareham Creek and Dell Quay supported a considerable number of collectors with none observed at Pagham Harbour. At Fareham Creek bait dug areas were evident in discrete patches in unprotected and protected areas, but observed collectors mainly used the latter. The failure to exclude collectors is due to the lack of enforcement. At Dell Quay virtually all dug areas were outside protected areas and was confirmed by the camera footage. Success is attributed to regular on-the-ground 'unofficial' enforcement by the managing NGO. Of the retailers, 75% had heard of the code and the majority stated they followed it. However, none of the 26 collectors observed followed a key rule (e.g. backfilling holes). Local marine conservation is relatively cheap and can be effective, but only if: management matches the actual pressure; scientific evaluation for all components (including education) is integrated from the beginning; adequate site enforcement is included; education methods are active, two-way and sustained.

As the world moves slowly towards the establishment of a global network of MPAs, it is increasingly apparent that a greater understanding of social responses to MPAs is required, given they are often met with resistance from local communities. A series of in-depth, semi structured interviews were conducted across coastal users in New South Wales, Australia, including surfers, recreational fishers, professional fishers, spearfishers, walkers, divers, snorkellers, kayakers and other community members. The research identified the values, images and principles at work amongst coastal users to determine the dominant 'cultural models' within the community and how these models influenced attitudes towards MPAs. This research indicates that traditional consultation models may not be sufficient to address the full spectrum of community needs, and in fact suggests the need to reconceive the make -up of 'the community' itself. In the context of MPA planning 'the community' is not an amalgamation of a range of homogenous stakeholder groups but instead a diverse and complex mix of identities and value systems which are not confined to particular interest groups. Incorporating consideration of the diverse range of values, images and principles found within and across stakeholder groups will require new and innovative approaches to participation and management.

Drawing on information gathered from 70 oral histories, over 250 key informant interviews and 28 focus groups, the paper examines key social impacts respondents attribute to MPAs and their establishment and ongoing management. Significant negative impacts reported include the weakening of local governance rights and processes, in particular the lack of effective mechanisms for local community participation in decision making. The loss of tenure rights and access to resources amongst already marginalised communities has contributed to food insecurity, less exchange of food and less household income. The MPAs investigated have impacted on culture, way of life and sense of place. Yet, despite government commitments to several international policy instruments relevant to MPAs and national laws legislating redress, social issues associated with MPAs have been largely overlooked. Findings from this research demonstrate that the failure to address historical impacts, as well as social hardships and inequities still being experienced, undermine the legitimacy of MPAs and frustrate the achievement of objectives and plans to increase the marine space under protection.

Local resistance has slowed international progress towards a global network of MPAs. The causes of local resistance and limited social acceptability are poorly known, which constrains the development of new planning paradigms that could address these issues. Two case studies in New South Wales, Australia determined the factors that influenced community attitudes towards MPAs. The Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP) and Batemans Marine Park (BMP) underwent virtually identical and concurrent planning processes, however resistance to the BMP was more intense and sustained. Differences in the demographics, history, local media coverage and social impacts of each marine park contributed to these different community responses. The BMP demonstrated the 'perfect storm' of opposition triggers - a community struggling in the transition away from a primary production economy, a highly politicised media dominated by powerful elites with ideological objections to the park, and social impacts sufficiently profound to motivate local citizens to support an active campaign against the park. These impacts included loss of access, identity and increased competition for resources. This research points to the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the social, cultural and political landscape of the communities in which MPAs are proposed and a rethink of planning processes to better incorporate community objectives and knowledge.

Moreover, catch rates used as a proxy of stock abundance in stock assessment, are believed to decline much more slowly than the actual stock abundance. Thus, a quota-based system may not be sufficient to sustain the stock. A bio-economic simulation and optimisation model was used to explore how various area closures in combination with the quota-system affect levels of by-catch, net profit of individual fleet segments from different ports, and stock development in that fishery. Tested area closures differed in duration, size and location relative to major ports and to seasonal movement patterns of species. These closures were tested under variable recruitment. Area closures that were covering the seasonal migration route of saithe revealed almost two times greater increases in spawning stock biomass than closures that were not covering the migration route. Even area closures where a high dispersal rate of individuals was assumed resulted in increased spawning stock biomass of saithe. Benefits of the tested area closures were distributed heterogeneously among individual fleet segments. Increases of saithe stock size were offset by increases in cod by-catch. The location of an area closure relative to the home port of fleet segments decided if steaming costs increased and catches decreased. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, it is necessary to know the perception and behavior of resource users in these areas in relation to the management process. This study addressed the perception of different groups of fishermen in three MPAs that allow sustainable use of resources on the Brazilian northeastern coast. The perception analysis was based on four aspects; biodiversity conservation, flexibility and adaptability of fishermen, participation in management and opinions about the MPA. The interviewed fishermen (n=100) were classified into natives or immigrants, >= than 40 years old or <40, predominant use of selective or nonselective fishing gear and part or full time fishermen. The results showed that younger fishermen and the ones who use selective fishing gear presented a more conservation prone perception; nonselective fishermen and part-time fishermen were more flexible and adaptable to changes; and younger fishermen tended to agree more with the establishment of the MPAs. Taking these differences in perceptions among fishermen into account could serve as a basis for improvements in the management and conservation of fishing resources, besides helping predict possible future behavior due to changes in management policies.

It is thought to be especially crucial for the success of small MPAs. Whilst the importance of community support has been highlighted in a number of studies, it has not yet been clearly defined or explicitly studied. Questionnaires were carried out (N=166) at three different villages within the Visayas region of the Philippines to determine individuals' support towards adjacent MPAs and individual characteristics that have previously been hypothesised to influence support. Multiple regressions analysis determined: (1) Which individual-level factors predict attitude towards MPAs, (2) whether attitudes of individuals are related to actions that benefit the adjacent MPA and (3) whether individual or community-level factors are better predictors of individual support for local community-based MPAs. Knowledge of MPA objectives, perceived participation in decision making, trust towards other fishers and differences between villages all significantly predicted attitudes towards MPAs. Weak relationships were found between attitudes and certain MPA related actions due to contextual factors. Village was not the only significant predictor of both attitudes and MPA related actions; individual characteristics irrespective of differences between villages, were also important in predicting support for the MPA. This study highlights the importance in distinguishing between attitudes and actions of individuals and suggests specific individual characteristics can be vital in influencing support towards MPAs.

A southern Europe perspective,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,,"This paper addresses the problem of measuring the local economic impact of marine protected areas (MPAs). It relies on a broad socio-economic field survey covering 12 case studies in southern Europe, and focusing on two major uses of MPA ecosystem services: fishing and scuba-diving. The impact of these uses on the local economic system is expressed in terms of incomes and jobs, and the methodology relies on a distinction between users transforming ecosystem services into commodities, and users consuming ecosystem services for recreational purposes. Assessment results show a variety of situations, from MPAs where commercial fishing is the major economic stake, to MPAs where recreational activities have a dominant economic rote. However, available information concerning the number of recreational users and visitors, on one side, and the number and characteristics of commercial fishing boats, on the other side, suggest that the second situation is more representative of the area under study than the former one. Due to the tack of baseline, the question of sorting out the reserve effect from the site effect is addressed with the help of survey results concerning perceptions and attitudes of users. As regards divers and diving operators, answers to the survey suggest that the reserve effect plays an important role in the attractiveness of the area, Results are not so clear in the case of fishers, an ambiguity reflecting the uncertainty of the spill-over effects expected from marine reserves on fishing grounds, (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

One county promoted a net subsidy program of preferred mesh sizes with a distinct purchase and distribution date, while the other supported the ongoing maintenance of fisheries closures. This provoked a BACI design where standard fisheries statistics were measured 3 years prior to and 2.5 years after the net subsidy, or the life expectancy of these nets. Only similar to 50% of the purchased nets were utilized, indicating a replacement rather than addition of capital and low need. For example, net fishing effort did not change and there was an overall demographic change in gear use away from traps toward lower cost spearguns. Net subsidized fisheries displayed a 9% increase in the mean length of captured fish but also a decline in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) and personal incomes and no change in prices, yields, and per area incomes. In contrast, the fisheries surrounding closures displayed increased fishing effort and a 4% decline in fish lengths but increased CPUE, yield, incomes, and per area revenues. The net cost of maintaining closures was less than the gear subsidy purchase. Significant time x treatment interactions in all indicators support the conclusion that gear subsidies, apart from larger fish sizes, worsened the fisheries, while closures improved it. Increased recruitment rather than growth of fish appeared to be the mechanism for improvement.",3,2019,10.1111/csp2.114,WOS:000577111500013,field,BA,2017,MPA,Kuruwitu,10,medium,2007,fully,,0.3,0.3,small,NA,community-based,Kenya,tropical,Africa,Indian Ocean,NA,,,,,,,artisanal,,fishery,assets,economic,employment,positive,yes,fisher km-2,table 1,SD,SD,,,,5.41,0.587877538,24,,,,4.77,0.391918359,24,,,,,,no sample size given so conservative estimate (nb sampling per month*12months of the year),,

A Thai case study,FISHERIES RESEARCH,,"Some recommendations made by the World Parks Congress in Durban (2003) underscore the need to consider the impacts of multi-purpose marine protected areas (MPAs) on resident or adjacent populations, and lead social and fisheries scientists to reconsider their approaches and methods regarding the assessment of economic effects of an MPA. This paper contributes to this reconsideration by proposing an assessment method of microeconomic effects. The approach is the comparison of fishing households' economic situation in Chumphon Province (Thailand) at a given time based on their location in relation to a marine protected area: within or adjacent to Chumphon Archipelago Marine National Park vs. remote from it. We address three economic dimensions: the profitability of household activities, the income-distributional effects among households and the household vulnerability. This assessment requires the calculation of five indicators: the net income, the net profit margin, the Gini coefficient and the Herfindahl index, and Bene's vulnerability index. From a dataset made up of 123 fishing households surveyed twice a year, the main results show higher incomes and less economic vulnerability for households located within or adjacent to the MPA, and a more inegalitarian income distribution among households located remote from the MPA. So, the households located within or adjacent to the MPA have more security, can stay focused on the most profitable fishing activities and not have to diversify outside of the fishing sector. In an environment where commercial small-scale fishing was already highly developed, setting up an MPA could have the effect of sustaining an efficient, specialised professional set-up for fishing households in the area concerned. With respect to a policy to establish MPAs in keeping with the Durban recommendations, this study shows that a thorough analysis of profitability, income distribution and economic vulnerability should help to identify who the Winners and losers might be, which could improve the targeting of mitigation and compensation measures.

Here, I conducted semi-structured household surveys with 113 women heads-of-households to investigate the influence of two old, well-enforced, no-take marine reserves on food security in four coastal fishing communities in Kenya, East Africa. Multi-model information-theoretic inference and matching methods found that marine reserves did not influence household food security, as measured by protein consumption, diet diversity and food coping strategies. Instead, food security was strongly influenced by fishing livelihoods and household wealth: fishing families and wealthier households were more food secure than non-fishing and poorer households. These findings highlight the importance of complex social and economic landscapes of livelihoods, urbanization, power and gender dynamics that can drive the outcomes of marine conservation and management.",24,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113614,WOS:000345899700043,field,perception,2010,MPA,"Kisite, Watamu",37,,1973,mix,,11,NA,,yes,,Kenya,tropical,Africa,Indian Ocean,coral reef,,,,,,,,,coastal community,food security,local,local food security,neutral,yes,nb of food groups,table 2,SD,SD,,,,4.46,1.42,52,,,,4.9,1.26,59,-0.094086439,,,0.003070131,111,,,

Long-term and well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs) can, under the right circumstances, contribute to biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, thus contributing to food security and sustainable livelihoods. 2. This article emphasizes (1) the potential utility of MPAs as a fisheries management tool, (2) the costs and benefits of MPAs for fishing communities, and (3) the foundations of good governance and management processes for creating effective MPAs with a dual fisheries and conservation mandate. 3. This article highlights case studies from numerous regions of the world that demonstrate practical and often successful solutions in bridging the divide between MPA management and fisheries sustainability, with a focus on small-scale coastal fisheries in order to emphasize lessons learned. 4. To be an effective fisheries management tool, MPAs should be embedded in broader fisheries management and conservation plans. MPAs are unlikely to generate benefits if implemented in isolation. The spatial and temporal distribution of benefits and costs needs to be taken into account since proximal fishery-dependent communities may experience higher fishing costs over the short and long-term while the fisheries benefits from MPAs may only accrue over the long-term. 5. Key lessons for effectively bridging the divide between biodiversity conservation and fisheries sustainability goals in the context of MPAs include: creating spaces and processes for engagement, incorporating fisheries in MPA design and MPAs into fisheries management, engaging fishers in management, recognizing rights and tenure, coordinating between agencies and clarifying roles, combining no-take-areas with other fisheries management actions, addressing the balance of costs and benefits to fishers, making a long-term commitment, creating a collaborative network of stakeholders, taking multiple pressures into account, managing adaptively, recognizing and addressing trade-offs, and matching good governance with effective management and enforcement.

Taking into account that conservation and restoration, food security, employment and social surplus are amongst the objectives that many managers include in fisheries management, it is found that this broader welfare economic approach to MPAs may well recommend them to a greater degree than espoused in the more common resource rent focused studies carried out to date. It is shown that for overfished stocks, an MPA may yield resource protection, maximize harvests and increase consumer and producer surplus, as well as give higher employment.

Consequently, enhancing resilience has become a primary objective for conservation. Nature reserves are a favored management tool, but we need clearer empirical tests of whether they can impart resilience. Catastrophic flooding in early 2011 impacted coastal ecosystems across eastern Australia. We demonstrate that marine reserves enhanced the capacity of coral reefs to withstand flood impacts. Reserve reefs resisted the impact of perturbation, whilst fished reefs did not. Changes on fished reefs were correlated with the magnitude of flood impact, whereas variation on reserve reefs was related to ecological variables. Herbivory and coral recruitment are critical ecological processes that underpin reef resilience, and were greater in reserves and further enhanced on reserve reefs near mangroves. The capacity of reserves to mitigate external disturbances and promote ecological resilience will be critical to resisting an increased frequency of climate-related disturbance.",43,2014,10.1111/gcb.12606,WOS:000342168500005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanism (biological resilience),

Here, we review the observed and likely effectiveness of FSA MPAs, discuss how future studies could fill knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations for MPA design based on species' life history and behaviour, enforcement potential, and management goals. Modelling studies indicate that FSA MPAs can increase spawning-stock biomass and normalize sex ratio in protogynous fish populations, unless fishing mortality remains high outside protected FSA sites and spawning times. In the field, observations of no change or continued decline in spawning biomass are more common than population recovery. When empirical studies suggest that FSA MPAs may not benefit fish productivity or recovery, extenuating factors such as insufficient time since MPA creation, poor or lack of enforcement, inadequate design, and poorly defined management objectives are generally blamed rather than failure of the MPA concept. Results from both the empirical and modelling literature indicate that FSA MPAs may not improve exploitable biomass and fisheries yields; however, investigations are currently too limited to draw conclusions on this point. To implement effective FSA MPAs, additional modelling work, long-term monitoring programmes at FSA sites, and collections of fisheries-dependent data are required, with greater attention paid to the design and enforcement of area closures. We recommend a harmonized, adaptive approach that combines FSA MPA design with additional management measures to achieve explicitly stated objectives. Conservation objectives and, therefore, an overall reduction in mortality rates should be targeted first. Fisheries objectives build on conservation objectives, in that they require an overall reduction in mortality rates while maintaining sufficient access to exploitable biomass. Communication among researchers, regulatory agencies, park authorities, and fishers will be paramount for effective action, along with significant funds for implementation and enforcement.",46,2014,10.1093/icesjms/fsu038,WOS:000343315900001,review,mix,2013,fishery closure,mix,mix,,mix,mix,,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,fish,mix,mix,mix,mix,,fishery,food security,global,catch,ambiguous,no,"""the fisheries effects of FSA MPAs remain uncertain given the lack of consistent findings""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,specific to fishery closures protection spawning aggregations,,

Here, the recent modelling literature on MPA effects for mobile fish populations and their fisheries is reviewed. Modelling studies conducted since 2011 have filled a considerable number of knowledge gaps on the impacts of MPAs for species exhibiting home-range behaviour, nomadic movements or behavioural polymorphism, and on the effects of targeted MPAs, which aim to protect relatively small areas where migratory fishes spend an inordinate fraction of time or are highly vulnerable to fishing (e.g., nursery or spawning zones). Also, in recent years, two studies investigated the consequences of MPAs targeting highly migratory (tuna-like) fish populations for the first time in the history of MPA modelling. Recent modelling studies found that MPAs aimed at protecting mobile species may have positive conservation effects under a relatively wide range of situations, but may generate long-term fisheries benefits only under a very limited set of conditions. In particular, MPAs were not found to be beneficial for the fisheries targeting highly migratory populations. Strategies producing both conservation and fisheries benefits were identified, which depend on fish movement patterns and numerous aspects of fish life history and fisheries dynamics. However, in view of the diversity of fish movement patterns in MPA systems and current dynamics in resource management, it is clear that additional modelling work is needed to fully understand how protected areas affect mobile fish populations and their fisheries and to be able to implement pertinent MPAs. In particular, future modelling studies should systematically assess the effects of MPAs in relation to other management tools to find strategies that are most effective in meeting management objectives, and explore the impacts of dynamic MPAs that follow highly migratory fish populations in space and time.",12,2014,10.1051/alr/2014013,WOS:000347975700001,review,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,reviews what models indicate on the conditions under which MPAs yield fishery benefits

Less well appreciated is that some commercially valuable species respond positively to fishing-induced ecosystem change and can become important fisheries resources in modified ecosystems. Thus, the ecological effects of one fishery can unintentionally increase the abundance and productivity of other fished species (i.e., cultivate). We reviewed examples of this effect in the peer-reviewed literature. We found 2 underlying ecosystem drivers of the effect: trophic release of prey species when predators are overfished and habitat change. Key ecological, social, and economic conditions required for one fishery to unintentionally cultivate another include strong top-down control of prey by predators, the value of the new fishery, and the capacity of fishers to adapt to a new fishery. These unintended cultivation effects imply strong trade-offs between short-term fishery success and conservation efforts to restore ecosystems toward baseline conditions because goals for fisheries and conservation may be incompatible. Conflicts are likely to be exacerbated if fisheries baselines shift relative to conservation baselines and there is investment in the new fishery. However, in the long-term, restoration toward ecosystem baselines may often benefit both fishery and conservation goals. Unintended cultivation can be identified and predicted using a combination of time-series data, dietary studies, models of food webs, and socioeconomic data. Identifying unintended cultivation is necessary for management to set compatible goals for fisheries and conservation. Cultivo Accidental, Lineas de Base Cambiantes y el Conflicto entre los Objetivos para las Pesquerias y la Conservacion Resumen Los efectos de la pesca sobre los ecosistemas marinos y su capacidad para conducir cambios en el estado de los ecosistemas han sido documentados ampliamente. Se aprecia menos que algunas especies con valor comercial responden positivamente a cambios en ecosistemas inducidos por la pesca y pueden volverse recursos pesqueros importantes en ecosistemas modificados. Asi, los efectos ecologicos de una pesqueria pueden incrementar accidentalmente la abundancia y la productividad de otras especies pescadas (p. ej.: cultivar). Revisamos ejemplos de este efecto en la literatura revisada por pares. Encontramos dos conductores de ecosistemas subyacentes del efecto: la liberacion trofica de las especies depredadas cuando los depredadores son sobre-pescados y el cambio de habitat. Las condiciones ecologicas, sociales y economicas clave requeridas para que mas de una pesqueria cultive accidentalmente a otra incluyeron el control jerarquico fuerte de la presa por los depredadores, el valor de una nueva pesquera y la capacidad de los pescadores para adaptarse a una nueva pesquera. Estos efectos accidentales del cultivo implican fuertes pros y contras entre el exito pesquero a corto plazo y los esfuerzos de conservacion para restaurar ecosistemas a las condiciones de linea base porque los objetivos de las pesqueras y de la conservacion pueden ser incompatibles. Los conflictos probablemente sean exacerbados si las lineas base de las pesquerias cambian en relacion a las lineas base de la conservacion y hay inversion en la nueva pesqueria. Sin embargo, a largo plazo, la restauracion hacia las lineas base de los ecosistemas puede beneficiar a los objetivos de la pesqueria y de la conservacion. El cultivo accidental puede identificarse y pronosticarse usando una combinacion de datos de series de tiempo, estudios de dieta, modelos de redes alimentarias y datos socioeconomicos.

In this context, artisanal fisheries, and in particular small-scale coastal fisheries, appear as relevant alternatives for a sustainable use of coastal resources. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are more and more used as management tools for these fisheries, as protection effects and targeted access regulations may benefit to commercial fishers. Managers and scientists need then quantitative information not only to adapt their management to the fishing activity present on their territory, but also to estimate the effects of MPA management on it. This study provides catch and effort estimates that are essential for appraising and managing the artisanal fishery in the Cote Bleue Marine Park (CBMP), a French Mediterranean MPA including two No-Take Zones of different age and size. A field protocol was defined and implemented between July 2009 and June 2010 within the CBMP. Seven m tiers were identified and characterized by target species, gear type, fishing grounds and fishing periods. During the one-year studied period, 3512 fishing trips and 4645 fishing operations were performed by 30 active boats in the Cote Bleue fishing territory, amounting to 9500 km of immersed nets. In total, approximately 130 tons of catch were landed in the six CBMP harbors, out of which 58% depend on the three main species caught on the Cote Bleue: hake (Merluccius merluccius), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and common sole (Solea solea). The presented methodology could be part of a long term monitoring requiring close collaboration with local fishers. It enables adaptive management with respect to changes in fishing pressure (from inside and outside the MPA) that may impact the environment and its resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to contribute with a methodological route that integrates EE to the existing model of management planning and strategies, taking the Colombian National Natural Parks System as a case study. The creation of the route is proposed as a participatory research with different stakeholders in order to respond to the specific conservation needs and goals for the National Parks System. The EE national diagnosis has shown that its integration within the parks management structure is a first priority need, being a converging result on the two case studies on National Parks from the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The diagnosis also demonstrates that communication, participation, training and evaluation have to be reinforced, linking the community and stakeholders involved in the park management to the whole EE process. The proposed methodology route has been agreed upon by the National Parks staff and incorporates advice and recommendations from different stakeholders, in order to better include the park users. This step will help us to advance toward sustainable management in marine and coastal protected areas elsewhere, taking into account not only the biological but also the social cultural prism.

Regardless of the wide range of benefits cited, the effectiveness of reserve establishment depends critically on fisheries management outside the reserves. We construct a bioeconomic model of a fishery that allows for the establishment of a no-take marine reserve and evaluate how the choice of the off-reserve management target influences the effectiveness of reserve establishment. We evaluate two biomass targets: (i) B-MSY or the biomass that produces the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and (ii) B-MEY or the biomass that maximizes the net present value of the returns to fishing. The parameterized model shows that, for a wide range of scenarios, the fishery will be better off in terms of both conservation and economic objectives when the no-take reserve is established in conjunction with the B-MEY target rather than with the B-MSY target. Model results further show that the opportunity cost of securing additional fish biomass, in both deterministic and stochastic environments, is lower when the reserve size is increased under the B-MEY target. This finding is important because marine reserves have been established as a key measure to restore depleted fish stocks, and the results suggest that this objective can be achieved with lower economic costs in a B-MEY managed fishery.",7,2014,10.1111/faf.12008,WOS:000334679000002,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

Since the MPA designation, there has been an increase in vessels using static gear inside and outside the MPA, with a significant positive trend for vessels using static gear inside the MPA. Over time, static gear landings have decreased by 110 kg per vessel per month, although there has been a significant positive trend over time in value (landings of 1,452 pound per vessel per month), linked to catches of high value species such as lobster, which are associated with the reef ecosystem. Fishing activity providing high volume (weight) and value landings from vessels using mobile demersal gears within the MPA ceased in July 2008. Mobile demersal gear fishing effort has since increased significantly outside the MPA. The value of mobile demersal gear landings in 2017 are comparable to fishing activity prior to the MPA designation, but has not reached the peak landings values of 2008 when the MPA was designated. Fishers predominantly using mobile demersal gear report lower subjective wellbeing and material losses. Static gear fishers report higher levels of subjective wellbeing over time compared to their mobile demersal gear counterparts.

Successful management should reduce pressure on natural resources within its core area as well as enable local communities to participate in the management of buffer zone resources in a sustainable manner. The Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve was declared in 1996 to protect coral reefs and marine biodiversity, while also enabling fishing cooperatives to maintain their livelihoods based upon the sustainable extraction of lobster, conch, and scalefish.

This article provides an overview of the long struggle to conserve queen conch populations in the area. Particular attention is paid to describing the various forms of resistance fishermen employed to counter the increasing regulation and vigilance that accompanied the creation of the Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve. This case chronicles the resistance to regulation and interpersonal violence that erupts when entrenched attitudes and practices are confronted with increasing surveillance. Thus, what was observed in the Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve parallels other research that depicts the forms of resistance to conservation that local people enact when confronted with conservation interventions.

There are times when these uses contribute to ecosystem degradation that may eventually lead to a systems' collapse. In addition to studies of technical means for predicting and controlling the systems, the understanding of human dimensions, institutional and social-interaction issues has been considered important for improving effective governance of these systems. This paper presents a multilevel analytical framework and discusses application of this framework to the context of three MPAs in Vietnam. It discusses the development of the framework based on a new perspective that views institutions as a structure and governance as a process for operating a governing system. As a result, inter-relations and mutual influences of institutions and governance occurred within the MPAs are illustrated as a cause effect relationship diagram. These are grouped into three components (i) formal institutions; (ii) political behaviour and organizational structure; and (iii) local communities' engagement, social capital and socio-economic conditions. These components interact with each other and influence the interplays of actors, both state and non-state, for MPA governance. Findings from this study suggest that institutions should be adaptive and regularly amended based on their performance in real-world governance processes. This ensures the match between the approved institutions and their practical effects in complex contextual conditions. Meanwhile, there should be accountable and transparent dialogues and mechanisms for all the stakeholders and actors to be actively involved in the development of institutions, and evaluating and monitoring governance processes. Bridging actors or organizations also need to be available as active facilitators of these dialogues and mechanisms. When the institutional and social-interaction issues are solved, governance of coupled human-natural systems, such as MPAs, will be enhanced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial fishing vessels were chartered for 25 dedicated long-lining trips to collect sexually mature Haddock in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary at locations identified by commercial fishers as having spawning aggregations. In order to examine diel effects on Haddock reproduction, the changes in CPUE and percentages of male and female Haddock of all reproductive maturity stages, as well as gonadosomatic index (GSI), were observed across a 24-h diel cycle. The comparison of diel patterns among different maturation stages was used to differentiate diel periodicity due to spawning from feeding behavior. Diel periodicity was observed for the proportion of males and females in the catch, the proportion and CPUE of male and female maturation stages most indicative of imminent spawning, and for female GSI. Although spawning occurred throughout the diel cycle, peak spawning of females occurred during the evening hours (1700-2100hours) and gradually declined to low values during the day at 0900hours. In an apparent contradiction male spawning stages were uniformly high except for lows during the night between 2100 and 0100hours. We hypothesize that this pattern is consistent with lekking behavior where strong competition among spawning-ready males during courtship would reduce their feeding activity during the peak spawning hours. Strong annual differences in diel periodicity may have resulted from different temporal patterns in the spawning season or density dependence, or both.

Results showed that these fish are year-round resident, remaining inside the fully protected area of the marine reserve of Cerbere-Banyuls (65 ha) and display a diurnal activity pattern. Records from depth sensors revealed that groupers range inside small, distinct, and individual territories. Individual variations in habitat depth are only visible on a seasonal scale, i.e., between the spawning season and the rest of the year. In fact, during summer months when the seawater temperature exceeded 20 degrees C, tagged groupers made vertical spawning migrations of 4-8 m in amplitude. These vertical migrations are characteristic of the reproductive behaviour of dusky groupers, during which they release their gametes. The results are notable for the implementation of management rules in marine protected areas, such as reduced navigation speed, boating or attendance during spawning season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Theory suggests that a reserve network will function synergistically when connected by dispersal, but the scale of dispersal is often unknown. On the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada, both countries have recently implemented a number of rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) to protect exploited rockfish species, but no study has evaluated the connectivity within networks in each country or between the two countries. We used isolation-by-distance theory to estimate the scale of dispersal from microsatellite data in the black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, and compared this estimate with the distance between RCAs that would protect this species. Within each country, we found that the distance between RCAs was generally within the confidence intervals of mean dispersal per generation. The distance between these two RCA networks, however, was greater than the average dispersal per generation. The data were also consistent with a genetic break between southern Oregon and central Oregon.

The entire area was already a highly regulated zone which had been subject to a well-managed fisheries licensing system. The island of Diego Garcia, the only area where there is evidence of overfishing has, because of its military base, been excluded from the MPA. The no-take mandate removes the primary source of sustenance and economic sustainability of any inhabitants, thus effectively preventing the return of the original residents who were removed for political reasons in the 1960s and 1970s. The principles of natural resource conservation and use have been further distorted by forcing offshore fishing effort to other less well-managed areas where it will have a greater negative impact on the well-being of the species that were claimed to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the declaration. A failure to engage stakeholders has resulted in challenges in both the English courts and before an international tribunal.",21,2014,10.1016/B978-0-12-800214-8.00003-7,WOS:000349890300004,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not primary research results

Less attention has been paid to the sustainable use of fisheries resources so that future generations have access to these resources, or to the creation of mechanisms that might contribute to the intergenerational continuity of recruitment of fisheries workers and the regeneration of fisheries communities. In this paper we report on young people's experiences and perceptions of fisheries employment in Newfoundland and Labrador to deepen our understanding of the resiliency of small-scale fisheries. We found that these young people's experiences of fisheries employment are extremely limited and their perceptions of the quality of fisheries work is primarily negative while, at the same time, they recognize its importance to the vitality of their communities.

The goal is to assess the applicability of Ostrom's design principles for sustainable resource governance to large scale systems, as well as to examine other important variables that may determine success in large scale systems. While we find support for some of Ostrom's design principles (boundaries, monitoring, sanctions, fit to conditions, and conflict resolution mechanisms are all supported), other principles have only moderate to weak support. In particular, recognition of rights to organize and the accountability of monitors to resource users were not supported. We argue that these differences are the result of differences between small and large scale systems. At large scales, other kinds of political dynamics, including the role of scientists and civil society organizations, appear to play key roles. Other variables emphasized in common-pool resource studies, such as levels of dependence on resources, group size, heterogeneity, disturbances, and resource characteristics also receive mixed support, pointing to the need to reinterpret the meaning of common-pool resource theories in order for them to be applicable at larger scales.",43,2014,10.18352/ijc.416,WOS:000341885200007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not only marine,

These were assessed using a combination of primary and secondary data.

Some MPAs are also established to benefit fisheries through increased egg and larval production, or the spillover of mobile juveniles and adults. Whether spillover influences fishery landings depend on the population status and movement patterns of target species both inside and outside of MPAs, as well as the status of the fishery and behavior of the fleet. We tested whether an increase in the lobster population inside two newly established MPAs influenced local catch, fishing effort, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) within the sustainable California spiny lobster fishery. We found greater build-up of lobsters within MPAs relative to unprotected areas, and greater increases in fishing effort and total lobster catch, but not CPUE, in fishing zones containing MPAs vs. those without MPAs. Our results show that a 35% reduction in fishing area resulting from MPA designation was compensated for by a 225% increase in total catch after 6-years, thus indicating at a local scale that the trade-off of fishing ground for no-fishing zones benefitted the fishery.",0,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-82371-5,WOS:000616803100046,field,BACI,2017,MPA,Campus Point,5,medium,2012,fully,,26.88,26.88,medium,NA,state,USA,temperate,North America,North East Pacific,rocky reef,,,invertebrate,Panulirus interruptus,fished,,small-scale,adjacent,fishery,food security,global,cpue,neutral,yes,kg trap-1,figure 2,recalculated,SD,0.83,0.122474487,6,0.83,0.293938769,6,0.52,0.1464,18,0.63,0.1473,18,0.191891008,,,0.031972462,,"comparison includes reserve, before and after",,

Two sites were protected from fishing for over 20 years, whereas the other five sites were heavily fished in recent years. A heavily fished site was converted into a marine park (Mombasa Marine National Park, approximately 10km(2), no fishing allowed), and the number of fishers allowed was slowly decreased between August 1991 and August 1992. The area adjacent to the park was converted into a marine reserve (only fishing traps, lines, and gill nets allowed) that provided fishing grounds for fishers excluded from the park. Data from a fish-landing site adjacent to the newly created marine park were collected for 3 years and analyzed to determine the effect of the park's creation on fish catches. Results suggest that fishing in the reserve reduced fish wet weight by about a factor of 10 and reduced fish numbers and species richness by a factor of two. Both field studies and landing site's fishing grounds were protected with the creation of the park, and 65% of the fishers quit the studied landing, leaving nearly the same density of fishers in the remaining area (similar to 12 fishers/km(2)). Further, fishers using pull seines were excluded from the reserve, and their numbers were replaced by fishers using other gear (mostly basket traps). Although the overall catch per unit effort increased by about 110% after the park's creation, the total fish landed decreased by 35% and the catch per unit effort decreased toward the end of the study period despite increasing fish abundance in the park. Although establishment of small parks elsewhere have increased the total catch, the large park we studied did not; one reason may nave been the lower ratio of edge to park area of the large park. Alternatively, the park's edge may have provided a good fishing area, so fishing effort may have been highest along the park's edge. Consequently, a barrier may have been created that restricted fish dispersal to most of the reserve. Therefore, the area that had an increased catch was small (<1 to 2km from the edge) and could not compensate for the lose fishing area. Most fish species within the park showed recovery after fisher exclusion. Total fish wet weights 3 years after the fisher's exclusion were 25% below the older marine parks. Poor recovery of the herbivorous parrot and surgeonfish can account for much of this shortfall. Competition for resources with sea urchins appear to be slowing recovery of these two groups. A study site 2.5 km from the park's southern boundary, in the reserve section of the protected area, showed no changes in fish abundance over the study period, despite changing gear regulations.",223,1996,10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10041187.x,WOS:A1996VC10300035,field,BA,1994,MPA,Mombasa,2,young,1992,fully,,10,10,medium,yes,,Kenya,tropical,Africa,Indian Ocean,seagrass,,,fish,,,,artisanal,adjacent,fishery,food security,global,cpue,positive,yes,kg-1 person-1 month-1,table 1,SD,SD,20.3,6.7,8,67.1,69.7,24,,,,,,,1.195563158,,,0.058574802,,,,

We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41% on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.",25,2014,10.2989/1814232X.2014.893256,WOS:000336036600003,field,,,fishery closure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,periodic no take zone

Identifying and understanding socioeconomic conditions and the institutional context of fishing communities is essential to achieve success with MPAs. We propose a practical methodology for estimating the adaptive capacity (AC) of local communities to the establishment of MPAs. Adaptive capacity is defined as the ability of households to anticipate and respond to disturbances, natural or human induced, and to minimize, cope with, and recover from the consequences. We propose an index of adaptive capacity (IAC) of fishing communities that can be estimated at a local scale. This composite index comprises three dimensions, i.e., socioeconomic, social-ecological, and socio-political/institutional, which attempt to capture comprehensively the determinants of AC. Each dimension is constructed from three indicators, whose estimation is based on information collected from a household structured survey for which we suggested specific questions. We proposed the use of a Min function to highlight the weakest dimension of the IAC and guide decision makers with respect to elements that should be addressed to improve AC.

Resource users' perceptions of the benefits of restrictions were generally high and widespread, but some less positive perceptions were found in three villages located near marine protected areas. Perceptions of the benefits of gear restrictions had widespread support; closed areas, seasons, and minimum sizes of fish were less common; and restrictions on species were supported infrequently. We therefore advocate a management implementation approach that uses these scales of perceived benefits and prioritizes support for the most widely accepted restrictions most broadly, with the less accepted restrictions matched to specific supportive locations. At the village level, socioeconomic and wealth variables were not clearly associated with perceived benefits, which we suggest results from a stronger influence of village history than socioeconomic conditions. At the individual fisher level, however, there was evidence that experienced people involved in decision-making, having livelihood alternatives, and having permanent housing had more opinions and frequently were more supportive of management restrictions.

However, in recent years Pollicipes has attracted increased harvesting pressure due to its high market value. In a national park on the south-western coast of Portugal, legislation was formulated to address the overharvesting of this resource; however, its success has been limited due to lack of consensus among stakeholders. A Systems Approach Framework (SAF) was used to assess the socio-economic and cultural issues surrounding the harvest of Pollicipes. As part of this, interviews and a questionnaire survey were undertaken in the municipality of Vila do Bispo, in order to explore the perspectives of the shell fishers, local residents and restaurateurs. The majority of the stakeholders believed that the resource was overharvested and that their needs should be considered as part of the legislation formulation process. The stakeholders also agreed that the local market should be re-established and that the temporal closure period should be reconsidered. Stakeholder opinions differed with regard to the level of coastal management enforcement required, the licence distribution process and the restrictions implemented by national park authorities. It is concluded that using information such as that gathered from local stakeholders, it should be possible to effectively extend the SAF to simulate scenarios for future management options.

The way in which local news outlets present and explain MPAs to local communities is likely to be influential in determining how they respond to the proposal. In particular the tendency of news media to focus on areas of conflict and dispute ensures ideology and politics play a central role in reporting of MPA proposals, often simplifying debate into an 'us versus them' or 'fishers versus conservationists' ideological conflict. This can lead to the outright rejection of an MPA or undermine acceptance of the park within local communities. The media coverage of two marine parks in NSW, Australia was compared to determine the way in which news presented the parks to each community and how this may have influenced public acceptance of the parks. In particular the study examined the role ideology and politics played in the news coverage of each park by investigating the way in which the news was framed and the positions of key media spokespeople. Media coverage of the Batemans Marine Park appears to have been highly politicised and heavily influenced by the strong convictions of a small handful of prominent spokespeople. By way of contrast media coverage of the Port Stephens Great Lakes Marine Park was more nuanced and drew from a wide range of sources. This research provides insight into how areas of conflict could be reframed as opportunities that enhance MPA planning exercises and highlights how ideology can help shape community sentiment. Acknowledging the role of ideology in contested areas such as these allows for the development of strategies that can accommodate as well as moderate its influence. These strategies may include the incorporation of 'bottom up' approaches into MPA planning, the promotion and support of a range of voices within the community, and seeking out and building upon common ground and shared values.

Across the Indo-Pacific periodically-harvested closures are commonly employed, yet their contribution towards more sustainable fisheries remains largely untested in the social and ecological context of tropical small-scale fisheries. To address this, we use an interdisciplinary approach to examine harvesting dynamics that would affect sustainability, namely, fishing effort, yield, gear and method use, periodicity of harvesting, controls placed on harvesting and resource owners' decisions to open and close four fishing grounds in Solomon Islands. We compare these fishing patterns with those on surrounding, continuously open fishing grounds. Our study shows that total effort and total catch from periodically-harvested reef closures are low to moderate compared to reefs open to continuous fishing. When periodically-harvested closures were opened, effort in the closures was relatively intense, however, in most cases yield did not exceed annual benchmarks of sustainability described by previous studies. In some cases, harvesting during openings was restricted to a single taxon and single fishing gear and method, while in others there was unrestricted multi-species and multi-method harvesting. The duration and frequency of openings were highly variable, with open periods ranging from a single night to one month in duration, and occurring between one and 15 times per year. Fishing during openings was permitted for entire fishing communities in some cases, and only for specific rights-holding families in others. Decisions to open periodically-harvested closures tended to be based on immediate social or economic needs, and the openings provided a small boost to fish catch landed in communities. While periodically-harvested closures may alleviate fishing pressure in a small area of fishing grounds by reducing the opportunity to fish, openings of long duration or high frequency, combined with heavy or destructive exploitation, may lead to unsustainable harvesting within the area.

Through an analysis of documents and 90 interviews collected by two independent research projects, this paper examines the designation process of a U.S. LMPA, the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument (MTMNM), which was established in the waters of the U.S. territories of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam through a presidential proclamation under the U.S. Antiquities Act in 2009. Results indicate that overall the designation process for the Monument did not cohere with recommendations from nearshore MPA research about the importance of participation and transparency. Despite widespread support for conservation in that space, the proposed Monument was highly controverial. Stakeholders on all sides of the issue - advocates and opponents alike - expressed criticisms of the designation process. Concerns were related to the speed and perceived top-down nature of the process, the involvement of external entities, and the appropriateness of the process design for the local CNMI context. Data collected showed that much of the opposition to the Monument stemmed from how the process was conducted, rather than opposition to conservation. These findings suggest that a more participatory, collaborative, transparent, and culturally appropriate designation process might have achieved a similar conservation outcome while reducing conflict and enduring resentment. We derive six lessons learned from the MTMNM designation process that may be useful for LMPAs globally. Results suggest that key lessons from conventional MPAs about effective consultation and participation processes can apply to LMPAs, but also that new guidance is needed to account for the unique features of LMPAs.",2,2019,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109624,WOS:000496035000036,field,perception,2014,MPA,Marianas Trench,5,medium,2009,PPA,,0,246608,large,NA,state,USA,tropical,Asia,West Pacific,mix,,,,,,,,,coastal community,agency,,participation,negative,no,overall outcome of interviews,text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,outcome of mechanism to unclear,,

We carried out household surveys, designed to obtain information for indicators and sub-indicators, and calculated the IAC.

Our findings show that, despite being located between two MPAs, the fishing community of Bazan in the Colombian Pacific is highly vulnerable and that the socioeconomic dimension of the IAC constitutes the most binding dimension for building adaptive capacity. Bazan is characterized by extreme poverty, high dependence on resources, and lack of basic public infrastructure. Notwithstanding, social capital and local awareness about ecological conditions may act as enhancers of adaptive capacity.

In this study, we used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to understand what drives the use of marine and coastal areas, to explore local and expert views of the marine environment and its conservation, and ultimately to determine approaches to MPA management that best reflect local needs and desires. The study focused on Corvo Island, which includes the largest coastal MPA in the Azores Archipelago, yet remains without a current management plan. Evidence of a strong ocean-oriented cultural identity, with a clear gender dichotomy in the patterns of marine and coastal use, was found. Participants recognized the strategic value of the marine environment for the island's economy, and strategies to promote the sustainable use of marine resources based on local values and views were suggested. There was a widespread perception of declining species abundance, ecological unbalances caused by biodiversity loss, and significant changes from the status quo with regards to the maritime environment. This was reflected in a common recognition of marine ecosystem vulnerability, yet the local community and stakeholders presented different views on what the main threats were. In any case, we found strong local support for marine conservation initiatives, particularly MPAs. However, stakeholders differed in their views on MPA goals and outcomes, reflecting negative perceptions on the government's capacity to manage the Corvo MPA. Based on these results, we discuss implications for MPA implementation, particularly for the development of specific MPA goals shared by all stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, reserve systems that have a high chance of protecting good condition habitats cost fishers less than 3.1% of their income. Second, cost to fishers can be reduced by 1/2-2/3 by triaging less than 1/3 of habitats. Finally, increasing the probability of protecting good condition habitats from 50% to 99% costs fishers an additional 1.7% of their income, with roughly 0.3% added costs for each additional 10% confidence.

The change can therefore impact (both positively and negatively) upon the fishing community. MPA managers who miss out the social context in management decisions and fail to acknowledge the unique nature of fishing activities and responses to change are risking the future ability of MPAs to meet stake-holders' needs. To inform management, this research uses a structured interview methodology to gain quantitative and qualitative data from fishermen operating in a case study area. The results demonstrate that the marine environment in the case study area supports a small scale, profitable fishing industry where the well-being of the respondents is linked to their fishing activity. To maintain a sustainable industry there is a need to align the objectives of the new proposed MPAs (Marine Conservation Zones) with fishery objectives and create systems for the co-management of marine resources supported by collaborative monitoring programmes.

M.",Governing marine protected areas: Social-ecological resilience through institutional diversity,MARINE POLICY,,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) worldwide are facing increasing driving forces, which represent a major and increasing challenge for MPA governance. The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) project examined a range of different incentives - economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative - employed to address the driving forces and promote effectiveness in 20 case studies across the globe. This paper argues that, regardless of the MPA governance approach adopted (i.e., government-led, decentralised, private or community-led), resilience in MPA governance systems derives from employing a diversity of inter-connected incentives. The significance of institutional diversity to governance systems parallels that of species diversity to ecosystems, conferring resilience to the overall socio-ecological system. The paper concludes that, in the face of strong driving forces, rather than relying on particular types of incentives and institutions, it is important to recognise that the key to resilience is diversity, both of species in ecosystems and of institutions in governance systems.

The governance approach adopted in the SCR-NMNR is characterised by significant decentralisation, i.e. many roles have been devolved to the local government. However, this has led to the undermining of strategic conservation objectives by local economic development priorities, through the rapid development of mass tourism involving both the private sector and the local government. This reliance on economic incentives has provided alternative livelihoods and resources for the management of the MPA, but has also incurred environmental and social costs. Overall, it can be argued that the current governance approach cannot effectively address the full spectrum of challenges encountered, in that these costs appear to outweigh the benefits. In order to improve the governance of the SCR-NMNR towards more effective and equitable outcomes, strengthened leadership from the central state will be needed, as well as a sense of community stewardship towards the MPA.

S.",A governance analysis of the Galapagos Marine Reserve,MARINE POLICY,,"The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) has faced major governance challenges since its designation in 1998, largely due to the driving forces of immigration from the mainland; a heterogeneous population that has a mainland rather than an island identity; increasing demand for marine resources from global seafood markets; and the rapid growth of tourism. Until recently, the pressures related to these driving forces had challenged measures to promote the effectiveness of the GMR. Decisions taken through the participatory management structure were often undermined by a combination of civil unrest, illegal activities and lack of enforcement. A recent period of relative political stability, coupled with several new measures to address these driving forces, has improved the potential effectiveness of the governance framework. These measures include controls on immigration, the use of remote surveillance technologies to enforce fishing restrictions and a system for the improved management of tourism vessels. Whilst participative and economic incentives will continue to be important, increasing political will to promote long-term sustainability and related improvements in the use of legal incentives, including enforcement technologies and effective prosecutions for those who breach restrictions, are likely to be key elements of the governance framework. It is argued that these measures, coupled with the emergence of a more marine-aware generation of Galapagos citizens, should pave the way for major improvements in the effectiveness of the GMR, hopefully sufficiently strengthening the governance framework to withstand the major driving forces that could, otherwise perturb it.

Economic incentives resulting from strategic alliances between the public and private sector have been targeted towards enhanced regulation of fisheries and supporting tourism interests. However, the absence of coherent policies relating to tourism, which partly reflects contests over jurisdiction between national and local levels of government, opens up considerable potential for inappropriate forms of development Furthermore, any incentives designed to facilitate governance should explicitly recognise the status of the Bajau, who constitute a key stakeholder group yet have been consistently marginalised through both state and NGO initiatives. The possible outcomes of ongoing decentralisation, which include enhanced government accountability, flexibility in developing regulations relating to marine resource use and greater participation of minority groups in decision-making, offer some prospect for improved governance of the Wakatobi and other marine protected areas in Indonesia.

Tourism is the major driver of the local economy of these coastal regions and is heavily concentrated in the summer months of July and August. Coordinated management of natural coastal and marine resources with sustainable exploitation is urgently required in the tourism hotspots of the region. The Cres-Losinj Special Marine Reserve (CLSMR) was designated in 2006 with the specific aim to conserve a local dolphin population and sustainably manage the use of the natural resources of the Cres-Losinj archipelago. The archipelago is a nationally important region for tourism. Between July 2006 and July 2009 the CLSMR was the largest marine protected area (MPA) in the Adriatic Sea. The CLSMR represented Croatian commitments to many of the international environmental agreements signed by the government. However local development commitments made by the sitting political party was in direct conflict with the objectives of the MPA.

Spatial management is used extensively in natural resource management to address sustainability and biodiversity issues, for example through declaration of terrestrial National Parks and marine protected areas (MPAs). 2. Spatial management is used also to optimize yields or protect key parts of the life cycle of species that are utilized (hunted, farmed or fished), for example through rotational harvesting. 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of marine spatial closures with conflicting fisheries and conservation objectives, a series of marine fisheries closures are here analysed using an integrative modelling tool known as management strategy evaluation (MSE). 4. This modelling framework combines a food web model of a tropical ecosystem fished by a prawn (shrimp) fishery that emulates the resource being managed, together with the present management system and risk-based tools of fishing the prawn species at maximum economic yield. 5. A series of spatial closures are designed and tested with the aim of investigating trade-offs among biodiversity (MPA), benthic impacts, ecosystem function, key species at risk to fishing, economic and sustainability objectives. 6. Synthesis and applications. This paper illustrates that existing tools often available in actively managed fisheries can be linked together into an effective management strategy evaluation framework. Spatial closures tended to succeed with respect to their specific design objective, but this benefit did not necessarily flow to other broad-scale objectives.

In more recent decades, MPAs have been used by coastal and ocean managers to protect special areas for a wide range of purposes - protecting threatened or rare species, conserving areas for biological diversity and other ecological functions, setting aside areas for recreation - as well as a fisheries management tool. While the role of an MPA in protecting species or biological diversity is fairly well understood, their role as fisheries management tools is more complex and controversial.

However, detecting the benefits of spatial management actions can be difficult, especially considering the large spatial range of most fished stocks. The common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a premier target species in Florida's estuaries and the fishery is entirely recreational with 96% of the fish caught returned to the water by anglers. However, the management conservation objective of maintaining a spawning potential ratio (SPR) greater than 40% is not always achieved under current regulatory practices. We developed a spatially explicit, age-based, dynamic simulation model to evaluate management actions that could achieve target SPR objectives by incorporating spatial closures. The snook stocks of the east and west coasts of Florida were both assumed to be comprised of three substocks that each occupied a separate estuarine system with limited larval and adult interconnectivity. The model was used to evaluate scenarios incorporating different combinations of closures. A scenario that had partial snook-fishing closures (two systems allowing catch-and-release fishing only and one system also allowing snook harvest) was compared with a scenario in which all three systems had snook harvest. The partially closed scenario attained balanced results with 60% SPR, 54% of the unfished abundance of trophy-size snook, 48% of maximum harvest in numbers, and 51% of maximum yield in weight.

While progress has been made on spatial coverage, the fundamental aspects of effectiveness and equity are falling short. Past research has focused on management effectiveness in MPAs, but less attention has been given to social equity though it is an ethical imperative and instrumental to conservation. This study assessed the perceptions of SSF regarding recognitional, procedural and distributional dimensions of social equity using quantitative surveys in 11 MPAs across 6 countries on the Mediterranean Sea. To do so, we developed individual indicators from which we created composite scores for recognitional, procedural, and distributional equity, and a combined social equity score. Overall, descriptive results showed that SSF perceptions of social equity were quite varied but slightly skewed towards positive perceptions. Then, we developed predictive models to analyze the effects of geographic (i.e., MPA and country) and individual (i.e., SSF demographics and characteristics) factors on the composite social equity scores. All social equity scores differed significantly between MPAs. Being an older fisher was associated with a decrease in recognitional equity, while having a higher level of relative wealth or more diversified livelihoods was associated with higher scores for distributional equity. These results point to the need for tailored management actions to improve equity in different MPA sites and for different groups. This paper presents a novel quantitative method for using stakeholder perceptions to examine social equity that might be applied to marine and terrestrial conservation initiatives elsewhere.",5,2020,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108531,WOS:000526787400019,field,perception,2017,MPA,mix,mix,NA,mix,mix,,mix,mix,NA,mix,mix,mix,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean,mix,,,,,,,small-scale,,fishery,food security,local,local food security,neutral,yes,% interviewees,figure 2 (food security),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,indicator not suitable for MA,,

Restrictions to control the recreational harvest were first implemented in 2006 and were highly criticized by the angler community, for being highly restrictive and lacking scientific support. The present study aimed to obtain socio-economic data on the recreational shore anglers and gauge their perceptions about recreational fishing regulations and the newly implemented restrictions in Portugal. Roving creel surveys were conducted along the south and south-west coasts of Portugal, during pre and post regulation periods (2006-2007). A total of 1298 valid face-to-face interviews were conducted. Logit models were fitted to identify which characteristics influence anglers' perceptions about recreational fishing regulations. The majority of the interviewed anglers was aware and agreed with the existence of recreational fishing regulations. However, most were against the recreational fishing regulations currently in place. The logit models estimates revealed that Portuguese anglers with a higher level of formal education and income are more likely to agree with the existence of recreational fishing regulations. In contrast, anglers who perceive that more limitations and a better enforcement of commercial fishing would improve fishing in the area are less likely to agree with the existence of SRF regulations. The findings from this study will contribute to inform decision-makers about anglers' potential behaviour towards the new and future regulations. Although the existence of fishing regulations is a good starting point for effective management, the lack of acceptance and detailed knowledge of the regulations in place by fishers may result in lack of compliance, and ultimately hinder the success of recreational fishing regulations in Portugal.

Despite this, few studies have satisfactorily assessed the dynamics of fishers' adaptations to the loss of fishing grounds. Here we used data from before, during and after the implementation of the management plan of a temperate Atlantic multiple-use MPA to examine the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of different gears used by the artisanal fishing fleet. The position of vessels and gear types were obtained by visual surveys and related to spatial features of the marine park. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify heavily utilized patches for each fishing gear and time period. The contribution of individual vessels to each significant cluster was assessed to better understand fishers' choices. Different fisheries responded differently to the implementation of protection measures, with preferred habitats of target species driving much of the fishers' choices. Within each fishery, individual fishers showed distinct strategies with some operating in a broader area whereas others kept preferred territories. Our findings are based on reliable methods that can easily be applied in coastal multipurpose MPAs to monitor and assess fisheries and fishers responses to different management rules and protection levels.

The designation objectives and scopes, zoning schemes, management tasks, and environmental requirements of SMPA are different from Marine Natural Reserve (MNR). Different voices from supporters and opponents were raised on this new kind of policy. For a better understanding on this policy, we analyzed SMPA and its relationship and difference with MNR, dissected development of SMPAs in China, and discussed its governance, management and experiences. The main findings are: (1) SMPA policy is a complementary strategy for MNR policy. SMPA policy can reduce the conflicts and narrow the gap between conservation and local economic development; (2) The coverage of SMPA has sharply increased since the establishment of the first national SMPA in 2005,which demonstrates the Chinese government has paid great attention to multiple-use of marine resources in order to achieve sustainable development. (3) Lack of financial funding, baseline data and scientific research are affecting the effectiveness of conservation and management of SMPA policy. In order to ameliorate the SMPA policy, we suggest (1) making overall strategic planning for multiple-use of marine resources, (2) coordinating the role of central government and local government, and considering the up-bottom system as a complement, and (3) increasing financial support from central government and local government, accumulating baseline data, and conducting systematic scientific research. Given all the features of SMPA Policy, we considered it as an emerging and key mechanism for protection of marine ecosystem and a trade-off between ecological conservation and economic development in China.

Although fully protected areas have well-documented outcomes, including increased fish diversity and biomass, the effectiveness of partially protected areas is contested. Partially protected areas may provide benefits in some contexts and may be warranted for social reasons, yet social outcomes often depend on MPAs achieving their ecological goals to distinguish them from open areas and justify the cost of protection. We assessed the social perceptions and ecological effectiveness of 18 partially protected areas and 19 fully protected areas compared with 19 open areas along 7000 km of coast of southern Australia. We used mixed methods, gathering data via semistructured interviews, site surveys, and Reef Life (underwater visual census) surveys. We analyzed qualitative data in accordance with grounded theory and quantitative data with multivariate and univariate linear mixed-effects models. We found no social or ecological benefits for partially protected areas relative to open areas in our study. Partially protected areas had no more fish, invertebrates, or algae than open areas; were poorly understood by coastal users; were not more attractive than open areas; and were not perceived to have better marine life than open areas. These findings provide an important counterpoint to some large-scale meta-analyses that conclude partially protected areas can be ecologically effective but that draw this conclusion based on narrower measures. We argue that partially protected areas act as red herrings in marine conservation because they create an illusion of protection and consume scarce conservation resources yet provide little or no social or ecological gain over open areas. Fully protected areas, by contrast, have more fish species and biomass and are well understood, supported, and valued by the public.

Here, we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off.

Efforts to expand the network of MPAs are contested largely due to historical injustices associated with MPA establishment and the ongoing social impacts linked with their current management and governance. This paper presents findings of recent research on the social dimensions of MPAs in five MPAs in South Africa. Drawing on information gathered from 70 oral histories, over 250 key informant interviews and 28 focus groups, the paper examines key social impacts respondents attribute to MPAs and their establishment and ongoing management. Significant negative impacts reported include the weakening of local governance rights and processes, in particular the lack of effective mechanisms for local community participation in decision making. The loss of tenure rights and access to resources amongst already marginalised communities has contributed to food insecurity, less exchange of food and less household income. The MPAs investigated have impacted on culture, way of life and sense of place. Yet, despite government commitments to several international policy instruments relevant to MPAs and national laws legislating redress, social issues associated with MPAs have been largely overlooked. Findings from this research demonstrate that the failure to address historical impacts, as well as social hardships and inequities still being experienced, undermine the legitimacy of MPAs and frustrate the achievement of objectives and plans to increase the marine space under protection.

An EBSM approach was adopted in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) at the end of the 1990s with the adoption of marine zoning. The latter was created under a co-management regime to reduce conflicts among users arising over incompatible demands for ocean space, to mitigate the impact of human activities on sensitive ecological areas, and to contribute to the sustainability of Galapagos fisheries. Unfortunately, the promise of an EBSM approach in the GMR has not been matched by effectiveness in practice, in achieving the established management objectives. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the shortcomings and lessons learned related to planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and adaptation of the GMR's marine zoning scheme, and to provide recommendations to better realize the potential value of the EBSM approach to co-managing the shellfisheries of the GMR.

Over one hundred million people living in its coastal zones use this biodiversity to support their livelihoods. Hundreds of millions more derive nutritious food directly from the region's marine resources and through local, regional and global trade. Biodiversity and its values to society are threatened by demographic and habitat change, rising demand, intensive harvesting and climate change. In partnership with international conservation organisations and development funders, the governments of the region's six countries have come together to develop the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security. The CTI has explicit goals and defined targets for marine biodiversity conservation, but not for the food security of the region's marine-resource dependent people, despite this being the wider aim used to justify conservation action. This article suggests how the food security aim of the CTI could be made more explicit. It outlines the complex pathways linking marine biodiversity with food security and argues that improved social science analysis, inter-sectoral policy and management interactions are necessary if conserving marine biodiversity is to contribute towards meeting food security challenges in the region.

The total habitat is divided into two patches: one is reserve area where fishing is completely banned and other zone is called fishing area where only prey is exploited. We assume that the prey fish possesses heterogeneous intrinsic growth rate with uniform carrying capacity where as predator has constant intrinsic growth rate with prey dependent carrying capacity. The analytical conditions are derived to prevent the species extinction for larger employed effort in single (only prey) species fishery. Optimal equilibrium premium are presented for both monospecies and multispecies fishery for all degree of protection. Increasing standing stock (ISS) and protected standing stock (PSS) are measured in the presence of prey predator interaction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

On this backdrop, for the first MPA designation in Japan, an investigative commission centering on fishery operators has been set up in Tsushima, Nagasaki Prefecture. This study provides insights into the methods being considered for establishing an MPA at Tsushima. The content of our research was as follows: First, we created a map using the Geographic Information System (GIS) to collect information about potential Protected Areas as determined by each local fishery corporation and clarify how they identified important fishery sites. Second, we identified marine area that should be protected in view of the results of an analysis of fish catches, geographical conditions, and physical conditions complexly determined by using GIS. Third, we carried out local observations to clarify the close relationships between fishing ground locations, sea- bottom topography and tidal flows. Results are following: 1. Visualizing information using GIS allowed me to grasp the spatial features of Tsushima's coastal area. Analysis of the GIS information clarified areas of algae distribution, assisting predictions of fish habitation areas. This helped determine marine areas that should be protected. 2. We confirmed the influence of the tides on the warm Tsushima current, and observed upwelling on site. Considering three-dimensional marine structure is thought to enable the determination of effective protection areas in MPA design.",0,2013,,WOS:000410345100029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations,

Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo:Pacific for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and fishing pressure that will influence the fisheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management benefits are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low fishing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term fisheries management or conservation goals.

The workshop concluded that although fisheries managers and biodiversity conservation agencies may give differing and sometimes opposing weights to the many objectives that could be set for MPAs, only 25% of fisheries objectives and 30% of biodiversity objectives were considered to be potential sources of conflict. MPAs that segregate activities in space could contribute to resolving all but one of the potential conflicts over objectives associated with desired ecological outcomes. Conflicts over social or economic objectives could be improved, made worse, or not be affected by MPAs, depending on how the MPAs were developed and managed. Seven features of planning processes and six features of the governance processes for MPAs were identified that could help find broadly supported solutions to the conflicts that did occur. Once established, the management of the MPA should be inclusive and participatory, as well as continuously learning and adaptive. Approaches to ensure management had those properties were identified, including twelve specific mechanisms that should be available to the MPA managers. On the basis of these conclusions about objectives, planning, and management, a general framework for the governance of MPAs for both fisheries and biodiversity conservation was developed. Its ten general characteristics and twelve steps necessary for progress were identified. We discuss the special challenges of establishing and managing MPAs for fisheries and biodiversity conservation on the high seas that deserve further attention include information-sharing, coordination and defining jurisdictions and stake-holding.

The objective of the paper is to maximize the net economic revenue earn from the fishery through implementing the sustainable properties of the fishery to keep the ecological balance. Biological measures are introduced to increase the understanding of the mechanisms in the bioeconomic system. The importance of marine reserve is analyzed through the obtained results of the numerical simulations of proposed model system. The results depict that reserves will be most effective when coupled with harvesting controls in adjacent fisheries. The paper also incorporates the induced cost and premium from establishing a marine protected area in a fishery. It is found that premium of marine protected area (MPA) increases with the increasing size of the reserve. Results are analyzed with the help of graphical illustrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

For example, no-take fishing areas can be impractical in regions where people rely heavily on reef fish for food. In this study we test whether coral reef health differed among areas with varying management practices and socio-economic conditions on Pulau Weh in the Indonesian province of Aceh. Our results show that gear restrictions, in particular prohibiting the use of nets, were successful in minimizing habitat degradation and maintaining fish biomass despite ongoing access to the fishery. Reef fish biomass and hard-coral cover were two-to eight-fold higher at sites where fishing nets were prohibited. The guiding principle of the local customary management system, Panglima Laot, is to reduce conflict among community members over access to marine resources. Consequently, conservation benefits in Aceh have arisen from a customary system that lacks a specific environmental ethic or the means for strong resource-based management. Panglima Laot includes many of the features of successful institutions, such as clearly defined membership rights and the opportunity for resource users to be involved in making, enforcing and changing the rules. Such mechanisms to reduce conflict are the key to the success of marine resource management, particularly in settings that lack resources for enforcement.",19,2012,10.1017/S0030605312000348,WOS:000309472600008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms,

For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas.

This is one of the first studies to assess the efficacy of using education and outreach activities to improve community knowledge and attitudes about an MPA. Random sample surveys in 2005 and 2010 (n=1213) before and after education and outreach activities are compared. Program budgets for the same period give the investment levels. With an investment level averaging US$24 per capita/year, the result was an average increase of 33% in yes responses across 15 indicators of knowledge and attitudes towards marine conservation. The increase in knowledge and positive attitudes was associated with a large decrease in not sure responses, suggesting that community members with fewer initial preconceptions are the most effective target for education and outreach activities. This study demonstrates that investments in MPA education and outreach can generate increases in local knowledge and positive attitudes, and changing knowledge and attitudes is expected to contribute to the long-term compliance with MPA regulations.

A global analysis of marine reserve regulations,MARINE POLICY,,"Marine reserves are places where wildlife and habitats are protected from extractive and depositional uses of the sea. Although considered to be the pinnacle in marine conservation, many permit non-consumptive activities with little or no regulation. This paper examines the potential impacts of 16 non-consumptive activities including scuba diving, sailing, scientific research and motor boating, and how they might compromise the conservation objectives of marine reserves. Examination of 91 marine reserves from 36 countries found little agreement or consistency in what non-consumptive activities are permitted in marine reserves and how they are regulated. The two most common activities allowed without regulation were swimming (mentioned in 80% of marine reserves and allowed in 63% of these) and kayaking (mentioned in 85%, allowed in 53%). Scuba diving was mentioned in 91% and allowed without regulation in 41%. A risk score for the likely level of threat to wildlife and/or habitats that each activity could produce was then assigned based on effects reported in the literature. The risk analysis suggests that motor boating and activities which include or require it have a high potential to negatively impact wildlife and habitats if inadequately managed. Hence protection against extractive or depositional activities alone is insufficient to secure the high standard of protection usually assumed in marine reserves. For this to be achieved activities typically considered as benign must receive appropriate management, especially with increasing recreational use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Collaborative conservation initiatives that engage stakeholders in action research and knowledge co-production processes can enhance management and governance of MPAs. To design effective strategies aimed at reconciling biodiversity conservation and management of sustainable human uses, it is key to assess how local communities respond to such initiatives and identify the set of contextual factors, institutional, local and individual, potentially affecting these responses. This paper presents the approach and results of one such initiative, spanning 6 EU countries and 11 MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on small-scale fishers as key MPA users. Through a collaborative project, managers and fishers agreed upon specific governance interventions (e.g. increasing stakeholder engagement, engaging fishers in monitoring activities, reducing fishing efforts) to be implemented in each MPA for one year. Structured surveys queried: MPA managers on the MPA context, governance structure, feasibility and effectiveness of the tested interventions; and small-scale fishers on their perceptions of the impact of the tested interventions on a set of 9 socio-ecological variables (e.g. amount of fish caught, level of participation in decision-making, support for the MPA).

We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of similar to 4% higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43% greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season.",34,2012,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00422.x,WOS:000302610400002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,design,

S.; Connolly, Sean R.; Mapstone, Bruce D.",Effects of sex change on the implications of marine reserves for fisheries,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,"Marine reserves have become widely used in biodiversity conservation and are increasingly proposed as fisheries management tools. Previous modeling studies have found that reserves may increase or decrease yields, depending on local environmental conditions and on the specific life-history traits of the fishery species. Sex-changing (female-to-male) fish are targets of some of the most important commercial and recreational fisheries in the world. The potential for disproportionate removal of the larger, older sex of such species requires new theory to facilitate our understanding of how reserves will affect the yields of surrounding fisheries, relative to fishes with separate sexes. We investigated this question by modeling the effects of marine reserves on a non-sex-changing and a sex-changing population. We used demographic parameter estimates for the common coral trout as a baseline, and we conducted extensive sensitivity analyses to determine how sustainable yields of sex-changing species are likely to be affected by reserves across a broad range of life-history parameters. Our findings indicate that fisheries for sex-changing species are unlikely to receive the same yield-enhancing benefit that non-sex-changing fisheries enjoy from marine reserves, and that often reserves tend to reduce sustainable yields for a given overall population size. Specifically, the increased egg production and high fertilization success within reserves is more than offset by the reduced egg production and fertilization success in the fished areas, relative to a system in which fishing mortality is distributed more evenly over the entire system. A key reason for this appears to be that fertilization success is reduced, on average, when males are unevenly distributed among subpopulations, as is the case when reserves are present. These findings suggests that, for sex-changing populations, reserves are more suited to rebuilding overfished populations and sustaining fishery viability, rather than enhancing fishery yields. These results are robust over a range of sex-change regimes, stock-recruitment relationships, adult mortality rates, individual growth strategies, and fertilization-success functions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the different contributions of males and females to population growth and fishery yields when evaluating the efficacy of marine reserves for enhancement of fished species.",16,2012,10.1890/11-0036.1,WOS:000303312000004,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

We used a novel data set of daily self-reported boating destinations from emergency rescue logbooks for a recreational angling community from 2000 to 2008. Because the reserve system has no experimental control, we modeled the data two ways to test for robustness to model specification. We tested for changes in human fishing behavior with regression and fit a fleet-level discrete choice model to project a counterfactual scenario. The counterfactual is the statistically constructed ex post expectation of the human behavior we would have observed if the reserve never existed. We included month and year fixed effects in our models to account for seasonal and interannual fluctuations in fishing behavior and catch rates. We detected a decrease in reserve use compared to the counterfactual, indicating that the reserve rapidly experienced a decrease in visitation. However, the reserve's effect to reduce trips diminished with time. These results indicate that the reserve is unlikely to meet its ecological goals without institutional changes that enhance compliance. This illustrates the value of human use data to understanding the processes underlying marine reserve function. We suggest that managers should consider human use with the same frequency, rigor, and tools as they do fishery stocks.

Moreover, their perceptions may be relevant for monitoring the effects of MPAs on extractive activities. This study analyzes artisanal fishers' perceptions of the performance of a north-western Mediterranean coastal MPA, which encompasses two no-take zones (NTZs). Three viewpoints have been considered: the effect on the personal activity of fishers, the effect on the local fishery and the effect on the ecosystem. In order to test the hypothesis that biomass export (spillover) - which had previously been evidenced from the two NTZs - may influence fishers' perceptions of NTZ effects, fishers' perceptions were compared with both declared and observed fishing activity over an one-year period. The results show that negative perceptions of NTZs are either nil or are negligible. Most fishers are aware of the beneficial effects of NTZs on ecosystems and fisheries. However, they remain to be convinced of the beneficial effects of the NTZs on their own activity. For instance, the proximity of a NTZ appears never to be involved in the choice of a fishing spot. This partial lack of correspondence between scientific expectation and fishers' perceptions is discussed in the light of fishing habits in the zone adjacent to NTZs, and takes into account fishing grounds, targeted species and seniority (defined as the number of years the fisher has been fishing within the MPA). All three factors appear to influence fishers' perceptions. For example, having a positive perception about a NTZ and spending more time fishing in the adjacent zone are habits that can be associated with fishers with less seniority. Fishers' perceptions obviously indicate the social acceptance of the MPA and are an essential monitoring tool for MPA managers. However, perceptions cannot be seen as a substitute for scientific monitoring, as both approaches are clearly complementary.

Ineffective social assessment can alienate local communities and undermine the success of existing and future MPAs. It is rare to critique the success of methods used currently to incorporate social and economic considerations into MPA planning. Three Australian MPA planning processes covering three states and incorporating federal and state jurisdictions are reviewed in order to determine how potential social impacts were assessed and considered. These case studies indicate that Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is under-developed in Australian MPA planning. Assessments rely heavily on public participation and economic modelling as surrogates for dedicated SIA and are followed commonly by attitudinal surveys to gauge public opinion on the MPA after its establishment. The emergence of issues around public perception of the value of MPAs indicates the failure of some of these proposals to adequately consider social factors in planning and management. This perception may have potential implications for the long term success of individual MPAs. It may also compromise Australia's ability to meet international commitments for MPA targets to gazette at least 10% of all its marine habitats as MPAs. Indeed, this is demonstrated in two of the three case studies where social and economic arguments against MPAs have been used to delay or block the future expansion of the MPA network.

We conducted a simulation study to determine the effects of MPAs on accuracy of surplus production model (SPM) stock assessments. We simulated the dynamics of a population that had part of its range in an MPA, and we assessed the population with spatially aggregated and spatially explicit SPMs under a range of conditions, including different MPA sizes (percentage of the total stock area), different rates of migration between MPA and non-MPA regions, and scenarios with high and low observation error in the indices of abundance. We also considered a scenario in which there was no available index of abundance within the MPA. We used the median of the absolute value of relative error and the median relative error from 200 replicates/scenario to test SPM accuracy. In most cases, spatially explicit SPMs performed better in both accuracy and bias than spatially aggregated SPMs. The accuracy of the assessments also increased as MPA size increased except under the scenario of no index of abundance within the MPA; for that scenario, accuracy increased as MPA size decreased.

We use the conceptualization and operationalization of social resilience proposed by Marshall and Marshall (2007) to investigate how resilience level influenced commercial fishers' perceptions about and adaptation to the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 114 commercial and charter fishers to measure their social resilience level and their responses and adaptation strategies to the 2004 zoning plan. Fishers with higher resilience were more likely to believe that the zoning plan was necessary, more likely to be supportive of the plan, and more likely to have adapted their fishing business and fishing activity to the plan than were fishers with lower social resilience. High-resilience fishers were also less likely to perceive negative impacts of the plan on their fishing business, less likely to have negative attitudes toward the consultation process used to develop and implement the plan, and less likely to have applied for financial compensation under the structural adjustment program. Results confirm the utility of the social resilience construct for identifying fishers who are likely to be vulnerable to changes, and those who are struggling to cope with change events. We conclude that managing for social resilience in the GBR would aid in the design and implementation of policies that minimize the impacts on resource users and lead to more inclusive and sustainable management, but that further research is necessary to better understand social resilience, how it can be fostered and sustained, and how it can be effectively incorporated into management.",15,2012,10.5751/ES-04966-170306,WOS:000309475800025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not impacts of MPA,

A low perceived importance of MPAs as a place to recreate and low interest in engagement was also apparent. However, there was significant support for additional MPA regulation. The results demonstrate the complexity of engaging with recreation users in a country where MPAs are a relatively recent concept superimposed on well-established and historically settled human uses.

J.",Socio-economic value and community benefits from shark-diving tourism in Palau: A sustainable use of reef shark populations,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,,"Arguments for conservation of sharks based on their role in the maintenance of healthy marine ecosystems have failed to halt the worldwide decline in populations. Instead, the value of sharks as a fishery commodity has severely reduced the abundance of these animals. Conservation may be assisted by the development of an alternative approach that emphasizes the economic value of sharks as a non-harvested resource. Our study quantifies the value of a tourism industry based on shark diving. Using data collected from surveys, as well as government statistics, we show that shark diving is a major contributor to the economy of Palau, generating US$18 million per year and accounting for approximately 8% of the gross domestic product of the country. Annually, shark diving was responsible for the disbursement of US$1.2 million in salaries to the local community, and generated US$1.5 million in taxes to the government. If the population of approximately 100 sharks that interact with tourists at popular dive sites was harvested by fishers, their economic value would be at most US$10 800, a fraction of the worth of these animals as a non-consumptive resource. Fishers earn more selling fish for consumption by shark divers than they would gain by catching sharks. Shark diving provides an attractive economic alternative to shark fishing, with distribution of revenues benefiting several sectors of the economy, stimulating the development and generating high revenues to the government, while ensuring the ecological sustainability of shark populations.

Using 28 data sets from seven MPAs in Southern Europe, we developed a meta-analytical approach to investigate the effects of protection on adjacent fisheries and asking how these effects are influenced by MPA size and age. Southern European MPAs showed clear effects on the surrounding fisheries, on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of target species, but especially on the CPUE of the marketable catch. These effects depended on the time of protection and on the size of the no-take area. CPUE of both target species and the marketable catch increased gradually by 24% per year over a long time period (at least 30 years). The influence of the size of the no-take area appeared to be more complex. The catch rates of the entire fishery in and around the MPA were higher when the no-take areas were smaller. Conversely, catch rates of selected fisheries that were expected to benefit most from protection increased when the no-take area was larger.

Declines in fish stocks have resulted in greater concerns for food security, especially in developing and coastal areas, and calls for environmental conservation are growing. Planning of marine protected areas has traditionally been based on biological and ecological data, only recently focusing on the human communities that are significantly dependent on coastal resources. The hypothesis that marine resource use is determined by socioeconomic factors (such as food security and income) and livelihood options was tested in two communities on the island of Rodrigues (Western Indian Ocean). As livelihood development can be a response to fisher displacement by protected areas, willingness towards alternative livelihood options and the differences in this between fisher demographic groups were also examined. Using semi-structured interviews, 72 fishers were surveyed on topics such as fishery and marine protected area (MPA) regulation noncompliance, current livelihoods and willingness to consider alternative livelihoods. Fishers believed Rodrigues fisheries suffer from high levels of noncompliance, owing mainly to a lack of livelihood alternatives and depleted stocks. Rodriguan fishers had low mobility, both within the fishery (for example gear types used and target species) and in movement to occupations outside the fishery. The fishers were generally willing to consider alternate livelihoods. Age was significantly correlated with overall willingness to consider alternative work, while gender and village were found to have a significant relationship with types of work that an individual was willing to consider. Policy makers and marine resource managers need to identify drivers of noncompliant behaviour and examine livelihood preferences at different scales (individual, within and between communities) prior to users being affected by MPA created displacement to more effectively address marine conservation and food security goals. The findings offer new empirical evidence to strengthen support for arguments that could be made by policy makers to demand more balanced consideration of the effects of MPAs on socioeconomic factors along with environmental considerations in communities highly dependent on access to the marine areas that will be affected by MPAs.",27,2011,10.1017/S0376892911000178,WOS:000296086500008,field,perception,,MPA,Riviere Banane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,flexibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angler behavior is described using econometrically estimated site choice models, with site choice among anglers driven by site attributes and angler characteristics. The biophysical model represents the marine reef environment as a system with different trophic levels identifying algal and coral growth as well as two types of fish (piscivores and herbivores). Ecosystem dynamics are driven by interactions within the trophic levels and interaction between fish populations and fishing activities. The model is used to simulate recreational fishing activities and their interactions with the environment. Recreational fishing sites from the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia, are used as a case study. A set of management strategies, including business-as-usual and different site closure durations, are assessed for two different levels of fishing pressures. The results show that not only the effectiveness but also the distribution of management impacts across space and over time can be very different from what one would expect without the benefit of integrated modeling.

T.; Plaganyi, Eva E.",Protecting old fish through spatial management: is there a benefit for sustainable exploitation?,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,"1. Spatially defined restrictions on fishing activity are considered to be important for biodiversity conservation in marine ecosystems. However, it is uncertain whether such restrictions also benefit wider populations of exploited fish species, in terms of a reduced risk of overexploitation. Since fishing leads to contraction of the age structure, one potential benefit of protection is recovery of the highly fecund older age classes, potentially leading to higher recruitment levels. This investigation explores the benefits of protecting older fish and how spatial management can be used to adjust the age structure and improve the sustainability of the catch (productivity). 2. We use a non-spatial equilibrium model accounting for biomass growth, mortality and recruitment to describe the relationship between mean age of the population and productivity for the South African deepwater hake Merluccius paradoxus trawl fishery. Our results indicate that management measures capable of increasing the mean age at which fish are caught may be of benefit. Furthermore, although the contribution of older fish to recruitment is important, the biomass growth of individuals before they are caught is responsible for the most significant productivity benefit of an older population age structure. 3. Older M. paradoxus are found in deeper water, so that distinct age classes can be defined spatially using empirical data. We describe a non-equilibirum model to examine spatial management alternatives for adjusting the age structure by targetting these different age classes. We investigate the benefits of protecting either older or younger fish, with results suggesting that it is more important to limit fishing on the younger (shallow) sections of the population if productivity benefits are to be realized. 4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the age structure of a population can be modified through spatially managed targeting of different age classes, and that, contrary to previous assumptions for M. paradoxus, protecting older fish has a negative consequence for the age structure of the resource. Instead, younger sections of the population should be protected through limitations on fishing in shallower waters, if older age classes are to recover.",15,2011,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01961.x,WOS:000292331100005,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

MPAs are a common conservation and fisheries management tool in this area, but the relationship between gendered fishing practices and participatory MPA management is rarely considered. In this region, women and men's fishing practices are often socially and ecologically distinct. MPAs are found in both intertidal and subtidal areas where women and men tend to fish respectively. Based on over 500 interviews in 12 fishing communities, MPAs were largely perceived to be a management tool for men's fishing. Very few men and women reported a negative effect on their personal fishing or displacement from their fishing area. However, in two communities MPAs that had been in intertidal areas had either been moved or opened specifically to allow for gleaning.

The establishment of MPAs has increased greatly in recent years mostly due to international commitments to the establishment of a global network of MPAs by 2012. MPAs have the potential to strongly affect the fishing industry, and their success depends, at least partly, on fishers' attitudes towards this management measure. However, research on MPAs tends to focus on the ecological and conservation aspects of this management approach and not on its human dimensions. Studies in attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and preferences related to MPA issues have been identified as priority social science topics in need of research. We present a 'rapid review', conducted systematically, of the literature published up to September 2009 and aimed at identifying the most investigated topics related to commercial fishers' attitudes towards MPAs, describing the main findings from these studies, and analysing the implications for management. Most published work focuses on fishers' attitudes towards issues of governance, conservation of biodiversity and the environment, and the impact of MPAs on fishing activity. Despite the recent increase in the literature on the human dimensions of MPAs, the present review reveals that little of this literature originates from empirical studies.

We used the National Marine Park of Alonissos, Northern Sporades (NMPANS), Greece, as a relevant case-study to investigate whether the local print media's framing of the marine park and its management affected locals' attitudes. We conducted a longitudinal review of local newspaper articles pertaining to the NMPANS during 1980-2008, and we conducted telephone interviews with local people. We found that salience of the NMPANS in the local print media remained limited and sporadic, the main stakeholder remained the centralized public sector, and the regional print media was rather detached, moderate, and largely supportive of the NMPANS throughout 1980-2008. The progression of the management periods of the NMPANS, however, was accompanied by increased importance of the NMPANS, increased deviance from conservation as the chief objective of the NMPANS's establishment, a shift from presenting facts to presenting reactions, and a shift from a positive to a mixed image of the NMPANS. Locals who relied on newspapers for local news were better informed about the NMPANS, more likely to accept the NMPANS, and more likely to participate in meetings regarding the NMPANS regardless of gender, age, and occupation than those who did not rely on newspapers.

We used a fishing community in Kubulau District, Fiji to demonstrate this method. We modelled opportunity costs as a function of food fish abundance and probability of catch, based on gear type and market value of species. Count models (including Poisson, negative binomial and two zero-inflated models) were used to predict spatial abundance of preferred target fish species and were validated against field surveys. A profit model was used to investigate the effect of restricted access to transport on costs to fishers. Spatial distributions of fish within the three most frequently sighted food fish families (Acanthuridae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae) varied, with greatest densities of Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae on barrier forereefs and greatest densities of Scaridae on submerged reefs. Modelled opportunity cost indicated that highest costs to fishers arise from restricting access to the barrier forereefs. We included our opportunity cost model in Marxan, a decision support tool used for MPA design, to examine potential MPA configurations for Kubulau District, Fiji Islands. We identified optimum areas for protection in Kubulau with: (a) the current MPA network locked in place; and (b) a clean-slate approach.

Fish biomass had a greater and more consistent response to protection than coral cover. Human population density had a strong positive association with the response of fish biomass, which was driven by lower biomass outside marine protected areas (MPAs) in high human population density sites, rather than higher biomass within MPAs. Perceived infringement was negatively associated with the absolute and response ratio of fish biomass. Coral cover was variable, weakly related to closure, and positively related to closure size and human population density.

This article presents the socioeconomic baselines and synthetic measures of recreational fishers' social acceptance. Recreational boat fishers' perceptions toward the NMR, current strategies, and territorial stakes were identified through fifty interviews. This led to five synthetic measures of social acceptance and the differentiation of five different groups of recreational fishers in terms of their uses opinions. The five groups of recreational fishers differed considerably in regards to three key aspects of social acceptance. However, local geography played little role in social acceptance, with views being relatively uniform across the three main ports.",2,2011,10.1080/08920753.2011.589222,WOS:000299927200006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PDF not found

In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), MPA networks are being created to meet top-down, internationally defined MPA targets, while simultaneously there is a strong regional focus on bottom-up, community-based marine management. These apparently contradictory trends can be bridged through networks of community-based MPAs. To explore whether institutional interplay affects the success of such MPA networks, and to provide guidance for MPA-making in the WIO, the literature on ten geographically diverse MPA networks with community-based MPAs was reviewed. Because this is a first exploration into the topic, not all causal links between institutional interplay and MPA effectiveness could be confirmed, neither was any indication of interplay-related costs found. However, the analysis suggests that institutional interplay is generally concerned with information exchanges and issues of control and authority and seemed to have positive effects on MPA success. As MPA networks expand in the WIO, MPA practitioners and managers in the region may consider different forms of institutional interplay to be tailored to their specific management and financial contexts.",10,2011,10.1080/08920753.2011.589214,WOS:000299927200007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not impacts of MPA,

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the main measure currently in place, are criticised for displaying limited success due to inherent disadvantages (their large size makes MPAs hard to finance, manage and police; while the restrictions and loss of income they impose, cause local communities to be hostile to their presence). A new institutional tool is required that will ensure sustainable marine conservation without burdening State budgets, and create alternative income sources and development opportunities for locals. Measures that would meet these requirements should be applicable by the State and in line with the polluter pays principle, but still present advantages to those called upon to bear their cost. We propose a form of Marine Impact Trade (MIT), which would allow a State to offset marine environmental impact, caused by any sector of the economy, with marine protection activities, advantageous to those who have to implement them, while also benefiting local communities to an even greater extent; thus rendering such measures affordable to the payers and welcomed by the locals. We propose a pilot MET application using the novel concept of Diving Parks (small self-financed and sustainable marine no-take areas, dedicated to recreational diving, already proven to rapidly restore and sustainably protect the marine environment). These Diving Parks, initially financed by polluters and run by them hand-in-hand with local entrepreneurs and communities, shall provide immediate and effective marine environmental rejuvenation and sustainable conservation. Additionally, this offers an opportunity: (a) for polluters/payers to display social responsibility and even make a profit (instead of a loss), and (b) for local societies to reap the benefits of an impressive development in tourism and related activities, cultivating local environmental consciousness and pride. A centrally monitored network of such scattered self-sustained Diving Parks, for which we have coined the term Socially Sustainable MPAs (SoS MPAs), can extend to establish and provide effective ongoing biodiversity protection to a large number of marine locations.",0,2011,,WOS:000315976500026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations/design,

This study explores the human dimensions of MPA planning in Mozambique by engaging local resource users in a series of structured discussions about marine resource use, pressures on marine resources, ways to address such pressures, and the potential positive and negative impacts of MPAs on the management of marine resources and livelihoods, from a community perspective. Findings show that the groups and communities interviewed are at best ambivalent towards MPAs while at the same time supporting increased government regulation, including conventional fisheries management measures. The study suggests that without significant community involvement in the choice of marine conservation tools, the drive to establish MPAs to achieve biodiversity conservation and tourism development goals may be counterproductive, at least in terms of poverty alleviation and sustainable resource use. It argues that a wider range of marine conservation approaches and tools needs to be considered in addition to MPAs, taking into consideration local views and institutional capacities.

The second involved the search for patterns in geomorphology and its association to the biology of exploited species. Using diverse and patchy sets of data including published peer-reviewed papers, gray literature reports from Belize and other Caribbean nations, remotely sensed images, coarse bathymetric maps, new bathymetric data collected with a single-beam sonar, and reports of fishermen from various parts of the country, we developed a conceptual understanding summarized by the multispecies promontory hypothesis, which suggests a common geomorphology of spawning sites for most large and commercially important reef fish species.

By stipulating the minimum area of fishing grounds that must remain open to each local fishing community, we were able to design MPA networks that impacted local resource users more equitably and were therefore more likely to be socioeconomically viable. MPA networks that considered local tenure boundaries had a greater overall area and cost than those that sought to minimize costs to small-scale fishers as a single stakeholder group. However, in this context, established concepts of efficiency in conservation planning are likely to be less important than minimizing costs to each fishing community individually.",36,2010,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00131.x,WOS:000284893700009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendation/design,

This study investigates how the ecological performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines, Caribbean, and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is related to both reserve design features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the reserve relative to nearby areas. Of the socioeconomic variables considered, human population density and compliance with reserve rules had the strongest effects on fish biomass, but the effects of these variables were region specific. Relationships between population density and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean, positive in the WIO, and not detectable in the Philippines. Differing associations between population density and reserve effectiveness defy simple explanation but may depend on human migration to effective reserves, depletion of fish stocks outside reserves, or other social factors that change with population density. Higher levels of compliance reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in reserves compared with outside, but this relationship was only statistically significant in the Caribbean. A heuristic model based on correlations between social, cultural, political, economic, and other contextual conditions in 127 marine reserves showed that high levels of compliance with reserve rules were related to complex social interactions rather than simply to enforcement of reserve rules. Comparative research of this type is important for uncovering the complexities surrounding human dimensions of marine reserves and improving reserve management.",214,2010,10.1073/pnas.0908266107,WOS:000283677400011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,compliance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other social mechanism (compliance),

Indeed, implementation of an MPA in a coastal region will likely affect fishing communities along that coast but to differing degrees depending on their location relative to the MPA. The resulting creation of winners and losers has implications for the acceptance and long-term viability of the MPA. This paper develops a spatially explicit bioeconomic simulation model to assess the distributional implications resulting from creation of a no-take MPA. The key assumption is that this results in certain fishers being displaced from the MPA to new fishing locations, leading to decreased fishing time and increased costs. Is it possible for those being displaced to end up as winners in the fishery? Analysis of the model indicates that such an outcome can occur in certain circumstances, notably if the biological effects of the MPA produce (i) improved ecosystem health inside the MPA, such that fish stock carrying capacity increases; or (ii) to some extent, high fish stock migration rates between neighboring areas. The results indicate that in creating MPAs, careful attention to their design is needed in order to deal with corresponding distributional impacts on fishing communities.",7,2010,,WOS:000277168600005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,design/recommendations,

The influence of a number of factors, including socio-economic characteristics, perception of coral resources state of health and attitudes towards non-compliance with regulations are analysed. During May 2006, 640 questionnaires were distributed to school children around Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean, for completion by their parents, following an informal educational activity made in school. From a 73% (n = 469) response rate, results showed that 78% of participants were in favour of the MPA. Analysis further identified that those supportive of the MPA were generally from higher socio-professional categories, had a negative perception of the coral reef ecosystem's health and were not originally from Reunion. In contrast, locals (born in Reunion) from lower socio-professional categories or with no employment activity and having a positive perception of the health status of coral reefs offered no opinion on the MPA. Attitudes towards enforcement and compliance highlighted that SCUBA divers, fishers and jet skiers attributed a higher value to the protection of the coral reef environment through enforcement of MPA regulations than to their own use of the coral reef resource. When asked about the use of penalties to deter non-compliance, swimmers were awarded the lowest fines, followed by SCUBA divers, fishers then jet skiers being awarded the highest fines. Thus, the more severe the act of non-compliance by a resource user group was perceived to be, the more these users themselves disapproved of non-compliant behaviour and supported use of high penalties. The survey design through focusing on school children's parents, demonstrated a simple and cost-effective method for data collection while providing environmental education, which could be employed in similar case studies elsewhere.

The overall poor performance of MPAs can be traced to a failure to effectively include local communities in the design and implementation of relevant measures. Recent efforts have incorporated aspects of community-based management into a hybrid form of management, which ideally builds upon existing local management practices. A key challenge lies in the development of appropriate frameworks that allow for the successful participation of local communities in management. A review of studies on MPA design and community-based marine resource management and fieldwork observations provides suggestions on how to address current socioeconomic shortcomings in MPA design and implementation, successfully involving local communities in order to provide a better local basis for effective larger MPA networks.

Compared to non-fishers, fishers were poorer, had higher occupational diversity, more participation in community decision-making, and higher scores on six dimensions of knowledge about marine resources. Fishers living adjacent parks had lower occupational diversity, higher fortnightly expenditures. greater knowledge of the effects of land-based pollutants and market demands than non-park fishers. These relationships may, however, be a result of urbanization near Kenya's marine parks, rather than the marine parks' effect on fishers' knowledge and livelihoods. Consistent with studies from other parts of the world, this study finds that there are aspects of Kenyan fishers' socioeconomic conditions and knowledge about the sea that characterize them as distinct from non-fishers.

The information was collected over the 2006-2007 period by means of interviews aimed at surveying fleet features, fishing gear used, catch and socio-economic data. Aeolian fishery is characterized by small polyvalent boats (n = 157, ranging from 4.5 to 15.8 m). The highest CPUE values were reported for Thunnus alolunga (50.62 +/- 25.79 kg/1000 hooks*day) caught by albacore drifting longline in the fall season, Scorpaena scrofa (0.69 +/- 0.51 kg/500 m net*day) by trammel net in summer and Todarodes sagittatus (8.35 +/- 2.55 kg/day) by squid hand jig line in winter. The catch is traded in both the wholesale and the retail market. Since the spadara driftnet ban, this fishery has undergone changes that are still in progress and that are leading to a greater polyvalence and seasonality of fishing activities.

Yet currently, less than 1% of the global oceans are protected, although international agreements have targets ranging from 10-30% coverage. Despite its minuscule size, we consider the current MPA network to be beneficial to fisheries, and its running or maintenance cost, therefore, to be a positive contribution to the sustainability of fisheries, or a beneficial subsidy (harmful subsidies enhance fishing capacity and effort). A method was derived from data in Balmford et al. (PNAS, 101: 9694-9697) to estimate the annual cost of maintaining MPAs as a function of their size, and of the degree of development of the country in question. We provide national costs of the 53 countries that jointly contribute 95% of global fisheries catch and, assuming that this type of subsidy, in a given country, cannot exceed 15% of the ex-vessel value of its fisheries catches, estimated a global MPA subsidy to fisheries of 870 million US$.

Respondents identified multiple MPA objectives, the most frequently mentioned of which was restoring and sustaining fish populations. The results suggest that MPA age accounts for the greatest level of variation across communities. When unconstrained, progress in enforcement was identified as a key indicator among respondents from younger MPAs while respondents from older MPAs identified increased fish abundance and catch. Although consensus can be reached more easily under constrained conditions, the results derived from unconstrained methods are more revealing of the needs and aspirations of communities.

Although marine and coastal environments attract many people and are vitally important in terms of realized and potential social value, the majority of the public in the United Kingdom lacks understanding and awareness regarding them. Combined with this, the social value of marine and coastal protected areas (MCPAs) have been largely ignored relative to conservation and economics, with the latter invariably taking precedence in environmental policymaking. Social value reflects the complex, individual responses that people experience in a given place. Many reasons determine why one area is valued above another, and this research investigates the social value of MCPAs from a practitioner's perspective through a series of interviews. Understanding why we socially value MCPAs will ultimately equip managers with an informed understanding of these spaces, influence management decisions, and, potentially, policymaking.

Results indicate that a small majority of recreational boaters support the concept of marine zoning, but that there are areas of concern that ought to be addressed as MPA implementation proceeds. Support for zoning was strongly related to perceived benefits, particularly environmental benefits. Furthermore, perceived benefits overall were found to outweigh concerns as determinants of recreational boater support for zoning.

Because the recruitment effect is difficult to detect, spillover is presently the only tangible potential fishery benefit of MPAs. Despite abundant evidence of spillover in the literature, this is the first study to quantify the number and biomass of individuals annually spilling over from an MPA and their contribution to the local fishery catches. Using a decade (1997-2007) of tag-recapture data for the lobster Palinurus elephas from the Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (CIMR), we estimated annual emigration probabilities of 3.7% (female) and 6.7% (male), and quantified the resulting spillover to adjacent fished areas. We showed that during an 8 to 17 yr protection period, harvested spillover offset the loss of yield resulting from the reduction of fishing grounds set aside in the CIMR, producing a mean annual net benefit of 10% of the catch in weight. Although the number of lobsters spilling over annually did not quite make up for the loss of fishing grounds in the CIMR, it did in weight because the mean size of the lobsters emigrating from the reserve was larger than that of those outside. We propose that nomadic or home range movements of individuals near MPA boundaries, seasonal migrations and migrations forced by extraordinary meteorological events, and density-dependent movements facilitated spillover from the CIMR.

The MPAs that meet narrowly defined biological goals are generally presented as successes. However, these same MPAs may, in fact, be social failures when social evaluation criteria are applied. A review of four MPAs in the Philippines and Indonesia demonstrates this scenario. The cases are reviewed using standard measures of biological and social success. Their historic and present management structures are reviewed. It is suggested that a strong linkage exists between social and biological success, with social considerations determining long-term biological success.

This paper studies the less-documented transition of the island during the late 1990s from community-based management to centralised national state management. Extensive interviewing of islanders has revealed deep misgivings about the centralised regime-the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB). PAMB's aim of implementing the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems (NIPAS) Act was initially looked upon favourably by islanders, but it has lost that support because of its exclusion of stakeholders from management and its poor institutional performance. The paper's conclusion is that the implementation of the NIPAS Act highlights the limitations of top-down management, and that there is a need to restore an element of local stakeholder participation in the governance of Apo's marine protected area (MPA). A system of co-management between community and national state actors is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of Apo's marine resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, inadequate funding often prevents these management regimes from fulfilling their missions. Managers have become increasingly aware that successful protection of marine ecosystems is dependent not only upon an understanding of their biological and physical processes, but also their associated social and economic aspects. Unfortunately, economic values associated with MPAs and the natural resources they protect are rarely considered in decision-making and policy development. This study addresses this information gap by examining scuba divers' willingness to pay for access to quality recreational sites in the Bonaire National Marine Park, Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. The findings indicate that the US$10 annual diver user fee in effect at the time of the study could be increased substantially without a significant adverse effect on island tourism. Depending on question format, mean willingness to pay for annual access ranged from US$61 to US$134 (2002$). All model specifications support the conclusion that doubling the US$10 user fee would have virtually no impact on visitation rates. The increased revenue generated from this sustainable financing mechanism is more than sufficient to fund both current and enhanced marine park operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This work is part of a larger network of projects on ICM through the participatory Coastal Community University Research Alliance. The implementation of ICM with full community involvement is a challenge, for example: communities are not unified or homogenous units, power varies among stakeholders, and silo constructs and turf wars discourage involvement of the wider public. In 2007, a survey of nine community-based organizations and associations and a First Nation community, located within the Annapolis Basin and surrounding areas of the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of Fundy was conducted. The purpose of the survey was to better understand how the concept of ICM is conceptualized and acted upon by local communities and to draw upon this to enrich ICM theory. Approximately 30 projects representing community-based ICM initiatives over the last 10 years were identified, including: capacity building, habitat and stock enhancement/management programs and responses to new policies or legislative interventions. Several enabling and constraining factors for community involvement in ICM were identified. One key finding is a major difference between community and government approaches. Government ICM initiatives have captured some aspects of the environmental and economic management issues, but have generally failed to consider cultural and social components. They have also failed to take into account the interconnections within and between human and ecological systems. Community members report that government is more interested in forming partnerships with the corporate sector than with the people who rely on local resources. From the community perspective, dealing with the resulting power imbalances must involve revisiting the core values that underpin regulation and resource exploitation. This study demonstrates that communities are usually the first responders for many ecological problems, and there is a willingness to take responsibility for the management of resources. ICM is already embedded in on-going community projects, networks and forums. These initiatives promote the principles identified in Canada's Oceans Act and Oceans Strategy, but the relevant government agencies have provided little support to them. ICM has the potential to bring together many issues that can be addressed by the multi-stakeholder process, but this needs to be facilitated by on-going government collaborations, contributions and recognition.

Marine reserves are a popular tool for managing coastal ecosystems and resources yet surprisingly few studies have quantified the social-economic impacts of marine reserves on food security despite the critical importance of this outcome for fisheries management in developing countries. Here, I conducted semi-structured household surveys with 113 women heads-of-households to investigate the influence of two old, well-enforced, no-take marine reserves on food security in four coastal fishing communities in Kenya, East Africa. Multi-model information-theoretic inference and matching methods found that marine reserves did not influence household food security, as measured by protein consumption, diet diversity and food coping strategies. Instead, food security was strongly influenced by fishing livelihoods and household wealth: fishing families and wealthier households were more food secure than non-fishing and poorer households.

Simultaneously achieving these multiple goals is difficult due to conflicts between conservation (often long-term) and economic (often short-term) objectives. MPA implementation often includes additional control measures on fisheries (e.g. vessel size restrictions, gear exclusion, catch controls) that in the short-term may have impacts on local fishers' communities. Thus, monitoring fisheries catches before, during and after MPA implementation is essential to document changes in fisheries activities and to evaluate the impact of MPAs in fishers' communities. Remarkably, in contrast with standard fisheries-independent biological surveys, these data are rarely measured at appropriate spatial scales following MPA implementation. Here, the effects of MPA implementation on local fisheries are assessed in a temperate MPA (Arrabida Marine Park, Portugal), using fisheries monitoring methods combining spatial distribution of fishing effort, on-board observations and official landings statistics at scales appropriate to the Marine Park. Fisheries spatial distribution, fishing effort, on-board data collection and official landings registered for the same vessels over time were analysed between 2004 and 2010. The applicability and reliability of using landings statistics alone was tested (i.e. when no sampling data are available) and we conclude that landings data alone only allow the identification of general patterns. The combination of landings information (which is known to be unreliable in many coastal communities) with other methods, provides an effective tool to evaluate fisheries dynamics in response to MPA implementation. As resources for monitoring socio-ecological responses to MPAs are frequently scarce, the use of landings data calibrated with fisheries information (from vessels, gear distribution and on-board data) is a valuable tool applicable to many worldwide coastal small-scale fisheries.

When designing a short-or long-term closed area management regime, the expected impact of that closure will depend upon how that effort is redistributed. We present a redistribution model based upon Ideal Free Distributions (IFDs) which is intermediate in complexity between analyses in which effort is distributed uniformly over open areas and models of full fleet dynamics. The IFD models incorporate the fundamentals of the decision process invoked by fishers facing relocation and the ensuing catch rates that result from the addition or removal of effort. Two classes of models were tested: an Availability model where catch rate declines were proportional to abundance; and an Abundance model where abundance declines at an exponential rate with the entry of displaced effort into an area. Results of these models were compared with uniform and proportional redistribution methods. The IFD-based methods included relative cost of relocation, thereby illustrating the importance of both catch rates and movement costs in designing closed area regulations. To demonstrate the methods, hypothetical area closures to United States pelagic longliners in the western Atlantic were examined and the impact of those closures on bycatch rates was evaluated. Guidance for selecting an appropriate model structure for a particular closed area problem is given. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our examination of social resilience focused on indicators of the flexibility of household livelihood portfolios and both formal and informal governance institutions, the capacity of communities to organize, their capacity to learn, and access to household assets and community infrastructure. In general, we found high levels of flexibility in formal institutions and livelihood portfolios and high levels of participation in decision-making and community groups. Together, these indicators suggest some latent capacity to adaptively manage resources, but this capacity may be offset by poor levels of trust between communities and resource managers, a poor understanding of the ways in which humans affect marine resources, inadequate feedback of ecological monitoring to communities, inflexibility in informal governance institutions, and a lack of assets to draw upon. We suggest that building desirable resilience in Madagascar's marine protected areas will require the following: investments in community-level infrastructure, projects to generate household income, and enhanced agricultural production to improve the well-being of communities; improvements in the capacity to learn through investments in formal and informal education; enhanced trust between park staff and local communities; empowerment of communities to govern and enforce natural resources; the increased accountability of leaders and transparency of governance processes; adequate cross-scale interaction with local, provincial, and national institutions; and the pursuit of these activities in ways that capitalize on community-specific strengths, such as high flexibility and the presence of sociocultural institutions such as taboos that regulate resource use.",94,2009,,WOS:000267846300030,field,perception,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,coastal community,mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no control

Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at nine MPAs to investigate MPA managers' (n=9) and higher governmental level authorities' (n=5) perceptions on these. Varying levels of MPA governance approaches were assessed, from government-led centralized top-down (e.g. marine biological reserves) to community-based bottom-up MPA categories (e.g. marine extractive reserves). The use of fishers' LEK was found to be an essential means of achieving a broader and more diverse knowledge basis for MPA management, though most of the management current in place is still science-driven in Brazil. The full engagement of local knowledge can also be regarded as a means of empowering local communities and promoting responsibility, but only if a more inclusive praxis of participation is put to work. Different meanings for 'Local Knowledge Use' in MPA management were outlined and described for different management approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up). It was noted that each of these meanings brings different outcomes in terms of stakeholder participation and empowerment. It is also suggested that MPA co-management schemes might benefit from the adoption of a 'knowledge-building' instead of 'knowledge-using' approach during a 'problem-solving' instead of 'decision-making' management process. Finally, it is concluded that it will be an enormous challenge to put LEK to work in the benefit of MPAs in the country amidst so many priority actions brought by the problems affecting the Brazilian National System of MPAs. Government must open up the agenda to deliberatively discuss the roles of local knowledge in MPA management, whilst local communities organise themselves and increase the demand for participation with responsibility.

This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.",192,2009,10.1007/s11160-008-9092-z,WOS:000263065800005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not social mechanisms (spillover),

This study documents the development of MPA networks in the Philippines and identifies critical success factors and issues. Methods were field observation by participation in MPA and fisheries management projects and focused interviews that gathered opinions and observations of primary MPA network stakeholders in the central Visayas region. Findings show that an MPA network is defined through social and ecological criteria. From a social perspective, a network is comprised of people and organizations that manage component MPAs, benefit from the network, and promote the network's viability through shared administrative responsibility and information. To qualify as part of an ecological network, individual MPAs must interact ecologically (e.g., source or sink of larvae and propagating organisms, protection for habitat, and threatened or endangered species) to enhance fisheries and biodiversity conservation. The study found that while social and ecological criteria are shaping MPA networks through science-based planning, integrated management, and coordination, there exist numerous institutional issues related to scaling up to networks from single MPAs. Issues pertain to: limiting access to resources, boundary delineation, monitoring compliance, finding common goals and identity, and conflict resolution.

There are several problems with the way this model is conceptualized and operationalized, particularly as it pertains to aboriginal people: (1) proponents of MPAs and other marine conservation initiatives often focus on aggregate costs/benefits, without regard to distributive inequalities; (2) the prevailing assumption that all relevant stakeholders can be jointly incorporated into a collaborative process is misleading, given that there are significant differences in legal rights and other political capacities among the various stakeholders; (3) political institutions have a significant role in creating the different status of stakeholder groups, and thus shaping their interests, goals, capacities, and strategies.

The data collected was triangulated with secondary sources from published materials and with information generated during participant observation. The findings show that during the beginning of establishment of the park VLCs mobilised much greater participation and were viewed as effective conduits to MPA activities. However, the active participation of individual members within VLCs decreased with time due to unforeseen outcomes of marine conservation. Over 70% of survey respondents reported that the active role of VLCs to support the park activities has decreased significantly.

However, few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This paper examines relationships between the use of destructive seine nets and thirteen socioeconomic conditions in communities adjacent to three peri-urban marine protected areas in east Africa. Fishers using destructive gears were younger, less likely to have capital invested in the fishery, had lower fortnightly expenditures and were poorer in two multivariate indices of material style of life. Based on the two multivariate material style of life indices, a binary logistic regression model classified whether fishers used destructive gears with almost 70% accuracy. These findings are broadly consistent with the literature on poverty traps, which are situations in which the poor are unable to mobilize the resources required to overcome low-income situations and consequently engage in behaviour that may reinforce their own poverty.

Additionally, risk perceptions and concerns regarding the environmental impact and dangers of dynamite fishing among the youth are also understudied. This paper provides ethnographic insights into the historical and contextual factors underlying dynamite fishing in rural coastal Mtwara.

It relies on a broad socio-economic field survey covering 12 case studies in southern Europe, and focusing on two major uses of MPA ecosystem services: fishing and scuba-diving. The impact of these uses on the local economic system is expressed in terms of incomes and jobs, and the methodology relies on a distinction between users transforming ecosystem services into commodities, and users consuming ecosystem services for recreational purposes. Assessment results show a variety of situations, from MPAs where commercial fishing is the major economic stake, to MPAs where recreational activities have a dominant economic rote. However, available information concerning the number of recreational users and visitors, on one side, and the number and characteristics of commercial fishing boats, on the other side, suggest that the second situation is more representative of the area under study than the former one. Due to the tack of baseline, the question of sorting out the reserve effect from the site effect is addressed with the help of survey results concerning perceptions and attitudes of users. As regards divers and diving operators, answers to the survey suggest that the reserve effect plays an important role in the attractiveness of the area, Results are not so clear in the case of fishers, an ambiguity reflecting the uncertainty of the spill-over effects expected from marine reserves on fishing grounds, (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Poorer fishers in Kenya were both displaced from, and also felt like they benefited from, marine reserves.

In the German exclusive economic zone, the habitat types protected by this legislation are sandbanks and reefs; protected species include marine mammals, seabirds, and specific migratory fish species. The ICES project Environmentally Sound Fishery Management in Protected Areas (EMPAS) aims to answer two questions: (i) To what extent do specific fishing activities significantly threaten attainment of the conservation objectives of the Natura 2000 sites? (ii) What management measures would reduce these conflicts and how effective would they be at helping to ensure the favourable condition of these sites? Assessments of fishing impacts on Natura 2000 sites require basic data on the conservation status of individual habitats and species, as well as data for fine-scale distributions of ongoing fishing activities. This paper describes and discusses the process used by the EMPAS project in developing fishery-management plans for each Natura 2000 site in German offshore waters.",47,2009,10.1093/icesjms/fsn193,WOS:000262331500019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,design/recommendation,

The types and quality of habitats, both inside and outside the MPAs, may determine the likelihood of migration by fish to surrounding unprotected areas where spillover to fisheries occurs. We assessed whether MPAs enhanced catches of artisanal fisheries, using an experimental fishing study with the same fishing gear as that used by local fishers. This approach allowed us to test the hypothesis of increased catches along the borders of MPAs in comparison with those in other fishing grounds located at. medium and far distances from 3 Mediterranean MPAs: Tabarca Marine Reserve, Carry-le-Rouet Marine Reserve and Cerbere-Banyuls Marine Reserve. Surveys were clone over 2 homogeneous habitats (Posidonia oceanica meadow and sand), in 3 different seasons. Catches were significantly higher for some species near the borders of the MPAs when fishing on P. oceanica meadows, but not when fishing on sandy bottoms. The spillover effect appears to be limited by a lack of continuous Suitable habitat through the boundaries of the MPA. Some of the species that showed a significant response to protection and concurrent higher catches near the MPA borders, such as Dentex dentex, Mullus surmuletus, Phycis phycis, Sciaena Umbra and Scorpaena porcus, are target species of artisanal fisheries. Although we found that the spatial scale of the spillover-induced density gradient was localized, it was sufficient to provide local benefits to artisanal fisheries. We conclude that spillover effects are not a universal consequence of siting MPAs in temperate waters and that they are related to the distribution of habitats inside and around MPAs.",67,2009,10.3354/meps07892,WOS:000265625200015,field,CI,2003,MPA,Cerbere Banyuls,27,,1974,mix,,0.85,6.5,,yes,state,France,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean,soft bottom,,,,,,,artisanal,,fishery,food security,global,catch,neutral,yes,to be extracted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,spillover design,,

However, as success is rarely defined, what constitutes success is not clear. This paper reports an investigation into the way outsiders perceive success in Pacific island CCAs. An exploratory survey revealed six umbrella themes of success: the locus of control; local benefits; resource aspects; management; external stakeholder involvement; and sustainability. Multivariate analysis distinguished two groups, a Big picture group and a Locally focused group. These differ in how they define success, as well as their organizational alignment. The Big picture group, largely from funder agencies and international NGOs, were focused on the broad issues of success, especially the sustainability of CCAs. The Locally focused group was concerned with the practical workings and needs of successful CCAs in the Pacific; many in this group were based with Pacific island governments and NGOs or CCAs. The study concludes that success in CCAs should not be defined solely on project objectives, especially when these have been developed by an external entity or under their guidance. If they are, high rates of failure are to be expected.",14,2008,,WOS:000262291600032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other social mechanisms (preference/perception),

The perceptions of fisheries and park restrictions among resource users and managers were evaluated to try to understand the underlying causes of these conflicts. Responses concerning management preferences of government officials employed by the Mafia Island Marine Park (MIMP), personnel of the fisheries department, and heads of households in three villages in and out of the Park were compared. The largest differences in perceptions were found between villagers and managers, but all respondents agreed that minimum fish lengths and gear restrictions were beneficial and that benefits increased along the scale of the individual - community - national government. Villagers and government officials differed most in their perceptions towards area-based management, spatial and temporal closures, and species restrictions. Perceptions of management restrictions and benefits were only weakly correlated with the socioeconomic status of the villagers, but more strongly correlated with their living in or out of the Park and their family's economic options. The most negative perceptions towards restrictions were found in villages near fisheries closures, where there was a heavy reliance on marine resources and a higher numbers of jobs per household, but less reliance on cash crops, animal husbandry and tourism. The lack of these three options appears to have produced lower levels of support for MIMP and associated restrictions, and might be overcome by (1) using gear and minimum size restrictions more than fisheries closures and (2) increasing access to tourism, cash crops, animal husbandry and salaried employment, rather than simply increasing livelihood diversity.",54,2008,10.1017/S0376892908005250,WOS:000264045600008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other social mechanisms (preference/perception),

Two sites were protected from fishing for over 20 years, whereas the other five sites were heavily fished in recent years. A heavily fished site was converted into a marine park (Mombasa Marine National Park, approximately 10km(2), no fishing allowed), and the number of fishers allowed was slowly decreased between August 1991 and August 1992. The area adjacent to the park was converted into a marine reserve (only fishing traps, lines, and gill nets allowed) that provided fishing grounds for fishers excluded from the park. Data from a fish-landing site adjacent to the newly created marine park were collected for 3 years and analyzed to determine the effect of the park's creation on fish catches. Results suggest that fishing in the reserve reduced fish wet weight by about a factor of 10 and reduced fish numbers and species richness by a factor of two. Both field studies and landing site's fishing grounds were protected with the creation of the park, and 65% of the fishers quit the studied landing, leaving nearly the same density of fishers in the remaining area (similar to 12 fishers/km(2)). Further, fishers using pull seines were excluded from the reserve, and their numbers were replaced by fishers using other gear (mostly basket traps). Although the overall catch per unit effort increased by about 110% after the park's creation, the total fish landed decreased by 35% and the catch per unit effort decreased toward the end of the study period despite increasing fish abundance in the park.

Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices.

We use administrative data documenting individual fishing events to evaluate the economic impact of the expansion of these two monuments on the Hawaii longline fishing fleet.

However, lack of knowledge about the specifics of reserve geography and rules can lead to actions that adversely affect marine life (unsanctioned fishing and collecting) or disturb sensitive species within these areas, even when general support for protected areas is high. We assessed public awareness of State Marine Reserves locations and policies on the central California coast. Using surveys in the form of semi-structured interviews and written questionnaires, we asked beach visitors whether they had prior knowledge about State Marine Reserves. We provided half of participants with new knowledge about State Marine Reserves in the form of a verbal, short pre-survey speech. We asked participants to indicate if they were currently standing inside of a State Marine Reserve and assessed their self-reported likelihoods of performing several actions related to environmental etiquette such as following reserve rules. Finally, we tested how provisional new knowledge influences perceptions surrounding the importance of protecting marine habitats and human impacts on them. Overall, 60% of participants had heard of marine reserves, though this varied by participant region of residence. 33% of participants with prior knowledge and 13% of participants with no prior knowledge identified site protection status correctly. Over half of participants self-reported behaviors consistent with reserve rules and environmental etiquette. Survey participants who received new knowledge did not differ from the control group in their ability to correctly identify reserve location or in their perceptions of human impacts. Our results suggest that the information in our short verbal speech was not sufficient for changing perceptions, though over 90% of visitors stated marine protection to was already personally important or very important to them. Beach visitors intend to treat reserves well if they know they are visiting a reserve. However, because less than one third of visitors recognize reserve locations, a disconnect exists between understanding acceptable behavior for protected sites and knowing where to apply this behavior.

This study evaluates the impacts of coral reef conservation and marine protected areas (MPAs) on the well-being of fishing communities in Central Vietnam. The Cu Lao Cham MPA is chosen as the case study. Coral reef health and four aspects of human well-being (i.e., catch rate [also related to food security], access to the resource, employment, and income) are investigated following the protection in this MPA. Data on the four different aspects were gathered from different sources. The results show that there is good evidence for how coral reef conservation can transfer the flow of benefits from the ecosystem to local people. However, trade-offs also occur as a result of the development of tourism, including the degradation of fish resources and the environment.

We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50% or less of the CPUE at MSY.

Nevertheless, recreational fishers call be instrumental in successful fisheries conservation through active involvement in, or initiation of, conservation projects to reduce both direct and external stressors contributing to fishery declines. Understanding fishers' concerns for sustained access to the resource and developing methods for their meaningful participation can have positive impacts on conservation efforts. We examined a suite of case studies that demonstrate successful involvement of recreational fishers in conservation and management activities that span developed and developing countries, temperate and tropical regions, marine and freshwater systems, and open- and closed access fisheries. To illustrate potential benefits and challenges of involving recreational fishers in fisheries management and conservation, we examined the socioeconomic and ecological contexts of each case study.

With advice from managers, administrators, and scientists, a representative group of stakeholders defined biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic goals that accommodated social needs and conserved marine ecosystems, consistent with legal requirements. To satisfy biodiversity goals, we targeted 11 marine habitats across 5 depth zones, areas of high species diversity, and areas containing species of special status. We minimized adverse socioeconomic impacts by minimizing negative effects on fishers. We included fine-scale fishing data from the recreational and commercial fishing sectors across 24 fisheries. Protected areas designed with consideration of commercial and recreational fisheries reduced potential impact to the fisheries approximately 21% more than protected areas designed without consideration of fishing effort and resulted in a small increase in the total area protected (approximately 3.4%). We incorporated confidential fishing data without revealing the identity of specific fisheries or individual fishing grounds. We sited a portion of the protected areas near land parks, marine laboratories, and scientific monitoring sites to address nonconsumptive socioeconomic goals.

The results suggest that overall the fishery has benefited from all of the simulated MPAs, whereas, although the), defy categorical interpretation, effects of the MPAs on biodiversity and ecosystem structure are variable. Simultaneous application of several metrics of ecosystem status indicates that the perceived effect of an MPA on ecosystem status can depend on which metrics for ecosystem status are used, and how these metrics are interpreted. The simulations indicate that a fisheries and conservation outcome beneficial to all is possible, but not guaranteed, with the creation of an MPA. Total landings and profitability are predicted to have increased as a result of each of the MPAs, albeit at the cost of reduced landings and profits to some sectors of the fishery.

Understanding heterogeneous responses to protected areas can improve targeting of management activities and help elucidate the pathways through which impacts of protected areas occur.

This article examines the development and trajectory of King and Snow Crab fisheries in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (BR), the highly remote but globally connected Southern tip of the Americas. The feasibility of the Chilean legal instrument of Marine Management Areas (MMA) is assessed as a tool for mitigating impacts of overfishing in the area. Examining the local fishers' perspectives in complement to a context analysis we find that external management models such as the MMA are not suited to make Cape Horn fisheries sustainable. Instead, efforts should be dedicated to a continuous process of stakeholder collaboration for developing site-specific management concepts and structures. These should be embedded in the larger BR initiative. Considering the area's particular conditions, several recommendations for such a process are formulated. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants expressed a common goal of recovering depleted species and ensuring the sustainability of indigenous fishing. We found strong support for spatial protection measures, and significant overlaps amongst participants in the areas suggested for protection. The most common type of protection recommended by participants was the exclusion of commercial and recreational fisheries while allowing for indigenous fishing; this stands in contrast to the emphasis on strict no-take MPAs advocated in the literature.

The benefits to fisheries have commonly been cited as primary motives in favour of the establishment of MPAs. To date, a good deal has been theorised with regard to the benefit of MPAs to fisheries in their adjacent areas, but there has been Little empirical evidence to support or refute hypothetical claims. Considerations for fisheries' benefits are different to those of ecological benefits in several respects. Economically, fishers' Livelihoods often depend on the marine reserve being successful. It is not enough to establish that populations of fish are growing due to protection; stocks, as well as individual fish have to be sufficiently large to be catchable by the industry. Furthermore, restrictions in fishable area ought to be compensated for by increases in catches over time. In terms of the biology of the fish themselves, evidence has shown that heavily exploited commercial fish stocks can take much longer to recover from over-exploitation than previously expected. Although there have been several studies that consider the effects of export and spill-over, there have been few that focus on the patterns that these phenomena might have on the surrounding fisheries; many assume that ecological patterns will. manifest in the fishery with time. Recently, assessment methods and predictive models have been suggested for fisheries (e.g. Rapfish, Ecopath/Ecosim), some of which have been adapted specifically for MpAs. In this paper we review recent progress in the field of MPA research with particular focus on fisheries assessment. We also identify priorities, and knowledge gaps, for determining and accurately predicting the benefits of MpAs to fishers.

The potential conservation and fisheries benefits of such reserves have been debated in the public, the media, and the scientific literature. Little is known about their effectiveness for commercially valuable pelagic predators, especially for highly migratory species such as tuna and billfishes. Here we analyse the iconic Galapagos Marine Reserve, documenting interactions with and changes in associated tuna purse seine fisheries in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Using a combination of long-term onboard ob server data and a novel data set of high-resolution, remotely sensed vessel tracks (Automatic Identification System [AIS]), we reveal progressive divergence of tuna fishing effort, catch, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) trends in areas adjacent to the reserve from trends in the surrounding fished areas. Both data sets show a regionally unique hotspot of concentrated effort along the western reserve boundary now receiving >4-fold greater fishing effort density than the rest of the surrounding area. These dynamic interactions of tuna purse seine fisheries with the Galapagos Marine Reserve suggest that the reserve might enhance fish stock availability to local fisheries and help to stabilize local catches despite overall decreasing biomass trends for these highly commercial tuna stocks.",21,2017,10.3354/meps12399,WOS:000418811000001,field,BA,2015,MPA,Galapagos,17,old,1998,highly,4,45300,133000,large,yes,state,Ecuador,tropical,South America,South East Pacific,NA,,,fish,Thunnus,fished,predator,industrial,adjacent,fishery,food security,global,cpue,neutral,yes,catch set-1 year-1,Figure 3,95CI,SD,3.18,0.734693878,144,2.95,1.102040816,144,,,,,,,-0.075076026,,,0.001339823,,,,

Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices.

Carangidae and Acanthuridae accounted for 26-47% and 16-27% of the catch, respectively. Non-reef catches declined over time, from 6.21 t year(-1) in 1980/81 to 1-2 t year(-1) in 2000 and 2001. Estimates of annual hook and line catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased from 0.13-0.17 kg man(-1) h(-1) in 1980/ 81, to 1-2 kg man(-1) h(-1) in 1997-2001. For target families, hook and line CPUE was consistently higher in 1997-2001 than in 1980-86. However, hook and line CPUE for Carangidae and Acanthuridae declined significantly between 1997 and 2001.

Here Lynham et al. demonstrate that the expansion of two of the world's largest protected areas did not have a negative impact on catch rates in the Hawaii longline fishery. Two of the largest protected areas on earth are U.S. National Monuments in the Pacific Ocean. Numerous claims have been made about the impacts of these protected areas on the fishing industry, but there has been no ex post empirical evaluation of their effects. We use administrative data documenting individual fishing events to evaluate the economic impact of the expansion of these two monuments on the Hawaii longline fishing fleet. Surprisingly, catch and catch-per-unit-effort are higher since the expansions began. To disentangle the causal effect of the expansions from confounding factors, we use unaffected control fisheries to perform a difference-in-differences analysis. We find that the monument expansions had little, if any, negative impacts on the fishing industry, corroborating ecological models that have predicted minimal impacts from closing large parts of the Pacific Ocean to fishing.",10,2020,10.1038/s41467-020-14588-3,WOS:000517260700012,field,BA,2017,MPA,Papahanaumokuakea,11,old,2006,NA,,NA,1508870,large,NA,co-managed,USA,tropical,Oceania,South Pacific,mix,,,fish,thunnus obesus,fished,predator,industrial,,fishery,assets,economic,income,positive,yes,$,supp Figure 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no error value nor sample size provided,,

This influx has encouraged the implementation of monitoring and management measures by managers of protected areas that promote tourism consistent with biodiversity conservation. However, the choices that need to be made to enforce these measures are particularly complex for they need to take into account the concerns of not only a territory that produces wealth for the local population and those who live in close proximity (due to the attraction to tourists) but also those of a territory that is sensitive and vulnerable environmentally speaking. With regard to the approach initiated by the Port-Cros National Park on the carrying capacity and character of the Park?s core areas, we conducted a conflict diagnosis on Porquerolles, an island within the core area. Our aim was to bring to light the territorial realities relating to past and recent conflict situations, the reasons for disputes and the methods of managing them, thus providing focal points that would be useful to help with implementing measures relating to visitation to the island. This study, comprised of interviews, questionnaires, in-situ observations and analyses of legal documents, enabled us to go back over the conflicting history of the territory. It revealed a characterisation and spatialisation of disputes, including breaches of the Environmental Code.

Three conditions necessary for acceptability were identified for the island of Porquerolles using the conflict analysis: recognising and addressing a differential threshold of acceptance relating to visitation; strengthening trust between the different stakeholders and the proximities on the territory; envisaging a firmer penal policy to reduce the feeling of injustice associated with specific efforts in environmental protection.",0,2021,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105547,WOS:000634873700004,field,perception,2017,MPA,Port Cros,54,old,1963,highly,3.5,8,12.88,medium,yes,co-managed,France,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean,rocky reef,,,,,,,,,coastal community,social organization,,conflict,ambiguous,no,"narrative.

Nevertheless, restrictions on artisanal fishing have increased through a fishing charter (1999). In the meantime, recreational fishing was progressively banned, which has helped as a management tool to make the restrictions on artisanal fishing acceptable in social terms. Monitoring of the artisanal fishing (2000-2005) reveals the stability of the fishing fleet (9-13 vessels); of the fishing effort [number of fishing sets per day between 3.4 (+/- 2.1) and 6.9 (+/- 3.4) in spring, and 3.0 (+/- 1.7) and 5.2 (+/- 2.7) in summer]; and of yields [catch per unit effort between 1.27 (+/- 0.72) and 1.68 (+/- 1.44) kg 100 m of net(-1) d(-1)].

The implementation of multiple-use MPAs increases the challenges of communicating awareness of MPA boundaries and permitted activities. Currently, little is known about how effective signage in multiple-use MPAs is in communicating information to stakeholders that will promote supportive attitudes and behaviours towards MPAs. This study evaluated the usefulness of in-situ signage in an existing multiple-use MPA, to determine if signs pertaining to the MPA captured the attention of recreational users, and provided adequate information. Structured interviews with recreational fishers, divers, and other users, were used to determine users' awareness of being in an MPA, their awareness of management objectives and associated zoning scheme, together with levels of agreement or disagreement on whether or not current in-situ signage adequately communicates information about the MPA. It was evident that the types and accessibility of in-situ signs in the MPA may not be effective at capturing the attention of intended audiences and providing relevant information, with the exception of signs located at the dive site, due to their design, size, and placement. Awareness differed among the three user groups, together with their views on the effectiveness of signage. Many recreational fishers believed existing signage was inadequate and unclear, and expressed frustrations with the complexity of zoning rules and location of their boundaries. Based on this study, recommendations about the presentation, content, and placement of signage relative to access points, and information required by MPA users, is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study provides insights into the problems affecting the sustainability of the scuba diving tourism industry in two MPAs in Italy and Mozambique. The interactions between the industry and environment, economy, non-monetary aspects, society, governance, and scientific community were investigated via questionnaire surveys and interviews with 20 scuba diving operators.

Views were sought about the main objectives of marine protection, ideal zonation of MPAs and the ways to manage stakeholders' competing interests in MPAs. There was good agreement on the objectives of marine protection; conservation and fisheries management scored highly, while research, education and tourism had tower scores. However, there was disagreement on which objective was most important, with most stakeholders listing conservation, while fishers listed fisheries management. Most stakeholders considered MPAs that had been established for longer periods of time to offer more conservation than fisheries benefits. Analysis of the perceptions shows strong preference for having MPAs with different use zonations, including designated areas for recreational fishing, diving and the full protection of species and ecosystems. The results point to a need for increased dialogue between scientists, managers and fishers to improve the disparity in understanding the fisheries benefits of marine protection between these groups.

The selected MPAs were Cerbere-Banyuls and Carry-le-Rouet in France, and Medes, Cabrera, Tabarca, and Cabo de Palos in Spain. These MPAs had been functional for more than 8 yr and incorporate areas of fisheries closure and restricted use where fishing is limited. We based our study on the hypotheses that, in the presence of biomass export, (1) fishing effort would concentrate close to MPA boundaries, and (2) fishery production, expressed as catch per unit area (CPUA), would be highest near MPA boundaries and decrease with distance. We selected data from 14 'fishing tactics' using gill nets, trammel nets and bottom long-lines targeting sparids, mullids, serranids, scorpaenids and palinurids. We analyzed the spatial distribution of effort, fishery production and revenues per unit area, using generalized additive models (GAMs), and we tested regression slopes of effort density and CPUA with distance to closure boundaries, using generalized linear models (GLMs). GAMs allowed us to recognize habitat discontinuities or 'hot spots' of high production in the vicinity of the MPAs, and to identify the extent of potential spillover effects in order to implement GLMs. We found evidence of effort concentration and high fishery production near fisheries closures for all fishing tactics analyzed and significant negative slopes for most. Revenues generally followed trends similar to CPUA. Significant negative slopes from GLM of effort density and CPUA with distance from fisheries closures were indicative of biomass export where habitats across closure boundaries had some degree of continuity. The spatial extent of spillover was consistent with species mobility and fisheries efficiency and extended 700 to 2500 m from fishery closure boundaries.

E.",Designing marine reserves to reflect local socioeconomic conditions: lessons from long-enduring customary management systems,CORAL REEFS,,"Coral reef conservation strategies such as marine protected areas have met limited success in many developing countries. Some researchers attribute part of these shortcomings to inadequate attention to the social context of conserving marine resources. To gain insights into applying Western conservation theory more successfully in the socioeconomic context of developing countries, this study examines how long-enduring, customary reef closures appear to reflect local socioeconomic conditions in two Papua New Guinean communities. Attributes of the customary management (including size, shape, permanence, and gear restrictions) are examined in relation to prevailing socioeconomic conditions (including resource users' ability to switch gears, fishing grounds, and occupations). Customary closures in the two communities appear to reflect local socioeconomic circumstances in three ways. First, in situations where people can readily switch between occupations, full closures are acceptable with periodic harvests to benefit from the closure. In comparison, communities with high dependence on the marine resources are more conducive to employing strategies that restrict certain gear types while still allowing others. Second, where there is multiple clan and family spatial ownership of resources, the communities have one closure per clan/family; one large no-take area would have disproportionate affect on those compared to the rest of the community. In contrast, communities that have joint ownership can establish one large closure as long as there are other areas available to harvest. Third, historical and trade relationships with neighboring communities can influence regulations by creating the need for occasional harvests to provide fish for feasts. This study further demonstrates the importance of understanding the socioeconomic context of factors such as community governance and levels of dependence for the conservation of marine resources.",79,2007,10.1007/s00338-007-0213-2,WOS:000251579300035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations,

A key point of agreement is that secure long-term property rights provide an incentive for resource users to manage the resource sustainably. However, property rights mismatches create ambiguity and conflict in resource use. Though the term mismatches is usually associated with problems in matching temporal and spatial resource characteristics with institutional characteristics, I expand it here to include problems that can arise when property rights are incompletely defined or incompletely distributed. Property rights mismatches are particularly likely to occur over marine resources, for which multiple types of resource and resource user can be engaged and managed under a variety of regulatory regimes. I used New Zealand's marine resources to examine the causes and consequences of these property rights mismatches. New Zealand is particularly interesting because its property-rights-based commercial fishing regime, in the form of individual transferable quotas, has attracted considerable positive attention. However, my review of the marine natural resource management regime from a broader property rights perspective highlights a series of problems caused by property rights mismatches, including competition for resources among commercial, customary, and recreational fishers; spatial conflict among many marine resource users; and conflicting incentives and objectives for the management of resources over time. The use of a property rights perspective also highlights some potential solutions such as the layering of institutional arrangements and the improvement of how property rights are defined to encourage long-term sustainability.",36,2007,,WOS:000252310900014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not preserved areas,

In an influential article, Hastings and Botsford used an analytically tractable, spatially implicit, non-age-structured model to assert that reserves are typically incapable of increasing yields relative to conventional management, regardless of the type (pre- or post-dispersal, involving adults and/or larvae) or functional form (Ricker or Beverton-Holt) of density dependence present. A recent numerical (simulation) model by Gaylord et al. concludes that reserves can enhance yield compared to conventional management, a result the authors attribute to their spatially-explicit evaluation of stage-structured adult growth, survivability and fecundity; and intercohort (adult-on-larvae) post-dispersal density dependent population dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the increased model complexity is not responsible for the different conclusions. We analyze a spatially-implicit model without stage structure that incorporates intercohort post-dispersal density dependence. In this simple model we still find annual extirpation of adult populations outside reserves due to fishing to enhance larval recruitment there, allowing for increased yields compared to those achieved when harvest is evenly spread across the entire domain under conventional management. Consideration of neither spatially-explicit dispersal dynamics nor stage-structure in adult demographics is required for reserves to substantially improve yield beyond that attainable under conventional management. In contrast, consideration of within cohort post-dispersal density dependence among larva during settlement in an otherwise identical model generates equivalence in yield between the two management strategies. These results recast a common message characterizing the relative benefit of reserve versus non-reserve management from equivalence at best to potentially improved.",34,2007,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16167.x,WOS:000251205500011,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

The settlement of fisheries claims against the Crown by Maori, New Zealand's indigenous people, brought about the transfer of ITQ holdings to Wori, and an obligation on the Crown to recognise and provide for indigenous (customary) fishing rights over fishing grounds and other areas that have been of special significance to Maori. Some types of customary fishing areas exclude commercial fishing and could affect recreational fishing. Fisheries legislation requires that regulatory measures be put in place to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of fishing. The Government also aims to protect marine biodiversity by having 10% of New Zealand waters in some form of protection by 2010. The legislative processes for protecting the marine environment and establishing customary fishing areas include assessment of effects on fishing rights. This paper explores the conflicts that arise from legislative obligations to uphold the rights of fishers, to sustain fishstocks and to protect the marine environment. The paper concludes that inconsistent legislative obligations and their disparate processes have led to spatial conflicts and a race for the allocation of space. Legislative obligations need to be integrated to maintain a balance between use of fisheries resources and protection of the marine environment.

However, the desire to fish in the Marine Protected Area remains high among the local communities in Tsitsikamma. This has led to illegal fishing practices in the park. Consequently, the reaction of the local communities was measured using semi-structured questionnaires, informal interactions, personal observations, and through a key informant workshop that was organized in the Tsitsikamma National Park. It was found that responses from local communities to fishing within the park were defined by their residence status, ethnicity, gender, income, and educational level. There is a general understanding by local communities that the purpose of the Tsitsikamma National Park is to conserve nature within its boundaries. However, there is a mismatch in the understanding of the term 'conservation' between the local communities and conservation officials of the South African National Parks (SANParks). Local communities consider conservation to include sustainable utilization while conservation officials from the practice pursue absolute protection of the marine fisheries resources. The majority of local communities in Tsitsikamma resent this SANParks 'no-take' policy on fishing.

Scientists and managers accept that new strategies based on a long-term approach are required for future fisheries management policies. But to succeed, such strategies are likely to require more than just attempts by management to control annual levels of exploitation. Recent studies show that using MPAs (marine protected areas, marine reserves) can improve yield as well as protect stocks and sustain fishery viability. In this paper, we use a deliberately simple model, which describes an exploited fishery as a nonlinear dynamical system close to a point of bifurcation; small stochastic perturbations can therefore build up to cause fishery collapse. Extending the model shows that a MPA can buffer this stochasticity and alleviate the propensity to,collapse. The model illustrates two main points: (i) evaluating fisheries management strategies such as MPAs in a deterministic framework is inherently misleading; at worst it leads to fishery extinction, at best it fails to maximise yield; (ii) management strategies that are designed explicitly to buffer uncertainty in the system can provide a sustainable and productive fishery. Compared with harvest control rules based on uncertain estimates of stock size, our simulations indicate that MPAs can substantially reduce the risk of fisheries collapse for only a very small cost to total yield.

To fill this gap, we develop a two-patch ecological-economic model to investigate the effects of spatial management on fishery profits. Because the fishery effects of spatial management depend critically on the nature of the ecological connectivity, our model includes both juvenile and adult movement, with density dependence in settlement differentiating the two types of dispersal. Rather than imposing a reserve on our system and measuring its effect on profits, we ask: When does setting catch levels to maximize system-wide profits imply that a reserve should be created? Closing areas to fishing is an economically optimal solution when the value derived from spillover from the reserve outweighs the value of fishing in the patch. The condition, while simple to state in summary form, is complex to interpret because it depends on the settlement success of the dispersing organisms, the nature of the costs of the fishing, the economic and ecological heterogeneity of the system, the discount rate, and growth characteristics of the fish population. The condition is more likely to be satisfied when the closed area is a net exporter of biomass and has higher costs of fishing, and for fish populations with density-independent settlement (adult movement) than with density-dependent settlement (larval dispersal). Rather surprisingly, there are circumstances whereby closing low biological productivity areas, and even sometimes low cost areas to fish, can result in greater fishing profits than when both areas are open to fishing.",89,2006,10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1643:WANZAE]2.0.CO;2,WOS:000241362400003,model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,theoritical model,

The socio-economic; data were collected primarily through the use of a formal questionnaire instrument administered to the principal user groups. The questionnaire was used to collect information on demographics, capital assets and individuals' perceptions of the marine parks. The ecological evaluation involved comparative analyses of the coral reef benthic structure, urchin and fish censuses as well as a stakeholder interview survey to assess changes inside and outside the boundaries of the marine parks. The evaluation of the managerial regime of the MPAs involved a review of the legislative policies and institutional mechanisms incorporated in the management plans of the study sites. Results indicated that variation in the institutional arrangements for management and different management plans has resulted in different effects on the social and economic characteristics of user groups. For the most part, the unofficially managed Negril Marine Park achieves its management objectives yet exhibits minimal economic and social impacts on stakeholders, concurrent with minimal ecological improvements.

This ambitious target presents a number of collective action problems (CAPs) that must be addressed and overcome if fishers and other relevant actors are to collaborate towards its achievement. These are discussed, drawing on the common-pool resource (CPR) literature, with particular reference to those raised by divergent aims, predictability, different knowledges, role of advocacy, locality, level of decision-making and enforceability.

Some models of marine no-take reserves predict that reserves can enhance fishery yield. However, empirical evidence of this remains inconclusive. One reason for this may be the disregard for density-dependent body growth in most models. Density-dependent body growth links the number and size of individuals, and thus could influence the biomass of fishery yield. 2. We developed an age- and size-structured model of an exploited population and analysed the effect of implementing a no-take reserve of varying size. 3. Protecting part of a population from exploitation in a no-take reserve results in a rapid build-up of biomass inside the reserve because of increased survival. However, when body growth is density-dependent it also results in reduced length at a given age within the no-take reserve because of crowding effects. This prediction is backed up by empirical observations. 4. If there is export of individuals (here larvae) from the no-take reserve, length at a given age will also decrease in the fished part of the population outside the reserve. An increase in the number of exploitable individuals thus results in decreased individual body mass. The positive effect of larval drift on fished population size and catch numbers will therefore rarely translate into an increase in equilibrium yield biomass. 5. Synthesis and applications. When body growth is density-dependent, implementation of no-take reserves affects the body size of both protected and exploitable individuals. Although reserves can have several benefits besides increasing yields, our study shows that, if density-dependent somatic effects are important, a general increase in yield biomass cannot be expected. In populations with density-dependent body growth, reserves are more likely to decrease yield biomass unless the population is severely overexploited. Analyses of the efficiency of marine reserves as a means of enhancing the yield of fisheries need to account for ecological processes, and density-dependent body growth is likely to be key.",49,2006,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01104.x,WOS:000235220900008,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

It illuminates implicit assumptions in previous retrospective analyses of marine reserves that are unlikely to hold for large-scale fisheries. We illustrate the empirical model with an application to the Gulf of Mexico reef-fish fishery. Isolating the effects of reserves requires a full accounting of multiple gear production technologies, heterogeneity in vessel captain skill, spatial heterogeneity of fish stocks, seasonal patterns in abundance, the effects of coexisting management policies, and the possibility that the harvest sector anticipates reserve establishment.

CPUE showed a significant non-linear decline with distance from the centre of the reserve, with a depression at the boundary followed by a plateau. This depression was caused by local depletion associated with concentration of fishing effort at the reserve boundary, while the plateau suggests that lobster export from the reserve is sufficient to maintain stable catch rates Lip to 1500 in from the boundary.

It draws on the common-pool resource (CPR) literature and is premised on the thesis that building partnership capacity amongst relevant authorities and resource users provides a critical basis for overcoming collective action problems (CAPs), through the development of incentive structures and social capital, in order to achieve strategic objectives. Particular attention is paid to the influence of statutory marine biodiversity conservation obligations to the European Commission for marine special areas of conservation (MSACs), as these are an important external contextual factor. The risks of imposition and parochialism are outlined and the challenges of taking a balanced approach are discussed. The challenges posed by the attributes of the marine environment are considered, as are those posed by the policy framework for MSACs. The findings are discussed in relation to three questions: (i) which partnership models appear to have the potential to overcome the CAPs posed by inshore MSACs? (ii) what CAPs had to be addressed during the early phase of development of the MSAC co-management regimes? (iii) what are the likely future CAPs for the collaborative management of MSACs that each partnership will need to address? These preliminary findings will form the basis for future studies to analyse the outcomes of these 15 initiatives, in order to assess the strengths, in various contexts, of different approaches for building resilient and balanced, thereby effective, institutions for the co-management of MSACs in the UK.

With no marine reserves and under a constant future effort level equal to that for 1996, the size of the population was reduced and the biomass stabilised at about 40% of pre-exploitation levels. Marine reserves were ineffective at conserving biomass when limited infringement was allowed throughout an entire reserve. When infringement was absent altogether or limited to the edges of reserves, larger marine reserves lead to lower total catches and higher overall biomass. When infringement was limited to reserve edges, a single large closure was more effective at conserving biomass than more fragmented arrangements. Simulations suggested that marine reserves might lead to better conservation of a fishery-targeted species if infringement is negligible or limited to reserve margins. Even where infringement occurred only at the edges of reserves, a network of small reserves may be less effective at conserving a targeted species than a smaller number of larger reserves.",41,2005,10.1111/j.1365-2400.2005.00440.x,WOS:000228751600003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ecological outcomes (biomass),

It has been suggested that variable spacing between reserves is essential to the success of a system of marine reserves. We used numerical models to examine the effect of variable spacing on the efficacy of marine reserves for managing a fish species with sedentary adults and planktonic larvae. Variability in reserve spacing affected catch and recruitment relative to values for a uniform configuration of reserves only for populations near collapse even in the presence of a system of reserves. For species with low fishing rates or large marine reserves, variability in spacing had only a minor effect. At high fishing rates and small reserve sizes, variable reserve placement had a positive local effect on catch and recruitment when several reserves fell close to each other. These configurations led to uneven spatial distributions with greater catch and recruitment in areas with a higher concentration of reserves. Variable reserve spacing can offer additional protection to overfished populations along certain sections of the coastline, but concern for spatial homogeneity will argue for a uniform distribution of reserves covering an adequate proportion of the entire coastline.",38,2005,10.1139/f04-243,WOS:000229416200018,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

The economic indicator is defined as the sum of discounted benefits derived from exploitation of the resource in the fishery sector, assumed to be optimally managed. The biological indicator is taken as the stock density of the resource. The basic fishery model (C.W. Clark, Mathematical Bioeconomics: The Optimal Management of Renewable Resources, second ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1990) will serve as a convenient benchmark in comparing results with those that are derived from a model of two patchy populations (cf. R. Hannesson, Marine reserves: what would they accomplish, Mar. Resour. Econ. 13 (1998) 159). In the latter, a crucial characteristic is the migration coefficient with describes biological linkages between protected and unprotected areas. A set of situations where both economic and biological criteria are enhanced, after introducing a MPA, is presented. These results are obtained with the help of numerical simulations.

The hypotheses that positive perceptions towards the management of fisheries exclusion and gear-restricted areas would increase with the wealth, education, age and years of employment of the person, the history of community participation and the age of the MPA were tested. The strongest factor was employment, with fishers having significantly less positive perceptions towards areas closed to fishing than government managers, although all groups agreed area management benefited the nation. Government personnel thought that fishers and their communities benefited from area management, while most fishers did not share this view. Increasing wealth or community participation were not significant factors, but secondary education was associated with more positive perceptions of area management. Fishers adjacent to the oldest MPA held significantly more positive perceptions than fishers living adjacent to the newest MPA, although only a slight majority agreed that they and their communities benefited. The results point to a need for patience in expecting change in resource users' perceptions, adopting an approach in which there is more communication between fishers and managers, so that both are more aware of MPA functions, particularly closed areas and the indirect benefits.",125,2005,10.1017/S0376892904001791,WOS:000231043700005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other social mechanism (support/perception),

They are designed to maintain stocks of commercially important species above target levels. However, their limitations are evident from continuing declines in fish stocks throughout the world. We make the case that to reverse fishery declines, safeguard marine life and sustain ecosystem processes, extensive marine reserves that are off limits to fishing must become part of the management strategy. Marine reserves should be incorporated into modem fishery management because they can achieve many things that conventional tools cannot. Only complete and permanent protection from fishing can protect the most sensitive habitats and vulnerable species. Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management failure, including risk-prone quota setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it.",238,2005,10.1098/rstb.2004.1578,WOS:000227514700010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations,

We simulated a hypothetical fishery loosely based on the Icelandic cod fishery, using a simple spatially explicit dynamic model. We compared the performance with respect to conserving the resource and economic return for each type of control measure alone and in combination. In general, combining more than one type of primary direct control on fishing provides a greater buffer to uncertainty than any single form of fishery control alone. Combining catch quota control with a large closed area is a most effective system for reducing the risk of stock collapse and maintaining both short and long-term economic performance. Effort controls can also be improved by adding closed areas to the management scheme. We recommend that multiple control methods be used wherever possible and that closed areas should be used to buffer uncertainty.

An analysis of stylized fisheries,BENTHIC HABITATS AND THE EFFECTS OF FISHING,Symposium on Effects of Fishing Activities on Benthic Habitats,"In this paper, we analyze the bioeconomic consequences of using marine protected areas (MPAs) to manage fisheries. Marine protected area proponents assert that the potential benefits of MPAs include larger population biomass and associated fishery harvests. Most analytical models have considered only direct changes in harvest patterns resulting from decreases in fishing mortality following establishment of an MPA. Yet recent studies show that mobile fishing gear can decrease fish habitat complexity and alter benthic species composition. Protection of the services provided by the environment in which fish live, grow, and reproduce may be the most important fishery benefit associated with MPAs. Our main objective is to examine the conditions under which MPAs are likely to increase net benefits. Our analysis is based on a stylized bioeconomic model in which fishing has an impact on fish habitat. We examine two distinct sub-categories: (1) fishing effort that impacts the habitat of its target species, and (2) fishing effort that impacts the habitat of species targeted by other fisheries. The model incorporates the movements of the fish population between open and closed areas and the response of the fishing effort level in the area remaining open. Equilibrium stock, catch, and profit levels are compared for open access and the level of effort at which net revenue is maximized. Habitat effects are then incorporated and compared to cases where only stock effects occur. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine a wide range of fishing costs, MPA sizes, damage functions, and migration rates. Our model shows that consideration of habitat may be the main reason to use MPAs as a fishery management tool. The curvature of the habitat damage function is also shown to be an important factor when considering the potential use of MPAs.",6,2005,,WOS:000232152900054,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,assets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns.

However, small-scale community-based reserves are often inefficient owing to management inadequacies arising because of a lack of local support or enforcement or poor design. Because there are many potential pitfalls during the establishment of even small community-based reserves, it is important for coastal managers, communities, and facilitating institutions to have access to a summary of the key factors for success. Reviewing relevant literature, we present a framework of lessons learned during the establishment of protected areas, mainly in the Philippines. The framework contains summary guidance on the importance of ( 1) an island location, ( 2) small community population size, ( 3) minimal effect of land-based development, ( 4) application of a bottom-up approach, ( 5) an external facilitating institution, ( 6) acquisition of title, ( 7) use of a scientific information database, ( 8) stakeholder involvement, ( 9) the establishment of legislation, ( 10) community empowerment, ( 11) alternative livelihood schemes, ( 12) surveillance, ( 13) tangible management results, ( 14) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and ( 15) small-scale project expansion. These framework components guided the establishment of a community-based protected area at Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental, Philippines. This case study showed that the framework was a useful guide that led to establishing and implementing a community- based marine reserve. Evaluation of the reserve using standard criteria developed for the Philippines shows that the Danjugan Island protected area can be considered successful and sustainable. At Danjugan Island, all of the lessons synthesized in the framework were important and should be considered elsewhere, even for relatively small projects. As shown in previous projects in the Philippines, local involvement and stewardship of the protected area appeared particularly important for its successful implementation. The involvement of external organizations also seemed to have a key role in the success of the Danjugan Island project by guiding local decision-makers in the sociobiological principles of establishing protected areas. However, the relative importance of each component of the framework will vary between coastal management initiatives both within the Philippines and across the wider Asian region.",36,2004,10.1007/s00267-004-0149-z,WOS:000227236800003,field,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,agency,,involvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recommendations

We find that under the conditions of variability tested, reserves can increase the probability of achieving target levels of biomass (60%, 35%, and 5% of carrying capacity) and can reduce catch variability in neighbouring fisheries, making future planning in the fishery more efficient. The size of the reserve required to meet each objective will depend on the initial condition of the stock and the exploitation rate in the fishery. Reserve coverage of between 20% and 40% prevent stock collapse in most cases. In heavily exploited fisheries, reserves are also likely to enhance mean catches, particularly in highly variable systems. If the stock has previously been heavily exploited, large reserves (greater than or equal to60%) may be required to significantly increase the probability of achieving target biomass levels. However, once stocks have recovered, reserve coverage may be reduced without a reduction in this probability of success.",22,2004,10.1139/f04-142,WOS:000227073300003,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,catches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

MPAs that restrict fishing and other human activities conserve habitats and populations and, by exporting biomass, may sustain or increase yields of nearby fisheries. Here we provide an estimate of the costs of a global MPA network, based on a survey of the running costs of 83 MPAs worldwide. Annual running costs per unit area spanned six orders of magnitude, and were higher in MPAs that were smaller, closer to coasts, and in high-cost, developed countries. Models extrapolating these findings suggest that a global MPA network meeting the World Parks Congress target of conserving 20-30% of the world's seas might cost between $5 billion and $19 billion annually to run and would probably create around one million jobs. Although substantial, gross network costs are less than current government expenditures on harmful subsidies to industrial fisheries.

For most species catch per unit effort (CPUE) in traditional Dema traps fished across park boundaries was higher within the parks (up to an order of magnitude). However, a few species (e.g., the seagrass parrotfish, Leptoscarus uaigensis and the whitespotted rabbitfish, Siganus sutor, WSR) had higher seasonal CPUE outside the parks. Potential spillover of fishes from the parks to adjacent fished areas was tested with a logistic decay model of density gradients (CPUE) across park borders from fringing and patch reefs. A steep decay in CPUE off the Malindi patch reef suggested little spillover of most species. However, greater spillover was suggested off fringing reefs. Species differences were evident. The two most important commercial species showed different density gradients. Species diversity declined more abruptly off the fringing reefs.

The evaluation was a participatory process that involved several institutions: academe, an externally-funded project, local governments, national government agencies and research organizations. Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys. We illustrate that a multidisciplinary approach and engagement of key stakeholders provides a comprehensive assessment and consensus for measuring the success of MPAs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Support for MPAs decreased with increasing level of restrictiveness. Anglers attitudes towards the establishment of catch-and-release MPAs were somewhat divided. The majority of those surveyed were opposed to no-take reserves. If no-take reserves are to be accepted by anglers, managers need to convince them of the advantages of incorporating this innovative management tool over more traditional fishery regulations alone. Anglers were more opposed to MPAs that restrict recreational fishing within state waters as compared to similar MPAs sited in federal waters. In general, anglers from New York and New Jersey held more favorable MPA attitudes than did anglers from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Anglers who were members of a fishing organization were more opposed to MPAs than were non-members. Anglers whose most preferred species was striped bass were more opposed to no-take reserves than were anglers whose most preferred species was summer flounder.

While conflict resolution Was a plan priority, other factors, such as cumulative environmental impacts of users and protection for the critically endangered grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus), further complicated planning. Both scuba diving and angling are primary summer activities and are disproportionately concentrated around the headlands of the bay. Furthermore, shore based game-fishing was concentrated on the northern headland, where the conflict was centered. However, when the exact locations of divers and anglers were determined, there was a partial partitioning of the available space, with only a small contested overlap. To resolve conflict and maximize positive environmental outcomes, a sanctuary zone and no-anchoring zone option in the draft zoning plan was sought to formalize this partition.

The organized recreational fishing community-composed of angler groups, for-hire fishing providers, and the tackle industry-views MPAs with great scepticism at best and outright opposition and hostility at the extreme. That is because this stakeholder community equates the term MPA with no-fishing zone. Executive Order 13158 defines the term marine protected area only in broad terms as any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by [law] or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural or cultural resources therein. Yet public discourse in marine resource management, public policy, and nonfishing stakeholder circles defines, or at least implies, the very discrete (and to anglers, very inflexible and threatening) definition of no-fishing or no-take zone. A review of the official positions on MPAs as voiced by organizations within the organized recreational fishing community is presented. Much of the information is derived from a meeting of U.S. recreational fishing leaders convened in February 2003 to examine a variety of issues related to marine fish management, particularly at the federal level, and angler participation in the process. Marine protected areas were identified as a major topic for discussion among representatives to the Sportfishing Leadership Conference, which had federal fishery managers in attendance.

However, global policy has preceded the development of generic models and experience to underpin the design of effective MPAs for sustainable fisheries. Four main classes of potential benefits can be identified for MPAs in fisheries-biological support for the exploited stock, socioeconomic benefits for the fishers, biodiversity benefits for the fished ecosystems, and increased fishery stability. The extent to which any MPA will achieve these benefits depends on its design, its integration with the broader fishery management system, and the effectiveness of the existing stock management. An MPA may deliver only limited additional support for a stock that is already well managed, but an appropriately designed MPA may be able to offer other benefits to the fishery such as an ecological offset for the effects of fishing on habitats. Delivering these benefits depends on establishing a priori design principles and decision rules in relation to each specified objective that an MPA is established to achieve. Measuring the benefits requires a performance assessment and reporting system, including specific performance indicators, that is directly linked to the objectives of the MPA. The biggest single threat to the success of fisheries MPAs is model failure-the situation where MPAs are established that do not reflect the implicit and explicit sustainability objectives of the fishery. Fisheries MPAs established without comprehensive design and performance assessment systems are likely to be neither successful nor secure and are unlikely to meet medium-term or long-term sustainability objectives.",5,2004,,WOS:000223814600006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,theory/recommendations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,conference but no full text

The spatial configuration is typically set by choosing the habitat, species, and ecosystems to protect, assuming that the associated species will be sustained in that configuration. The concerns of fishermen are typically addressed by describing various spillover mechanisms and suggesting that yields will increase. There is a growing scientific understanding of the effects of reserves on the sustainability of populations and fishery yield, and the practical implications of those results should be incorporated into policy decisions. While there are exceptions, analytical and simulation results from models with sedentary adults indicate that yield will increase only if a population has been fished hard enough to cause a substantial decline in recruitment. This is consistent with the rough equivalence between yields possible with marine reserves and conventional management. This equivalence is a useful benchmark in the absence of information on larval advection and spatial variability in productivity. With reserves, lower fishery yields will be obtained from species dispersing shorter distances. Both yield and preservation goals depend on species in reserves being sustainable. Sustainability of species in reserves will depend on their dispersal distances and the spatial configuration of reserves. Species will be sustained in marine reserves if the alongshore dimension of the reserve is greater than its mean dispersal distance (assuming little alongshore displacement of the dispersal pattern), but species dispersing all distances will be sustained in networks of reserves, if a specific fraction of the coast is covered. Yield will be greater as the size of individual reserves in that network becomes smaller. Shorter-distance dispersers are always more likely to persist. Sustainability and yield in marine reserves depend on three categories of uncertainty: (1) uncertainty in population response to management is less when employing marine reserves than in conventional management, (2) uncertainty in the slope of the stock-recruitment relationship at low abundance affects both reserves and conventional fishery management, and (3) uncertainty in the pattern of larval dispersal affects management by reserves much more than conventional fishery management. Most of the available results are modeling results, and there is a need for better empirical information on both sustainability and yield. We need to know more than just whether marine reserves sustain populations and increase yield; rather, we need to know which kinds of reserves (i.e., size and spacing) sustained populations and which kinds of species (i.e., dispersal distance) were sustained and showed increased yields.",14,2004,,WOS:000223814600009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,theory/recommendations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,conference but no full text

Their historic and present management structures are reviewed.

Nondestructive sampling methods are preferred, but potential insights into fishery management benefits may be limited. The toolbox of fisheries science contains established length-based methods that can potentially be used to extend assessment analyses. In northeastern Australia, state regulations allow commercial gill nets to be set within most regional estuaries, primarily targeting barramundi Lates calcarifer (Centropomidae; also known as barramundi perch). The state closed several riverine estuaries throughout this region to commercial fishing in the early 1980s. To monitor the effect of these closures on barramundi (and other) populations, our research teams deployed gill nets (mesh sizes 19-152 mm) bimonthly over 2 years within three pairs of systems (one closed and one neighboring estuary open to commercial net fishing per pair). On an hourly basis during each net set (1500-2100 hours), all fish were removed and measured. Of 1,657 barramundi netted, 96% were returned to the water alive. Catch averaged 2.8 times greater, and biomass 3.5 times greater, in closed systems compared to open (P<0.02). Barramundi catch in closed systems exceeded that in open systems for each 30-mm length-class, including all classes below the legal limit of 580 mm. Barramundi are well-studied, protandrous hermaphrodites occurring in spatially discrete stocks in tropical mangrove estuaries. Applying published parameter values in a length-based analysis revealed that estimated egg-production was 21 times greater in the closed systems (P<0.03). In fact, egg,production in commercially fished estuaries was estimated to be near zero. The single most important factor in sustaining the commercial barramundi fishery in this region may be the function of interspersed estuarine reserves in providing sources of spillover and recruitment to neighboring open systems. Given current regulations, a network of protected estuaries may be especially beneficial, if not essential, for maintaining a sustainable fishery along this coast.",6,2004,,WOS:000223814600020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,experimental fishing in a no-take reserve,

The paper assesses the extent to which these elements are receiving explicit consideration in current practice and the degree to which they are contributing to controversy in MPA implementation.",3,2004,,WOS:000223814600026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,management costs of MPAs,

However, not all reserves perform equally, and predicting the response of marine communities to management actions in the long run is challenging. Our decadal-scale survey of recreational fishing yields at France's 45-year old Cerbere-Banyuls marine reserve indicated significant protection benefits, with 40-50% higher fishing yields per unit effort in the partial-protection zone of the reserve (where fishing is permitted but at a lower level) than in surrounding non-reserve areas. Over the period 2005-2014, catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined both inside and outside the reserve, while weight per unit effort (WPUE) increased by 131% inside and decreased by 60% outside. Different CPUE and WPUE trajectories among fish families indicated changing catch assemblages, with yields increasing for the family most valued by fisheries, Sparidae (the ecological winners). However, reserve benefits were restricted to off-shore fishermen (the social winners), as on-shore yields were similar to 4 times lower and declining, even inside the reserve. Our study illustrates how surveys of recreational fishing yields can help evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas for key social and ecological protagonists. We show that, more than four decades after its establishment, fishing efficiencies at the historical Cerbere-Banyuls marine reserve are still changing, but benefits in terms of catch abundance, weight, and composition remain predominantly restricted to off-shore fishermen.

What most managers neglect to include in management is social science to inform the development of more effective marine protected areas (MPAs). This is a significant problem in the Mediterranean where few socio-cultural and economic studies have been conducted. This paper begins to fill this knowledge gap by accounting for a comparative study of three marine reserves in Sicily, Italy. Using data collected with standard anthropological field methods, analysis was conducted on how artisanal fishers are impacted by reserves, the extent of their knowledge regarding regulations, their opinions on management, and demographics. The results indicate that while fishers are aware of the marine reserves where they fish, most fishers were not well informed of the regulations. Fishers feel alienated from the management process, and would feel more comfortable with reserve managers and regulations if they were involved in management. The paper concludes by showing how such data could help to develop more useful and practical management practices.",0,2004,,WOS:000224516900055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,duplicate,

Where extraction of living resources is forbidden, these MPAs are best referred to as marine reserves. Often these are proposed as a safeguard against collapse of fish stocks, although reserves may have numerous other beneficial purposes. However, as a tool for fisheries management, where optimal and/or maximum sustainable yield is the objective, I submit that reserves are generally not as effective as traditional management measures, and are not appropriate for the vast majority of marine species. This is because most marine species are far too mobile to remain within a reserve and/or are not overfished. However, in the United States, of those marine fishes that are experiencing overfishing or are overfished, most have come under management within the last decade, employing more traditional fishery management measures, and are experiencing recovery. For those few species which could receive benefit, creation of reserves would have an adverse effect on harvest potentials of sympatric forms.",41,2003,10.1577/1548-8446(2003)28[10:APOMRA]2.0.CO;2,WOS:000187121200006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,theory/opinion,

They are principally studied from a biological perspective, with some cases documenting improved environmental conditions and increased fish yields. The MPAs that meet narrowly defined biological goals are generally presented as successes. However, these same MPAs may, in fact, be social failures when social evaluation criteria are applied. A review of four MPAs in the Philippines and Indonesia demonstrates this scenario. The cases are reviewed using standard measures of biological and social success. Their historic and present management structures are reviewed. It is suggested that a strong linkage exists between social and biological success, with social considerations determining long-term biological success. This finding implies that standards for measuring both biological and social success should be applied equally and that MPAs should be designed to meet multiple social and biological goals.

Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives. We demonstrate that optimistic conclusions about reserves may be an artifact of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Some recent works advocate for the use of marine reserves as a central element of future stock management. In the present paper, we study the influence of protected areas upon fisheries sustainability through a simple dynamic model integrating non-stochastic harvesting uncertainty and a constraint of safe minimum biomass level. Using the mathematical concept of invariance kernel in a robust and worst-case context, we examine through a formal modeling analysis how marine reserves might guarantee viable fisheries.

This paper provides estimates of the total economic impacts of FGBNMS sport divers on the Texas coastal community where they boarded their dive charter boats (Freeport, Texas). FGBNMS managers wanted a baseline understanding of the extent of new money entering the local and state economy as a result of the marine sanctuary. We sent an l l page mail questionnaire to a sample of 1,059 sport divers using dive charter boats along the Texas coast; 528 were returned for a response rate of 56%. FGBNMS divers spent an average of $259 in the local-community and $94 elsewhere in Texas on their last diving trip. Most (74%) of local expenditures were made for charter dive boat fees. We estimated the expenditures of non-local Texas residents in the Freeport area at between $363,079 and $407,344. Non-residents of Texas spent an additional $204,068 to $407,346 in the local community. Using a multiplier of 1.8169 (number of times money is spent and re-spent before leaving the local economy), diver direct expenditures resulted in $1,030,450 to $1,155,800 of total economic output in the local area. This level of economic output also generated 21 to 24 jobs. The total value-added (or income and taxes that remain in the local community) was estimated at between $653,921 and $733,467. Various uses of economic impact data will be discussed.",0,2003,,WOS:000182548000029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not impact of MPA,

The effects of fishing pressure and habitat on biomass and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of three species of exploited reef fish were studied at South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands. Distribution and abundance of hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus) and white margate (Haemulon album) were inversely correlated with cover of fleshy macroalgae. Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) were positively associated with vertical relief, but were unaffected by algal cover. Mean size, density, and biomass of hogfish were higher in a small (4 km(2)) marine reserve than on fished reefs, as was biomass of white margate. CPUE of hogfish was inversely related to distance from the centre of the reserve, suggesting that spillover of this species from the reserve to adjacent reefs may enhance local yields, possibly providing economic incentives for fishers to comply with reserve regulations. Fishing pressure, however, had no apparent effect on Nassau grouper. Larger fishes and those that migrate to spawn, such as economically valuable Nassau grouper, may move over too large a range to be effectively protected by small marine reserves. Small reserves may not protect all fish, but they can increase the biomass of smaller or more sedentary reef fishes and may be a useful tool for the conservation or management of species such as hogfish. Other policy options, such as seasonal spawning closures or total allowable catches, need to be considered for larger, more mobile fishes in the Turks and Caicos Islands.",23,2002,10.1017/S0376892902000346,WOS:000182033200006,field,CI,2001,MPA,"Admiral Cockburn Land, East Harbor Losbster",9,,1992,mix,,4,16,,yes,NA,Turks and Caicos,tropical,Central America,Caribbean Sea,coral reef,,,fish,mix,fished,,artisanal,,fishery,food security,global,cpue,positive,yes,kg hour-1 person-1,table 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,compares fishing in no-take zone (from illegal poaching) to cpue of fished areas,,

Community-based marine protected areas in the Philippines,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,,"In 1985, in response to declining coral reef conditions, local residents and officials established small, no-take marine sanctuaries on Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands through a community-based process. The implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) on Baticasag and Pamilacan Islands has been a partial success. As a direct result of protection, living hard coral cover has increased by 119% in Balicasag's sanctuary and by 67% in the non-sanctuary during the period 1984 to 1999, but Balicasag's reef is increasingly affected by breakage from anchors from dive boats and Crown-of-thorns starfish infestations. During the same period, living hard coral cover decreased by 20% in Pamilacan's sanctuary and by 45% in the non-sanctuary from 1984 to 1999. The decrease in living hard coral cover in Pamilacan's sanctuary is most likely a result of the 1998 bleaching event, Crown-of-thorn starfish and possible storm damage. Although there was an initial increase in the economically important target fish abundance in the Balicasag sanctuary and non-sanctuary and in the Pamilacan sanctuary during the first two years of implementation in the mid-1980s, there has since been a significant decline. Mean target fish abundance for the Balicasag non-sanctuary at 230 (+/-65) individuals per 500 m(2) is not significantly different from control sites without MPAs on nearby Panglao and Cabilao Islands at 164 (+/-67) individuals per 500 m(2). In general, fish abundance and diversity inside and outside the sanctuaries peaked in 1986, a year after the establishment of the sanctuaries when enforcement was strictest. Therefore, despite considerable success in enforcing regulations associated with these small MPAs at Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands, a trend of declining fish abundance and species richness among economically valuable species immediately outside the no-take areas highlights the limitations of small and isolated MPAs. This study contributes to the growing sentiment that it is not realistic for scattered, small no-take areas to maintain fish abundance and diversity on surrounding reefs when intensive fishing effort immediately adjacent to no-take areas removes most fish that exit these areas. This finding emphasizes the importance of nesting individual MPAs within broader management regimes that lead to overall fishing effort reduction and networking of MPAs. Among other recommendations, the authors advocate for continued support for community-based MPAs, a network of MPAs, reduced fishing effort in areas surrounding the MPAs and other management measures to improve the quality of the coral reef habitats.

Increases in mean size and/or abundance of protected species within MPAs may also provide nonextractive economic value to recreationalists. In this research, we assessed scuba diver preferences for viewing Nassau grouper and the marginal trade-offs that divers exhibited between fish size and abundance and between dive group size and price in the Turks and Caicos Islands. We used results from a paired comparison conjoint survey to develop market share simulations of dive site choice. Market shares increased significantly for sites with increased Nassau grouper abundance and mean size. This implies that Nassau groupers provide nonextractive economic value to divers.

In the Mediterranean,few data are available on the socio-economic consequences of MPAs. The present study reviews the existing data on MPAs in Spain, France, Italy and Greece. A general increase in tourist activities in Mediterranean MPAs is evident, as are increases in the abundances of larger fish species, although there are no data indicating yields for fisheries increase adjacent to MPAs. A large increase in the number of divers and vessels using MPAs has already had impacts on natural benthic communities as a result of diver damage, mooring and the feeding of large fish by divers. Emphasis has been given in only a few MPAs to promoting public awareness of these impacts. Although the conservation of nature should be considered the fundamental objective of MPAs, neglecting their social, cultural and economic impacts has at times led to poor local consensus, if not hostility, We believe that planning and managing MPAs should be conducted on a multidisciplinary basis. Nonetheless, no single model can be considered valid for the whole Mediterranean. The very variable characteristics of coastal areas, from those of small uninhabited islands to those of cities, require different weightings to be assigned for each factor in order to achieve a durable equilibrium and realize the original objectives of each MPA.

Results indicate that, despite increasing fishing power in the Hong Kong fleet, a 10-20% MPA/AR system could provide significant benefits within 10 yrs, and shifts to low-value pelagic fish could be reversed. Approximate scores, expressing how species benefit from protected ARs, suggest that results are not biased by changes in species composition. The design of MPA/ARs balances island biogeographic theory with the needs of monitoring and compliance: minimizing perimeter losses and establishing colonizing corridors are trade-offs with statistical replication and monitoring, whereas sacrifice of some ARs to fishing encourages compliance and learning. In Hong Kong, workshops with fishing communities encouraged support. Bioeconomic analysis shows an MPA/AR system increasing fishery value, but noncompliance rapidly erodes benefits.

In preparation for the establishment of a marine protected area around the Farasan Islands and its management, surveys were undertaken to assess the slate of the coastal and marine resources, and the issues associated with human activities. Stakeholders were interviewed about issues and their attitudes towards the proposed protected area, and constraints to planning and management were identified. Marine habitats included seagrass beds, mangroves, and extensive areas of fringing reef dominated by a diverse coral community or a mixture of coral and macroalgae. Although used for a diverse range of human activities (fishing, shipping, transport, military purposes, recreation, waste dumping, sand extraction) impacts were minimal and localized. The most immediate threat to the marine resources was over-exploitation by fisheries. The types of management activities appropriate to the MPA, and the scale of management, were constrained by a number of unique and important factors: declines in national financial support for conservation efforts, a lack of trained personnel, difficulties in attracting staff to this remote location, loss of community support, the absence of a tourist base from which economic instruments could be developed, and the lack of local nongovernmental organizations. Management recommended for the Farasan Islands Marine-Protected Area included zoning, community participation in management, public awareness, and training as a first step, followed by site-specific management actions, research and monitoring, and infrastructure development.

Such collaboration is one element of cooperative (or co-) management of local fisheries, which is gaining recognition as potentially more effective, appropriate, and equitable than traditional, top-down resource management.

They also included the key assumptions that adults did not cross reserve boundaries and that larvae mixed thoroughly across the boundary but were retained sufficiently to produce a stock-recruitment relationship for the management area. We analyzed the results of these models to determine how reserve size, fishing mortality, and life history traits, particularly population growth potential, affected the fisheries benefits from reserves. We predict that reserves will enhance catches from any overfished population that meets our assumptions, particularly heavily overfished populations with low population growth potential. We further predict that reserves can enhance catches when they make up 40% or more of fisheries management areas, significantly higher proportions than are ty reserve systems. Finally, we predict that reserves in systems that meet our assumptions will reduce annual catch variation in surrounding fishing grounds. The fisheries benefits and optimal design of marine reserves in any situation depended on the life history of the species of interest as well as its rate of fishing mortality. However, the generality of our results across a range of species suggest that marine reserves are a viable fisheries management alternative.",172,1999,,WOS:000081432700016,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

This paper draws from the results of fourteen-months of fieldwork conducted on the Caribbean islands of Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, focused on identifying fishermen's livelihood approaches and determining the variables that influence their decision to accept or reject conservation programs. Findings suggest that fishermen deliberately diversify their livelihoods, ensuring resiliency when faced with fluctuations in marine resources and, more recently, resource management policies.

We investigate a metapopulation model to see how marine reserves might help to conserve such populations and benefit fisheries. The model defines two kinds of patches: (i) those open to fishing and (ii) those maintained as reserves free from exploitation. Each patch may occur in one of two states according to whether or not it contains fishes recruited to the fishery. It is shown that reserves become highly beneficial as the local extinction rate caused by fishing becomes large because they provide a source of recruitment into fished-out patches. In such circumstances, the introduction of reserves meets the needs both of conservation and of sustainable exploitation of the fishery. The abundance of the exploitable population is maximized when half of all patches (reserves + exploited patches) are occupied by the stock. The sustainable yield is also maximized when half of all patches are occupied, assuming that yield is proportional to the local extinction rate. This result could provide a rule of thumb for fishery managers addressing the specific question of enhancing recruitment in heavily deleted stocks of certain reef fisheries. However, like other metapopulation models, the one here makes some important simplifying assumptions which would need to be addressed in the application of these results to specific fisheries.",123,1995,10.1016/0006-3207(94)00047-T,WOS:A1995QC71200010,model,,,MPA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fishery,food security,,cpue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,model

The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option.

As MPAs have proliferated, the conservation community has begun to supplement traditional biological metrics with social and community considerations in the way it seeks to manage and evaluate such tools. To assess management outcomes and opportunities for a network of community -based, marine no-take zones (NTZs) in the Mexican Caribbean, semi-structured interviews were carried out with fishers and key management stakeholders. Findings indicate that the community-based management strategy has inherent tradeoffs between community engagement and conservation potential.

One county promoted a net subsidy program of preferred mesh sizes with a distinct purchase and distribution date, while the other supported the ongoing maintenance of fisheries closures. This provoked a BACI design where standard fisheries statistics were measured 3 years prior to and 2.5 years after the net subsidy, or the life expectancy of these nets. Only similar to 50% of the purchased nets were utilized, indicating a replacement rather than addition of capital and low need. For example, net fishing effort did not change and there was an overall demographic change in gear use away from traps toward lower cost spearguns. Net subsidized fisheries displayed a 9% increase in the mean length of captured fish but also a decline in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) and personal incomes and no change in prices, yields, and per area incomes. In contrast, the fisheries surrounding closures displayed increased fishing effort and a 4% decline in fish lengths but increased CPUE, yield, incomes, and per area revenues. The net cost of maintaining closures was less than the gear subsidy purchase. Significant time x treatment interactions in all indicators support the conclusion that gear subsidies, apart from larger fish sizes, worsened the fisheries, while closures improved it.

Although 90% of the total marine protected area in the Philippines is considered partially protected, no studies have focused on the effectiveness of latter areas in this region. Potential benefits of a partially protected marine area for fishes was investigated by comparing the species richness and abundance of commercially important fishes in this area with those in a fully protected area and adjacent unrestricted fishing ground in San Miguel Island, eastern Philippines. Fishing is forbidden in the fully protected area. Fishing activities in the partially protected marine area and open fishing area were also investigated through interviews with local fisherman. Species richness and abundance in the completely protected zone were significantly higher than those in the partially protected and open fishing areas; however, no difference was found between the partially protected and open fishing areas. Similarly, fishing pressure indices (e.g., fishing time, catch, and gear type) between the partially protected and open fishing areas were not different. Overall, full protection of a marine area confers greater benefits than partial protection; however, under high fishing pressure, partially protected areas are rendered less effective than an open fishing zone. Although this study was conducted at a single location, the results raise awareness of the issue of partially protected area management and highlight importance of establishing well designed partially protected areas in this country.

Project objectives were to investigate coastal and marine social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks and to analyse socio-political and institutional structures and processes in order to support adaptive coastal governance. Participating researchers worked in the Spermonde Archipelago, off South Sulawesi, Indonesia, between 2007 and 2010. Methods included ship-based research excursions, several classical surveys, anthropological participant observation, and participatory research methods applied by an interdisciplinary social-natural science team. This paper summarises our findings and draws policy conclusions. First, we discuss Marine Protected Areas and participation focussing on local rules-in-use. In addition, reef exploitation and local livelihoods, in particular fisheries and mariculture, and the existing social networks and hierarchies in fisheries are explored to understand social vulnerability, resilience and marine resource governance in the context of the Spermonde Archipelago.

However, the catch around the marine reserve consisted of fewer but larger lobsters than at Little Barrier Island, while the size and number of lobsters caught per trap haul at Coastal Leigh was intermediate between the other two locations.

The CPUE was higher in the fishing community that was further away from the MPA, fish biomass was higher in the islands located inside the MPA in the southern region and in the islands located outside the MPA in the northern region, while fishers were making the most money closest to the MPA, where conflicts are the highest, probably from practicing very intensive fisheries.

Despite these efforts, many marine animals are still threatened, partly due to lack of compliance with conservation regulations. Meanwhile, research suggests that conservation efforts which also take socio-economic factors such as fishermen's livelihoods into account during planning and implementation are more likely to succeed. This study examined the compliance and socio-economic situation of local fishing communities at three sites in Indonesia (Nusa Penida, Tanjung Luar and Komodo National Park) where shark and manta ray conservation efforts have been implemented. 59 local residents were interviewed. The results showed that 49% of those residents had experienced a deterioration and 37% an improvement in their economic situation since conservation efforts in the form of species protection or MPAs were implemented in their area. The economic situation of the residents was associated with their access to alternative livelihoods, access to information on conservation rules, and relationship with conservation authorities. Particularly, interviewees with easier access to alternative income and a positive relationship with conservation authorities also experienced an increase in their economy.

A.",Lobster fishery and marine reserve interactions in central New Zealand,MARINE POLICY,,"Full no-take marine reserves (MRs) act as tools for biodiversity protection that reduce or remove human-induced disturbances and support the recovery of harvested species. Even if not designed specifically for fisheries management, MRs have the potential to enhance locally and distantly fished populations. This study quantified contemporary catch per unit effort (CPUE) of rock lobsters (RLs) with respect to weight and abundance inside and outside two central New Zealand MRs (Kapiti MR established in 1992, Taputeranga MR established in 2008) using commercial fishing methods (pots), and compared it to historical CPUE data. On average, mean CPUE and mean RL size were significantly greater inside than outside at both MRs. Contemporary CPUE at both MRs was approximately twice that of historical CPUE prior to the reserves being established. At Taputeranga, but not at Kapiti MR, we observed a gradient in CPUE with distance from the centre of the reserve. MRs had higher CPUE at reefs that were fully protected (entire reef in the MR) than at partially protected reefs (reef spans the MR boundary), which in turn had higher CPUE than unprotected reefs (entire reef outside the MR). Our results indicate that RI, populations are responding positively to protection, but that factors such as the amount of reef area protected and proximity to reserve boundary contribute differently to RL responses. Our findings contribute to the design of MRs with respect to the habitat they protect and to a better understanding of the interactions between MRs and local fisheries.",0,2019,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.04.011,WOS:000472705200009,field,BA,2012,MPA,Taputeranga,4,young,2008,highly,NA,NA,8.54,medium,NA,NA,New Zealand,temperate,Oceania,South West Pacific,rocky reef,,,invertebrate,Jasus edwardsii,fished,no,artisanal,,fishery,food security,global,cpue,positive,yes,kg pot-1,figure 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,out because compares experimental cpue inside a reserve with cpue in unprotected area + historical vs contemporary values not explicitly given,,

Reducing such conflict of stakeholders has become an important issue during the initial stage of planning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). When it comes to promoting MPAs, cognitive differences and stakeholder conflict are the two main challenges Taiwan faces. This study collects data from in-depth interviews and consensus meetings, using the IBEFish framework as a systematic analysis tool. The result is that the concept of participation is still lacking among stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to integrate the concept into any discussion of marine resource conservation in both small areas and exclusive areas where environmental protection measures are being implemented. Furthermore, it is further found that emerges the relationship of dynamical balance between government agencies and other stakeholders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Disentangling the factors that contribute to effective conservation and improved human welfare is difficult, but necessary for understanding when these win-win scenarios are likely to emerge.

Efforts to expand the network of MPAs are contested largely due to historical injustices associated with MPA establishment and the ongoing social impacts linked with their current management and governance. This paper presents findings of recent research on the social dimensions of MPAs in five MPAs in South Africa. Drawing on information gathered from 70 oral histories, over 250 key informant interviews and 28 focus groups, the paper examines key social impacts respondents attribute to MPAs and their establishment and ongoing management. Significant negative impacts reported include the weakening of local governance rights and processes, in particular the lack of effective mechanisms for local community participation in decision making. The loss of tenure rights and access to resources amongst already marginalised communities has contributed to food insecurity, less exchange of food and less household income.

They are principally studied from a biological perspective, with some cases documenting improved environmental conditions and increased fish yields. The MPAs that meet narrowly defined biological goals are generally presented as successes. However, these same MPAs may, in fact, be social failures when social evaluation criteria are applied. A review of four MPAs in the Philippines and Indonesia demonstrates this scenario. The cases are reviewed using standard measures of biological and social success. Their historic and present management structures are reviewed. It is suggested that a strong linkage exists between social and biological success, with social considerations determining long-term biological success. This finding implies that standards for measuring both biological and social success should be applied equally and that MPAs should be designed to meet multiple social and biological goals. The evaluation and portrayal of MPAs has implications for the management of a particular MPA and the broader discourse surrounding marine environmental management.",269,2004,,WOS:000223814600015,field,BA,2003,MPA,Twin Rocks,14,old,1989,fully,,1.25,1.25,medium,yes,community-based,Phillipines,tropical,Asia,South China Sea,coral reef,,,,,,,small-scale,,mix,social organization,,conflict,negative,no,conflict between fisheries and dive operators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, MPAs frequently fail to achieve integrated, substantive outcomes. Participation failure is a common symptom of implementation failure. MPA experts often conclude that the remedy, in part, lies in better communication, with the implicit assumption that participation and communication are conjoined or synonymous. In this paper, the geography of communication in marine environments is analyzed as distinct from participation. It is argued that the logistical challenges of communicating in marine time and space must be taken into account beginning with the preimplementation stage of an MPA; this requires recognition and analysis of the political nuances of whose space, whose time, and whose terms for communication. Research in Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia determined that marine managers and local communities have divergent experiences of participation, prompting three insights. First, the timing of public consultations must accommodate the variable rhythms of life in fishing communities in order to ensure broad representation. Second, co-presence in fishers' space is critical for effective communication of marine knowledge and management strategies. Third, the deployment of 'participation time' by decision-makers communicates the value - or lack thereof - they place on fishing people and collaboration. The constructivist spatial analysis of communication presented here provides a model for MPA decision-makers and managers to identify, overcome and mobilize communication geographies that affect participation in sustainable development.

Based on local conditions, each FRCZ has its own management measurements arranged by local government (city/county government) in Taiwan. The Wanghaixiang's Chaojing Bay Conservation Area (WCBCA) had been set as a no-take zone (NTZ) trough bottom up approach. Thus, any kind of fishing gears are banned in the WCBCA, but more and more recreational activities come into the waters and intertidal zone of WCBCA. Thus the conflicts between local fisheries and recreational activities were becoming critical issues in the NTZs. In this study, we adopted in-depth interviews to collect the opinions about the management of recreational activities from different kinds of stakeholder (n=8) in the WCBCA. Based on the findings, most interviewees agreed that marine resources should be conserved and the WCBCA establishment can protect habitats, coral reefs and marine livings. Saveral interviewees mentioned that recreational activities should be managed and controlled though partition management, recreational carrying-capacity control and user payment mechanism. Also, several interviewees agreed that the areas of WCBCA should be extended. In addition, some interviewees concerned that fishing vessels cannot access the WCBCA, but too many scuba divers come into the NTZs, thus the disturbances caused by scuba diving were serious issues for marine resource conservation. Based on the findings, we suggested that the government agencies should make some arrangements to help the community involve in the management mechanism for well-operated the partition management, recreational carrying-capacity control and user payment mechanism for the WCBCA.

Harvesting reef fish for the global ornamental fish trade has provoked conflict since the late 1970s in the State of Hawaii. Two decades later the state of Hawaii established a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) to protect and enhance the fish resources and alleviate conflict between stakeholders, principally between commercial dive tour operators and aquarium fishers. The perceptions held by these stakeholders on West Hawaii and Maui were evaluated to understand how MPAs influenced conflict dimensions, as the former location had a well-established MPA network designed to alleviate conflict, while the latter did not. This was accomplished by analyzing the following questions: (1) perceptions about the effectiveness of MPAs to alleviate conflict and enhance reef fish; (2) perceived group encounters and threats to coral reefs; (3) willingness to encourage fishing; and (4) value orientations toward the aquarium fish trade. The results indicate the MPAs in West Hawaii were moderately effective for alleviating conflict, encounters between stakeholders occurred on both islands, dive operators strongly opposed commercial fishing and perceived aquarium fishing as a serious threat to the coral reef ecosystem, and polarized value orientations toward the aquarium fish trade confirms pervasive social values conflict. The conflict between these groups was also asymmetrical.

The failure to produce co-management will be related to the mismatch inherent in attempts to map co-management onto a histories and institutions that do not align with the morality and practicalities necessary for its implementation. The case reiterates the necessity for conservation managers and practitioners to have an understanding of local history and context. Lastly, Xcalak demonstrates the dangers for the success of conservation and development programs inherent in management processes that are inconsistent with built expectations. In so doing, this paper highlights critical assumptions made in the real-world application of co-management, as well as inherent conflicts found between local and extra-local moralities that guide conservation work.",16,2009,10.17730/humo.68.1.28gw1106u131143h,WOS:000264355500004,field,perception,2004,MPA,Xcalak,0,young,2004,PPA,NA,NA,130,large,no,co-managed,Mexico,tropical,Central America,Caribbean Sea,coral reef,,,,,,,,,,agency,,participation,ambiguous,no,overall conclusion of article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
