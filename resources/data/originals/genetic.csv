Estuaries and keystone species such as the seagrass, Zostera capensis, are under severe anthropogenic pressure and are often poorly protected. In this study we integrated Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data generated from populations of Z. capensis across the South African coastline into the spatial prioritisation tool Marxan. We included different measures of genomic variation to account for genomic diversity, distinctness and evolutionary potential to explore spatial planning scenarios. We investigated how conservation priority areas identified by targeting only habitat type differed from those identified by also including genomic measures; further we assessed how different genetic diversity metrics change prioritisation outcomes. All scenarios targeting genomic variation identified unique conservation prioritisation areas compared to scenarios only targeting habitat type. As such, omitting these estuaries from regional Marine Protected Areas networks risks the loss of evolutionarily important populations, threatening resilience and persistence of associated estuarine communities and their ecosystem services. We also observed a high degree of overlap between prioritisation outcomes across targeted measures of genomic variation. As such, by including even single measures of genomic variation, it may be possible to sufficiently represent the evolutionary processes behind the patterns of variation, while simplifying the conservation prioritisation procedure.",0,2021,10.1007/s10531-021-02184-w,WOS:000642068000001,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,only about design of MPA under different prioritization settings

Furthermore, little is known about the genetic diversity of maerl-forming species and the population structure of maerl beds, both of which are important for understanding the ability of these species to adapt to changing environments and for informing marine reserve planning. In this study, we used a whole genome genotyping approach to explore the population genomics of Phymatolithon calcareum, a maerl-forming red algal species, whose geographical distribution spans the north-east Atlantic, from Norway to Portugal. Our results, using 14,150 genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), showed that P. calcareum maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic are generally structured geographically, a pattern likely explained by low dispersal potential and limited connectivity between regions. Additionally, we found that P. calcareum from the Fal Estuary, south-west England, is genetically distinct from all other P. calcareum sampled, even from The Manacles, a site located only 13 km away. Further analysis revealed that this finding is not the result of introgression from two closely related species, Phymatolithon purpureum or Lithothamnion corallioides. Instead, this unique diversity may have been shaped over time by geographical isolation of the Fal Estuary maerl bed and a lack of gene flow with other P. calcareum populations. The genomic data presented in this study suggest that P. calcareum genetic diversity has accumulated over large temporal and spatial scales, the preservation of which will be important for maximizing the resilience of this species to changes in climate and the environment. Moreover, our findings underline the importance of managing the conservation of maerl beds across western Europe as distinct units, at a site-by-site level.",0,2021,10.1111/eva.13219,WOS:000634919200001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"no MPA, no control"

India plays a significant role in dugong conservation by having the largest population within South Asia. The status of dugongs in India is largely unknown due to a paucity of reliable ecological data. This study generated mitochondrial control region sequences from similar to 10% of dugong individuals from existing populations within India. Furthermore, data generated in this study were compared with the global data to assess genetic lineages, population structure, and genetic diversity of Indian populations.2. Multiple analyses suggest that the Indian dugong populations are part of a single genetic cluster, comprising South Asia, North-west Indian Ocean, and South-west Indian Ocean populations. Despite small population size, they retain high genetic diversity with unique mitochondrial DNA haplotypes within South Asia. Within India, novel haplotypes are observed from all dugong habitats sampled, with overall high haplotype diversity (0.85 +/- 0.04) but low nucleotide diversity (0.005 +/- 0.001). Indian populations exhibit genetic differentiation with higher within-population variance (63.41%) than among populations (36.59%). Two of the haplotypes observed in India are shared with Sri Lanka, implying genetic connectivity between these populations.3. The genetic data from Indian dugong populations provide critical insights into the identification of dugong corridors and important dugong conservation zones in India. We suggest site-specific interventions, including the creation of new marine protected areas and boundary reorganization and expansion of other existing protected areas, to ensure population connectivity. In addition, simultaneous efforts towards seagrass meadow restoration, reduction of dugong mortalities, and community participation in dugong conservation are recommended for population recovery of this threatened marine herbivore.",0,2021,10.1002/aqc.3490,WOS:000600790700001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Unclear MPAs and unclear control

Molecular and functional data have the potential to unlock information regarding the evolutionary uniqueness and resilience of natural communities, making phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) effective tools for spatial planning. These are, however, rarely used in marine conservation planning. In South Africa, MPAs have been implemented to protect rare and valuable fishery resources, such as members of the Sparidae (seabreams), but have not considered different dimensions of biodiversity, such as its phylogenetic and functional components. Here, we mapped species distributions, phylogenetic relationships and functional features of the Sparidae in South Africa to refine how biodiversity is spatially structured for this species-rich taxonomic group. Our results show strong spatial similarities between PD and FD, suggesting that, for this group, PD is an effective surrogate for functional data.

Anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems and organisms are steadily increasing. Whether and to what extent these pressures influence marine genetic biodiversity is only starting to be revealed. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analysed the microbial community structure of 33 individuals of the habitat-forming glass spongeVazella pourtalesii, as well as reference seawater, sediment, and biofilm samples. We assessed how two anthropogenic impacts, i.e. habitat destruction by trawling and artificial substrate provision (moorings made of composite plastic), correspond with in situV. pourtalesiimicrobiome variability. In addition, we evaluated the role of two bottom fishery closures in preserving sponge-associated microbial diversity on the Scotian Shelf, Canada. Our results illustrate thatV. pourtalesiisponges collected from protected sites within fishery closures contained distinct and taxonomically largely novel microbial communities. At the trawled site we recorded significant quantitative differences in distinct microbial phyla, such as a reduction in Nitrospinae in the four sponges from this site and the environmental references. Individuals ofV. pourtalesiigrowing on the mooring were significantly enriched in Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria in comparison to sponge individuals growing on the natural seabed. Due to a concomitant enrichment of these taxa in the mooring biofilm, we propose that biofilms on artificial substrates may 'prime' sponge-associated microbial communities when small sponges settle on such substrates. These observations likely have relevant management implications when considering the increase of artificial substrates in the marine environment, e.g., marine litter, off-shore wind parks, and petroleum platforms.",2,2020,10.1007/s10592-020-01305-2,WOS:000562340600001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not about intraspecific genetic diversity

A unique L. saxatilis habitat is represented by the sheltered rocky environment found in the natural coastal lagoon of the Cies Islands (NW Spain). The present-day characteristics of this habitat are relatively recent (similar to 70-150 years), some of these have been human induced. In this study, we indirectly tested local adaptation resulting in ecotypic variation in this habitat by estimating the additive genetic differentiation between populations (Q(ST)) for morphological shell traits in families of embryos. We compared the Q(st) and F-st (AFLP loci) between populations of the previously described Crab ecotype (outside the lagoon) and the new Cies lagoon ecotype (inside) as a proxy for adaptation. For several traits (RW1 and RW2; associated with a change in size of shell aperture) the Q(ST) was higher than corresponding F-ST, which indeed suggest that natural selection could be the force behind the apparent phenotypic divergence observed between the Crab and the Cies lagoon ecotype. The putative process of local adaptation occurring in the Cies lagoon ecotype (favoring a reduction of shell aperture) might be considered a case of fast phenotypic evolution driven by anthropogenic effects and with important conservation implications.

We characterized patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two reef-building corals to explore the eco-evolutionary processes that sustain populations in north-west Oceania. Our sampling focused on the unique reefs of the Kimberley; we collected the broadcast spawning coralAcropora aspera(n = 534) and the brooding coralIsopora brueggemanni(n = 612) across inter-archipelago (tens to hundreds of kilometres), inter-reef (kilometres to tens of kilometres) and within-reef (tens of metres to a few kilometres) scales. Initial analysis ofA. asperaidentified four highly divergent lineages that were co-occurring but morphologically similar. Subsequent population analyses focused on the most abundant and widespread lineage,Acroporaasp-c. Although the overall level of geographic subdivision was greater in the brooder than in the spawner, fundamental similarities in patterns of genetic structure were evident. Most notably, limits to gene flow were observed at scales <35 kilometres. Further, we observed four discrete clusters and a semi-permeable barrier to dispersal that were geographically consistent between species. Finally, sites experiencing bigger tides were more connected to the metapopulation and had greater gene diversity than those experiencing smaller tides. Our data indicate that the inshore reefs of the Kimberley are genetically isolated from neighbouring oceanic bioregions, but occasional dispersal between inshore archipelagos is important for the redistribution of evolutionarily important genetic diversity. Additionally, these results suggest that networks of marine reserves that effectively protect reefs from local pressures should be spaced within a few tens of kilometres to conserve the existing patterns of demographic and genetic connectivity.",1,2020,10.1111/eva.13033,WOS:000541504200001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"no mention of MPA, no control"

This study provides evidence of local genetic differentiation of P. volitans in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. A total of 475 lionfish samples were characterized with 12 microsatellites, with 6-20 alleles per locus. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were found in 10 of the 12 loci, all caused by heterozygous excess. Moderate genetic differentiation was observed between Chiriviche, Venezuela and Xcalak, Mexico localities (F-ST = 0.012), and between the Los Roques and the Veracruz (F-ST = 0.074) sites. STRUCTURE analysis found that four genetic entities best fit our data. A unique genetic group in the Gulf of Mexico may imply that the lionfish invasion unfolded both in a counterclockwise manner in the Gulf of Mexico. In spite of the notable dispersion of P. volitans, our results show some genetic structure, as do other noninvasive Caribbean fish species, suggesting that the connectivity in some MPAs analyzed in the Caribbean is limited and caused by only a few source individuals with subsequent genetic drift leading to local genetic differentiation.

This means evaluating their genetic population structure and gene flow, and the degree of connectivity among natural beds. To do this, the spatial genetic population structure of seven natural Mytilus chilensis beds within the mussels' present distribution range along the Chilean coast was evaluated. Genetic differences were established between populations with cytochrome oxidase I (COD gene sequences (Fst = 0.099) and microsatellites (Fst = 0.048), showing that locations that consistently presented greater differentiation were those at the extremes of the geographical distribution. An ""isolation by distance"" pattern was not observed in the COI and microsatellite data. We suggest that because of the high resolution of these markers, the differences between locations may be explained by high reproductive variance, which determines local changes in each reproductive cycle of the species. These changes would account for the differences between the natural beds. Furthermore, differentiated genetic types were observed in some locations, demonstrating the presence of local processes in some cases, perhaps caused by gene flow restrictions resulting from the local geomorphological and oceanographic conditions. The gene structure and connectivity of natural beds in sessile species with larval dispersion are strongly determined by local retention characteristics. For this reason, the data generated in this study can be used to improve population management. These data can also be used to support and motivate the creation of a marine protected area containing natural beds of this species with sufficient levels of genetic diversity.",0,2020,10.2983/035.039.0108,WOS:000526050800008,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

F-ST' and F-ST values are generally low, but significant. This was unexpected given the comparatively small geographic scale over which this survey was performed, approximately 2000km in an East to West orientation, even more so when accounting for the pan tropical distribution and long pelagic larval duration (210 days) of S. hispidus. Factors other than larval dispersal must be promoting population differentiation. In this case, genetic partitions appear to correspond to differing habitat types, possibly allowing selection to augment any oceanographic, geographic or biological barriers to gene flow, the resulting genetic differentiation is a source of evolutionary novelty and could facilitate reproductive isolation ultimately resulting in parapatric speciation.",2,2020,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151325,WOS:000520951000004,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

A prerequisite is knowledge of geographic structure and scale of genetic diversity and connectivity-the so-called seascape genetic patterns. The Baltic Sea is an excellent model system for studies linking seascape genetics with effects of anthropogenic stress. However, seascape genetic patterns in this area are only described for a few species and are completely unknown for invertebrate herbivores, which constitute a critical part of the ecosystem. This information is crucial for sustainable management, particularly under future scenarios of rapid environmental change. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure among 31 locations throughout the Baltic Sea, of which 45% were located in marine protected areas, in one of the most important herbivores of this region, the isopod crustacean Idotea balthica, using an array of 33,774 genome-wide SNP markers derived from 2b-RAD sequencing. In addition, we generate a biophysical connectivity matrix for I. balthica from a combination of oceanographic current models and estimated life history traits. We find population structure on scales of hundreds of kilometers across the Baltic Sea, where genomic patterns in most cases closely match biophysical connectivity, indicating passive transport with oceanographic currents as an important mean of dispersal in this species. We also find a reduced genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity along the main salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, suggesting periods of low population size.

Knowledge of genetic connectivity (gene flow) amongst populations of VME-associated taxa, such as squat lobsters, will contribute to ongoing management decision-making related to the protection of VMEs. To better understand the genetic diversity and genetic structure of squat lobster populations (Munida isos, Munida endeavourae and Munida gracilis) at different spatial scales (biogeographic provinces, regions and geomorphic features) in the southwest Pacific Ocean, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region and nuclear microsatellite markers were employed. Overall, the levels of genetic diversity were high for the COI region and moderate for the microsatellite loci across the three Munida species. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of COI variation revealed no significant genetic differentiation, whereas AMOVA of microsatellite variation revealed significant genetic differentiation amongst the three species, but at different spatial scales. Based on microsatellite variation, a range of analyses [Structure, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)] provided some evidence of limited genetic differentiation at different spatial scales across the three species. Low to moderate levels of assignment success (similar to 40-60%) based on microsatellite variation were achieved for the three Munida species, suggesting high levels of gene flow and possible panmixia. Nonetheless, for M. isos, populations from the Tasmanian slope were genetically differentiated from all other populations and may act as source populations, whereas populations from the Kermadec Ridge region may be sink populations for all three Munida species. Our results highlight the need to consider gene flow at trans-national scales when managing anthropogenic impacts on VMEs.

A network of appropriately located MPAs will have the potential to reseed fished areas and other MPAs. Connectivity studies are therefore important to assess the effectiveness of a network of MPAs and to determine the spatial scale necessary for spillover effects. The principal aim of this study was to determine the potential for Kenyan MPAs to reseed adjacent fishing zones by evaluating the levels of genetic differentiation of populations of Lethrinus mahsena, a commercially important fish, along a continuum of protected and nonprotected sites. Fish samples were collected from MPAs (Mombasa and Kisite Mpunguti Marine Parks) and the fished reserves adjacent to the two MPAs. Total length and weight of the fish from the sites and fin clips from one of the pectoral fins were collected and preserved in 90% ethanol. Genomic profiles for each sample were obtained through genotyping by sequencing using diversity array technology markers. Results from population structure, diversity, and admixture analyses indicated very low genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.00184, P > 0.05) and low population substructure between samples obtained from the study locations implying a free exchange of fish across protected and nonprotected sites. There was a high gene flow and multidirectional migration rate among the sampling sites. Inbreeding was moderately high (F-IS = 0.15, P < 0.05) in the marine parks, indicating high relatedness and probably limited mating options for the species due to small population size or spatial restriction. The lack of genetic differentiation between protected areas and open fishing grounds is indicative of genetic connectivity for the sky emperor. This reinforces the significance of maintaining protected areas to serve as breeding and spawning grounds of fish without adversely affecting the livelihoods of communities that depend on the various fisheries linked to MPAs.",0,2019,10.3389/fgene.2019.01003,WOS:000494433500001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not clearly genetic diversity

The species is an important commercial and recreational linefish species that is currently considered to be optimally exploited although there have been some signs of depletion within its range. This is likely because of its complex life-history including diandric protogyny and high residency, which make it potentially vulnerable to over-exploitation. This study analysed the genetic structure and diversity of E. andersoni using nuclear (intron 1 S7) and mitochondrial (cyt b) DNA genes for 240 and 269 individuals,respectively, to provide information for fisheries conservation and management. S7.1 allelic diversity was high (0.801) with the AMOVA showing significantly high among group variation (Phi(CT) = 0.204, p < 0.05) between five groups: I. Quissico to Inhaca; 2. Cape Vidal to Port Edward; 3 Port St Johns to Coffee Bay; 4. Mbhashe; 5. Port Alfred. This geographic structuring could be attributed to low gene flow across barriers such as the Port Alfred upwelling cell, the Mozambique Channel eddies and smaller more localised upwelling cells such as the Port St Johns cell. Contrastingly, the cytochrome b (cyt b) results indicate low haplotype diversity (0.309) and no differentiation (Phi(CT) = 0.265, p = 0.074) between groups, supporting the hypothesis of a historical population bottleneck. This may be due to an unusually slower mutation rate of the cyt b region than the S7.1 gene region suggesting more recent diversification. Complex patterns of diversity revealed by this study highlight that a precautionary approach is required for the management of this species that takes into account some regional differentiation, while some connectivity still exists, making it practical to continue to manage E. andersoni as a single stock.",2,2019,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.05.008,WOS:000477786600019,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no control

In this study, the tiger's shark mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced for a sample of 172 individuals from the western Atlantic and from Oceania's east coast in the Pacific Ocean. The results show a moderate variation in genetic diversity (h = 0.615 +/- 0.038, pi = 0.00184 +/- 0.00021) with a strong population structure between Atlantic areas (phi(ST) = 0.28141, P = 0.00001). The maternal lineage has high site fidelity, which paradoxically is coupled with connectivity across open ocean stretches to Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, which is identified as an important hotspot for this species. These results help with the understanding of what drives the displacement of this shark, at intra- and/or inter-ocean basins levels, and can help inform the implementation of future conservation and management measures. We recommend that the conservation of genetic diversity should be maintained at a global level and its maintenance should be pursued diligently in all populations of tiger shark. As the Fernando de Noronha region in the western Atlantic appears to contain the largest global genetic diversity of the species, this area should be treated as a marine reserve or ecological refuge for the tiger shark.",4,2019,10.1002/aqc.3029,WOS:000470934800008,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Up to now, studies on gorgonian ecology in the Mediterranean Sea have been focused mainly on the SCUBA diving depth range. Although increased availability of remotely operated vehicles allowed access to the deeper areas, gorgonian assemblages located on continental shelf and slopes are still barely known. Gorgonian assemblages on continental shelves are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, especially bottom trawling and longline fishing. To implement effective management and conservation policies it is crucial to understand patterns of genetic structure among populations since connectivity enhances the resilience of populations. Paramuricea macrospina is a key structuring gorgonian in the Menorca Channel's (Balearic Archipelago) outer continental shelf where it covers vast extensions, reaching very high densities. Combining two mitochondrial makers and 10 microsatellites, this study gives the first insight into the genetic diversity and population structure of P. macrospina between 60 and 100 m depth in the Menorca Channel and at a horizontal spatial scale of about 60 Km. Overall, we demonstrate a low genetic diversity and a lack of genetic structure among populations, which may be explained by the geomorphology and hydrodynamic features of the Menorca Channel (e.g. internal waves, high currents). Our study suggests some connectivity among P. macrospina populations in accordance with the high recruitment rates observed. This connectivity may increase the resilience and foster the recovery of impacted populations since the study area will become a Marine Protected Area of the Natura 2000 network in the near future. Nevertheless, complementary studies based on a larger sample size should be conducted to complement our results. In addition, temporal genetic monitoring of these populations should be envisaged to monitor the potential reduction of genetic diversity of this mesophotic species.",2,2019,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.024,WOS:000462100000042,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

However, uneven gene flow can result in gradients of genetic diversity that can affect population dynamics and management reference points and may contribute to over-fishing. We examined whether the brown swimming crab, Callinectes bellicosus, fished along 1200 km on the coast of Sonora (Mexico) is a homogeneous population. Based on previous empirical evidence of differences in phenology, we hypothesized that C. bellicosus has a metapopulation structure which needs to be included in management tools. We conducted a genetic study of C. bellicosus taken at seven sites along the coast of Sonora and obtained their microsatellite genotypes. Recent gene flow, as well as the role of each site as source or sink, were investigated. We found a latitudinal gradient in genetic diversity and identified sites along the coast acting as sources or sinks of migrants. Central sites act as sources, while northern sites are sinks; the main source of migrants was the southern-most site. A predominantly asymmetric metapopulation structure composed of local populations with moderate connectivity may be explained by larval dispersal in the northward oceanic current during the spawning period. Including migration rates between sites in a metapopulation dynamics model of C. bellicosus and considering that fishing and management decisions in source populations will impact neighboring populations located downstream can improve current management of this important commercial fishery.",6,2019,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.11.021,WOS:000458939000013,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Significant genic and genotypic differentiation was recorded for adults and post-larvae. This pattern was confirmed by correspondence analysis using allele frequencies. The genetic connectivity pattern was consistent with marine currents and dispersal models.

The species has been observed in intertidal and subtidal habitats from 0 to 40 m depth. The best available data indicate that pinto abalone abundance has declined in many areas throughout the species' range due to fisheries harvest. Subsistence and personal use fisheries in Alaska and a commercial fishery in Mexico persist. Preliminary data from 2008 to 2016 indicate signs of recovery for some pinto abalone populations along the British Columbia coast due to multiple contributing factors including a reduction in illegal harvest, natural recovery following fishery closure, and low predation pressure. By contrast, pinto abalone populations at the San Juan Islands in Washington are experiencing recruitment failure and continuing to decline, despite closure of the fisheries and no evidence of poaching. Throughout the remainder of the species' range, trends are less clear, due to the lack of regular, long-term monitoring surveys for pinto abalone. The limited data from surveys and/or opportunistic sightings indicate that pinto abalone populations are small, patchily distributed, and/or fluctuate episodically in Alaska, California, and Mexico, with evidence of recent recruitment in a number of locations within these three areas. Baseline abundance and trend data for the species before the advent of commercial fisheries and, in some areas, the local extirpation of sea otters is lacking. Without a clear baseline with which to compare the current abundance levels and trend information, it is difficult to interpret what these levels mean for the status and viability of the species. Threats to pinto abalone were evaluated and characterized using a qualitative rating (i.e., low, moderate, high, very high) based on the threats' scope, severity, and persistence and the sufficiency of the data to support the rating. Several threats that posed a moderate level of risk to pinto abalone were identified including the following: low densities as a result of historical overfishing; the potential threat posed by ocean acidification; and illegal take because of poaching and inadequate law enforcement. The overall risk that pinto abalone face throughout their range was evaluated, and it was determined that they have a low to moderate level of extinction risk now and in the foreseeable future (over both the 30-y and 100-y time horizons). There is a high level of uncertainty regarding demographic factors, in particular regarding whether abundance and productivity levels are sufficient to support the persistence and recovery of the species in the face of continuing and potential future threats. Although recruitment failure may be occurring in some areas (e.g., San Juan Islands Archipelago), in other areas throughout the range recurring and/or recent recruitment events have been observed, despite low densities, and have even resulted in increased densities (across all size classes) at several index sites in British Columbia. Limitations in using demographic data to guide conservation actions and help ensure species persistence could be overcome by conducting consistent monitoring of pinto abalone populations throughout their range.",1,2018,10.2983/035.037.0415,WOS:000454313100015,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

In the period 2009-2016,> 6800 cod from the fishery were genotyped with the PanI locus that is discriminatory between these two stocks. The estimated fraction of NEAC increased during the study period until 2014; however, it did not exceed 70% for any sustained period. Therefore, the MPA remained closed for commercial harvest. Genetic analysis of eggs revealed a distinctly lower fraction of NEAC than in the catch from the adult stock, both immediately outside and within the MPA itself. We suggest that this discrepancy is likely to reflect differences in spawning areas used by NCC and NEAC. Estimated fractions of NEAC/NCC using PanI, otolith classification, and 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms were similar, thus validating the use of PanI to estimate NEAC/NCC composition.",14,2018,10.1093/icesjms/fsx224,WOS:000434070900019,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Oceania linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across similar to 800 km. Genotype-environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global F-ST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.",38,2018,10.1111/mec.14526,WOS:000430919600007,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about localized adaptive divergence related to spatial environmental heterogeneity

Several loci displayed significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which appears to be common in other sponge studies.

With at least three main species targeted by artisanal fisheries in the region with distinct life histories, the lack of basic biological information about the distribution, metapopulation size and structure of each species could impede effective fisheries management to avoid overexploitation. We tested if different life histories of three species of octopus could help predict observed patterns of genetic diversity, population dynamics, structure and connectivity and how this information could be relevant to the sustainable management of the fishery. We sequenced two mitochondrial genes and genotyped seven nuclear microsatellite loci to identify the distribution of each species in 20 locations from the Gulf of California and the west coast of the Baja California peninsula. We tested five hypotheses derived from population genetic theory based on differences in the fecundity and dispersal potential for each species. We discovered that Octopus bimaculoides with low fecundity and direct development (without a planktonic phase) had lower average effective population size and genetic diversity, but higher levels of kinship, population structure, and richness of private alleles, than the other two species. These features indicated limited dispersal and high local recruitment. In contrast, O. bimaculatus and O. hubbsorum with higher fecundity and planktonic phase as paralarvae had higher effective population size and genetic diversity, and overall lower kinship and population structure than O. bimaculoides. These observations supported higher levels of gene flow over a larger geographical scale. O. bimaculatus with the longest planktonic paralarval duration and therefore larger dispersal potential had differences in the calculated parameters possibly associated with increased connectivity. We propose O. bimaculoides is more susceptible to over exploitation of small, isolated populations and could have longer recovery times than the other two species. This species may benefit from distinct fishery management within each local population. O. bimaculatus and O. hubbsorum may benefit from fishery management that takes into account metapopulation structure over larger geographic scales and the directionality and magnitude of larval dispersal driven by ocean currents and population connectivity among individuals of each locality. The distribution of each species and variations in their reproductive phenology is also important to consider when establishing marine reserves or seasonal fishing closures.",10,2018,10.7717/peerj.4295,WOS:000425362200001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Effective genetic management of species in the Baltic Sea is highly warranted in order to maximize their potential for survival, but shortcomings in this respect have been documented. Lack of knowledge is one reason managers give for why they do not regard genetic diversity in management. Here, the current knowledge of population genetic patterns of species in the Baltic Sea is reviewed and summarized with special focus on how the information can be used in management. The extent to which marine protected areas (MPAs) protect genetic diversity is also investigated in a case study of four key species. Sixty-one species have been studied genetically in the Baltic Sea, but comprehensive genetic information exists for only seven of them. Genetic monitoring shows genetic stability in some species but fluctuations and genetic changes in others. About half of the scientific studies published during the last 6years provide conservation advice, indicating a high interest in the scientific community for relating results to practical management.

Species diversity is more often reported due to practical constraints, but it is unknown if these measures of diversity are correlated. In marine invertebrates, adults are often sessile or sedentary and populations exchange genes via dispersal of gametes and larvae. Species with a larval period are expected to have more connected populations than those without larval dispersal. We assessed the relationship between measures of species and genetic diversity, and between dispersal ability and connectivity. We compiled data on genetic patterns and life history traits in nine species across five phyla. Sampling sites spanned 600km in the northwest Mediterranean Sea and focused on a 50-km area near Marseilles, France. Comparative population genetic approaches yielded three main results. (i) Species without larvae showed higher levels of genetic structure than species with free-living larvae, but the role of larval type (lecithotrophic or planktotrophic) was negligible. (ii) A narrow area around Marseilles, subject to offshore advection, limited genetic connectivity in most species. (iii) We identified sites with significant positive contributions to overall genetic diversity across all species, corresponding with areas near low human population densities. In contrast, high levels of human activity corresponded with a negative contribution to overall genetic diversity. Genetic diversity within species was positively and significantly linearly related to local species diversity. Our study suggests that local contribution to overall genetic diversity should be taken into account for future conservation strategies.",11,2017,10.1111/mec.14389,WOS:000418252300006,field,CI,2017,gravity,mix,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,France,temperate,Europe,Mediterranean sea,coralligenous,.,.,invertebrate,mix,unfished,no,.,.,.,.,.,contribution Cs,.,positive,yes,number,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,unclear which sampling sites are within MPAs or no but study clearly show that areas with less anthropic perturbations have the highest genetic diversity

Under United Nations resolutions, these corals require protection from human disturbance such as fishing. To better understand the vulnerability of stony corals (Goniocorella dumosa, Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis) to disturbance within the New Zealand region and to guide marine protected area design, genetic structure and connectivity were determined using microsatellite loci and DNA sequencing. Analyses compared population genetic differentiation between two biogeographic provinces, amongst three subregions (north-central-south) and amongst geomorphic features. Extensive population genetic differentiation was revealed by microsatellite variation, whilst DNA sequencing revealed very little differentiation. For G. dumosa, genetic differentiation existed amongst regions and geomorphic features, but not between provinces. For M. oculata, only a north-central-south regional structure was observed. For S. variabilis, genetic differentiation was observed between provinces, amongst regions and amongst geomorphic features. Populations on the Kermadec Ridge were genetically different from Chatham Rise populations for all three species. A significant isolation-by-depth pattern was observed for both marker types in G. dumosa and also in ITS of M. oculata. An isolation-by-distance pattern was revealed for microsatellite variation in S. variabilis. Medium to high levels of self-recruitment were detected in all geomorphic populations, and rates and routes of genetic connectivity were species-specific. These patterns of population genetic structure and connectivity at a range of spatial scales indicate that flexible spatial management approaches are required for the conservation of deep-sea corals around New Zealand.",11,2017,10.1111/eva.12509,WOS:000414952000008,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

However, increasing demand and exploitation due to the growing coastal population, export trade, and tourism industry are threatening the sustainability of the wild stock of this species. Because effective management requires a clear understanding of the connectivity among populations, this study was conducted to assess the genetic diversity and connectivity in the East African mangrove crab S. serrata. A section of 535 base pairs of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and eight microsatellite loci were analysed from 230 tissue samples of giant mud crabs collected from Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South Africa. Microsatellite genetic diversity (H-e) ranged between 0.56 and 0.6. The COI sequences showed 57 different haplotypes associated with low nucleotide diversity (current nucleotide diversity = 0.29%). In addition, the current nucleotide diversity was lower than the historical nucleotide diversity, indicating overexploitation or historical bottlenecks in the recent history of the studied population. Considering that the coastal population is growing rapidly, East African countries should promote sustainable fishing practices and sustainable use of mangrove resources to protect mud crabs and other marine fauna from the increasing pressure of exploitation. While microsatellite loci did not show significant genetic differentiation (p > 0.05), COI sequences revealed significant genetic divergence between sites on the East coast of Madagascar (ECM) and sites on the West coast of Madagascar, mainland East Africa, as well as the Seychelles. Since East African countries agreed to achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) target to protect over 10% of their marine areas by 2020, the observed pattern of connectivity and the measured genetic diversity can serve to provide useful information for designing networks of marine protected areas.",9,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0186817,WOS:000413568900045,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,unclear MPA and no control

Ecological marine protected areas (MPAs) focus on restoring or maintaining marine populations, communities, or ecosystems. All ecological MPAs - no matter their specific focus or objectives - depend for their success on incorporating ecological spatial connectivity into their design, use (i.e. application), and management. Though important, a synthesis of the implications of ecological spatial connectivity for the design, use, and management of MPAs, especially in the face of a changing global climate, does not exist. We synthesize this information and distill it into practical principles for design, use, and management of MPAs and networks of MPAs. High population connectivity among distant coastal ecosystems underscores the critical value of MPA networks for MPAs and the populations and ecosystems between them. High ecosystem connectivity among coastal ecosystems underscores the importance of protecting multiple connected ecosystems within an MPA, maximizing ecosystem connectivity across MPAs, and managing ecosystems outside MPAs so as to minimize influxes of detrimental organisms and materials into MPAs. Connectivity-informed MPAs and MPA networks - designed and managed to foster the ecological spatial connectivity processes important to local populations, species, communities, and ecosystems - can best address ecological changes induced by climate change. Also, the protections afforded by MPAs from direct, local human impacts may ameliorate climate change impacts in coastal ecosystems inside MPAs and, indirectly, in ecosystems outside MPAs.",34,2017,10.1002/aqc.2800,WOS:000409848000003,synthesis,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

To prepare for this threat, the Government of Palau is reviewing its marine protected area network to increase the resilience of the reefs by integrating connectivity into the network design. To support their effort, we used high throughput sequencing of microsatellites to create genotypes of colonies of the coral Acropora hyacinthus to characterize population genetic structure and dispersal patterns that led to the recovery of Palau's reefs from a 1998 bleaching event. We found no evidence of a founder effect or refugium where colonies may have survived to recolonize the reef. Instead, we found significant pairwise F'(ST) values, indicating population structure and low connectivity among most of the 25 sites around Palau. We used kinship to measure genetic differences at the individual level among sites and found that differences were best explained by the degree of exposure to the ocean [F-1,F-20 = 3.015, Pr(>F) = 0.01], but with little of the total variation explained. A permutation test of the pairwise kinship coefficients revealed that there was self-seeding within sites. Overall, the data point to the population of A. hyacinthus in Palau recovering from a handful of surviving colonies with population growth primarily from self-seeding and little exchange among sites. This finding has significant implications for the management strategies for the reefs of Palau, and we recommend increasing the number and distribution of management areas around Palau to capture the genetic architecture and increase the chances of protecting potential refuges in the future.",8,2017,10.1007/s00338-017-1565-x,WOS:000406954100006,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

Previous research highlights lack of knowledge among managers as one explanation to the implementation deficit. This multidisciplinary study builds on the identified need for an improved knowledge transfer between science and ongoing management. A basic knowledge package on genetic biodiversity in the Baltic Sea was presented as either a lecture or a deliberative group discussion to two separate samples of public managers who are involved in Baltic Sea and other biodiversity management at the regional level in Sweden. The empirical findings show that the communicated information has an impact on the public managers' beliefs on genetic biodiversity of the Baltic Sea.

Understanding the geographic distribution of cryptic lineages, as well as the spatial patterns of admixture among them, can have important implications for conservation planning. Here, we explore patterns of divergence in a coral reef fish, the neon goby Elacatinus lori, across the species' range. First, we use targeted amplicon sequencing to describe the spatial pattern of genetic divergence using two marker types (57 anonymous ddRAD-derived loci and mtDNA cytb). Second, we quantify the degree of admixture and hybridization between two previously-unidentified divergent lineages within Belize. Third, we assess whether the existing group of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Belize protects this cryptic genetic diversity. The results provide strong evidence for two divergent genetic lineages of E. lori within Belize, separated geographically by only 30 km of low-suitability habitat. There is a sharp genetic cline across these 30 km, and evidence of admixture and introgression at the boundary regions of the habitat break. We also show that the broadly-distributed arrangement of MPAs within Belize protects both major lineages as well as subtle structure within-lineages, and therefore may confer protection to co-distributed species that exhibit similar spatial patterns of divergence.",9,2017,10.1007/s10592-016-0895-5,WOS:000394253300016,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no control

Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish boxes (buffer zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls. (3) They maintain the natural size and age structure of the populations, hence maximizing potential fecundity, allowing biomass export to occur from core to regulated areas, dampening the fluctuations derived from deviations from the theoretical optimal effort in the fishing zone.",10,2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.0245,WOS:000457690600243,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,only mention of protection of genetic diversity

This genetic subdivision could be due to a 'sweepstakes reproductive effect' (i.e. only a small proportion of the available gene pool successfully contributes to the replenishment of each population). Furthermore, the lack of a pattern of isolation by distance, coupled with a low percentage of individuals assigned to their own populations, indicates that retention of larvae near the parent population is unlikely to be the main cause of the recorded genetic structure. However, we also found evidence of past demographic events in all populations, which may have played a pivotal role in shaping the recorded pattern of intraspecific differentiation.

Although fjord ecosystems have attracted much attention due to the great oscillation of environmental variables that produce heterogeneous habitats, species inhabiting this kind of ecosystem have received less attention. In this study, we used Sprattus fuegensis, a small pelagic species that populates the inner waters of the continental shelf, channels and fjords of Chilean Patagonia and Argentina, as a model species to test whether environmental variables of fjords relate to population genetic structure. A total of 282 individuals were analyzed from Chilean Patagonia with eight microsatellite loci.

Results showed two well-differentiated genetic clusters along the Chilean Patagonia distribution (i.e. inside the embayment area called TicToc, and the rest of the fjords), but no spatial isolation by distance (IBD) pattern was found with a Mantel test analysis. Temperature and nitrate were correlated to the expected heterozygosities and explained the allelic frequency variation of data in the redundancy analyses. These results suggest that the singular genetic differences found in S. fuegensis from inside TicToc Bay (East of the Corcovado Gulf) are the result of larvae retention bya combination of oceanographic mesoscale processes (i.e. the west wind drift current reaches the continental shelf exactly in this zone), and the local geographical configuration (i.e. embayment area, islands, archipelagos).

Epinephelus marginatus is a long-lived, sedentary, reef-associated protogynous hermaphrodite with high commercial and recreational value that is at risk of extinction throughout its global distribution. Based on global trends, population substructuring and gaps in local knowledge this has led to an increased interest in evaluation of local stock. Assessment of Maltese demography was based on historical and contemporary catch landings data whilst genetic population structure and regional connectivity patterns were evaluated by examining 175 individuals collected within the central Mediterranean region between 2002 and 2009 using 14 nuclear microsatellite loci. Demographic stock assessment of Maltese E. marginatus' revealed a 99% decline in catch landings between 1947 and 2009 within the Fisheries Management Zone.

The COI sequences generated 13 barcode index numbers (BINs) within Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), among which 11 were concordant with single species. DNA from similar to 6% of the larvae did not amplify using the primers tested; based on external morphological characteristics, these larvae represented four possible additional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the family level. Intraspecific variation for the COI and 16S rRNA genes was found to be < 2.6% and < 2.1% respectively (Kimura 2-parameter distance), whereas interspecific divergence ranged from 7.9% to 21.5% and 6.4% to 14.5%, respectively.

Although the knowledge about population connectivity is considered fundamental for the optimal design of MPAs and networks, the amount of information available for the Mediterranean Sea is currently scarce. We investigated the genetic structure of the saddled sea bream (Oblada melanura) and the level of genetic connectivity between protected and unprotected locations, using a set of 11 microsatellite loci. Spatial patterns of population differentiation were assessed locally (50-100 km) and regionally (500-1000 km), considering three MPAs of the Western Mediterranean Sea. All values of genetic differentiation between locations (Fst and Jost's D) were non-significant after Bon-ferroni correction, indicating that, at a relatively small spatial scale, protected locations were in general well connected with non-protected ones. On the other hand, at the regional scale, discriminant analysis of principal components revealed the presence of a subtle pattern of genetic heterogeneity that reflects the geography and the main oceanographic features (currents and barriers) of the study area. This genetic pattern could be a consequence of different processes acting at different spatial and temporal scales among which the presence of admixed populations, large population sizes and species dispersal capacity, could play a major role. These outcomes can have important implications for the conservation biology and fishery management of the saddled sea bream and provide useful information for genetic population studies of other coastal fishes in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

Many coral reefs within the CT and around the world are under threat from over-exploitation. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proven to be effective tools in restoring fish stocks. However, the role that MPAs play in promoting connectivity at greater distances through larval dispersal is still unknown. RADseq was used to discover 4253 SNPs from 81 individuals of the dusky parrotfish (Scarus niger) collected from three sites within the Philippines. A lack of population structure suggested a high rate of gene flow (F (ST) = 0.007). Estimates of N-e from linkage disequilibrium are relatively large, ranging from 1200 to 2000. A sibling analysis revealed one pair of well-supported full siblings (r = 0.773) and one pair of putative half siblings (r = 0.191) between sites separated by more than 500 km. The low F (ST) values indicate a high degree of gene flow between the reefs within the sampling area while the sibling analysis suggests demographic connectivity between the Sibuyan Sea and the Sulu Sea. The Mindoro-Panay throughflow is a likely vector by which larvae are transported between these sites, suggesting that reefs in Romblon are sources for reefs near Basay, 400 km to the south. Given the reliance of a vast majority of coral reef fishes on larval dispersal, this study reveals that MPAs established within the central Philippines can supply varying levels of larvae to overfished reefs.",12,2016,10.1007/s10592-015-0776-3,WOS:000368022900020,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity but connectivity

These tools now have the potential to inform fisheries management and species conservation, particularly for small fragmented populations under threat from exploitation and disturbance. In this study, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for a population of the anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus in the Keppel Islands (southern Great Barrier Reef). Habitat loss and fishing appear to have impacted this population and a network of no-take marine reserves currently protects 75% of the potential breeders. Using parentage analysis, we estimate that 21% of recruitment in the island group was generated locally and that breeding adults living in reserves were responsible for 79% (31 of 39) of these of locally produced juveniles. Overall, the network of reserves was fully connected via larval dispersal; however, one reserve was identified as a critical source of larvae for the island group. The population in the Keppel Islands also appears to be well-connected to other source populations at least 60km away, given that 79% (145 of 184) of the juveniles sampled remained unassigned in the parentage analysis. We estimated the effective size of the A.melanopus metapopulation to be 745 (582-993 95% CI) and recommend continued monitoring of its genetic status.

The aim of this study is to investigate population connectivity of P. argus at two levels: (1) spatially between two marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Caribbean coast of Mexico, and (2) temporally within MPAs; by genotyping discrete size classes lobsters using microsatellite markers. No evidence of population differentiation between lobster populations from Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka'an MPAs was found (P= 0.139). In contrast significant levels of population differentiation among discrete size classes of lobsters was found (F-ST = 0.0054; P=0.0052). Temporal variation among the genotypes of new larval recruits may explain these results. Future research will be required to directly test the genotypes of new larval recruits in Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka'an MPAs to confirm this hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seahorses are weak swimmers and have a brooded young, limiting their dispersal potential. They live in sheltered locations, which are physically isolated from each other. Therefore panmixia across their geographic range is unlikely. Hippocampus guttulatus, a seahorse inhabiting European waters, has a geographic range spanning a number of contemporary oceanographic features that are proposed barriers to gene flow. Thus this fish is well-placed to test the contributions of environment and life-history factors in shaping population structuring. This study found that mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA (microsatellite) genotype data are concordant in suggesting that, like many other small fishes in European waters, H. guttulatus extant populations expanded from at least one southern European refugial population. Subsequent population differentiation of four geographic lineages reflects contemporary oceanographic barriers to gene flow. Demographic analyses suggest a northward, and long-term isolation between Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea populations. Moreover H. guttulatus contemporary population distribution and population structure are predominately explained by historic and oceanographic influences. These findings suggest that conservation of genetic diversity in H. guttulatus may be aided by a network of marine protected areas (MPAs), implemented to conserve coastal habitats, but the species' unusual life history and gamete retaining behaviours should be considered as part of management decisions including MPA design and fisheries management plans.",13,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0728-y,WOS:000360940400010,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"not genetic diversity, no control"

Mitochondrial and nuclear markers were analyzed to investigate potential mechanisms impacting connectivity among and the demographic history of subpopulations of a commercially important species in the Gulf of California, the leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea). Demographic history and connectivity analyses included a coalescent analysis, estimating neutrality indices, estimating global and pairwise F'(ST), Phi(ST), or G''(ST), and a priori methodologies to identify genetically distinct units and barriers to dispersal. Average, long-term connectivity between geographic regions in the Gulf was also estimated. Divergence of mitochondrial lineages of leopard grouper dated to the late Pleistocene, with deep-water islands serving as demographically stable populations that may have acted as sources for new populations during periods of climate variability. Additionally, we observed genetically distinct units of leopard grouper in the Gulf, particularly between peninsular and mainland sites, as well as asymmetrical migration between the northern and central Gulf. Observed patterns of genetic differentiation are likely attributed to complex asymmetrical oceanographic currents and local larval retention. Based on our genetic findings and current fishing pressure in certain regions, we recommend implementing small, upstream no-take zones in the areas east of Isla Angel de la Guarda, around Isla San Lorenzo and Isla San Esteban, and north of Isla Tiburon, that would enhance connectivity among subpopulations, preserve sites with high genetic diversity, and benefit fisheries downstream of these sites.",6,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0702-8,WOS:000357285500005,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

These concepts include the extent to which the network maximises diversity (including genetic diversity) and the extent to which protected areas interact with non-reserve locations. To examine the consequences of different selection criteria, the preffered location to complement protected sites was examined using samples taken from four locations around each of two marine protected areas: Strangford Lough and Lough Hyne, Ireland. Three different measures of genetic distance were used: F-ST,F- D-est and a measure of allelic dissimilarity, along with a direct assessment of the total number of alleles in different candidate networks. Standardized site scores were used for comparisons across methods and selection criteria. The average score for Castlehaven, a site relatively close to Lough Hyne, was highest, implying that this site would capture the most genetic diversity while ensuring highest degree of interaction between protected and unprotected sites. Patterns around Strangford Lough were more ambiguous, potentially reflecting the weaker genetic structure around this protected area in comparison to Lough Hyne. Similar patterns were found across species with different dispersal capacities, indicating that methods based on genetic distance could be used to help maximise ecological coherence in reserve networks.

Given their prolonged (similar to 6 months) pelagic larval duration, population connectivity must be considered in any spatial management plan for P. argus. We used genetic techniques to uncover spatial patterns of connectivity among MPAs along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (MBRS) of Central America. We hypothesized that connectivity would be greater and genetic differentiation diminished among lobster populations within MPAs in the southern MBRS, which is dominated by a retentive oceanographic environment, as compared to MPAs in the more advective environment further north. We found that levels of connectivity are high among spiny lobster populations residing in MPAs in Central America, although overall F (ST) was low (F (ST) = 0.00013) but significant (P = 0.037). MPAs in the northern MBRS contained significantly more individuals that were genetically determined outliers or migrants than southern MPAs (P = 0.008, R (2) = 0.61), which may have contributed to the higher levels of genetic differentiation observed in northern MPAs. Direct genetic testing of larvae and adults will be required to confirm this hypothesis. The high level of connectivity among MPAs provides additional evidence of the importance of international cooperation in the management of Caribbean lobster fisheries. However, uncertainty regarding the ecological and physical drivers of genetic differentiation in Northern MPAs implies that managers should hedge against uncertainty.",16,2015,10.1007/s10592-014-0662-4,WOS:000351287400008,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

Despites its fisheries importance little is known about the population structure of the species and it is currently managed separately by both countries. The genetic connectivity between localities throughout C. puniceus' core distributional range was investigated using the mitochondrial control region and ten microsatellite loci. The majority of pairwise population comparisons were not significant (P>0.05) and none remained significant after Bonferroni corrections. While one AMOVA grouping using mtDNA found weak levels of structure separating Gaza and Inhaca in southern Mozambique from other localities, all other groupings for both data sets found no significant among group variation. Similarly, SAMOVA, Mantel tests (P>0.05) and STRUCTURE analysis using-In likelihoods were unable to identify genetic structuring through C. puniceus' distribution. MIGRATE-n analysis showed asymmetrical migration between sites with net migration probably influenced by the prevailing oceanographic feature. The results of the study failed to reject panmixia suggesting a single C. puniceus stock. The transboundary nature of a single stock coupled with the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of historical fishing effort likely made the species resilient to exploitation. This raises concerns as current management strategies are not aligned and the species is now harvested throughout most of its core distribution excluding the Ponta do Ouro, Maputaland, St Lucia marine protected areas.

However, it has been rarely used in the marine realm, where the adequate design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is urgently needed. Here, we examined the interacting processes underlying the patterns of genetic structure and demographic strucuture of a highly vulnerable Mediterranean habitat-forming species (i.e. Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826)), with particular emphasis on the processes of contemporary dispersal, genetic drift, and colonization of a new population. Isolation by distance and genetic discontinuities were found, and three genetic clusters were detected; each submitted to variations in the relative impact of drift and gene flow. No founder effect was found in the new population. The interplay of ecology and evolution revealed that drift is strongly impacting the smallest, most isolated populations, where partial mortality of individuals was highest. Moreover, the eco-evolutionary analyses entailed important conservation implications for P. clavata. Our study supports the inclusion of habitat-forming organisms in the design of MPAs and highlights the need to account for genetic drift in the development of MPAs.

We then asked whether MPAs favoured representation of phylogenetically and functionally more distinct species or whether there was a tendency to favour less distinctive ones. We finally evaluated the overall conservation effectiveness of the MPAs using a metric that integrates species' phylogenetic and functional relationships and targets achievement. The effectiveness of the MPA system at protecting biodiversity was assessed by comparison of its achievements against a null model obtained by siting current MPAs at random over the study area.ResultsAmong the coastal fish species analysed, 16 species were not covered by any MPA. All the remaining species only partially achieved the pre-defined representation target. The current MPA system missed fewer species than expected from siting MPAs at random. However, c.70% of the species did not achieve better protection in the current MPAs than expected from siting MPAs at random. Functional and evolutionary distinctiveness were weakly correlated with target achievement. The observed coverage of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity was not different or lower than expected from siting MPAs at random.Main conclusionsThe Mediterranean MPA system falls short in meeting conservation targets for coastal fish taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity.

Responses at each level depend on the tendency of fisheries to target larger body sizes and the tendency for greater reserve protection with less movement within and across populations. The primary population response to reserves is survival to greater ages and sizes plus increases in the population size for harvested species, with greater response to reserves that are large relative to species' movement rates. The primary community response to reserves is an increase in total biomass and diversity, with the potential for trophic cascades and altered spatial patterning of metacommunities. The primary evolutionary response to reserves is increased genetic diversity, with the theoretical potential for protection against fisheries-induced evolution and selection for reduced movement. The potential for the combined outcome of these responses to buffer marine populations and communities against temporal environmental heterogeneity has preliminary theoretical and empirical support.",41,2015,10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054424,WOS:000367292700003,review,mix,2015,MPA,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,,NA,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,.,.,mix,mix,mix,mix,.,.,.,.,.,overall outcome of reviewed articles,.,positive,no,NA,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Sensitivity analysis examined the influence of larval dispersal, and simulations included combinations of MPA location (which population was protected) and three fishing mortality rates for non-MPA populations: low (4%), medium (8%) and high (30%); no fishing was allowed in the MPAs.Results showed (i) salinity-driven changes in larval dispersal led to relatively small, population-specific connectivity changes, (ii) MPAs can enhance the frequency of genotypes originating within protected populations in unprotected populations when fishing rates are high (30%), and (iii) demographic shifts can impose temporal variability on the influence of MPAs on connectivity.These results suggest that genetic consequences of siting MPAs must be considered in terms of present population and environmental conditions, as well as allowing for changes in population and genetic connectivity that may shift fundamentally over time.Simulation results indicate that siting protected areas for oyster restoration in low salinity (<12ppt) regions may interact with development of disease resistance in the metapopulation by altering genotype transfer from protected to unprotected downestuary populations.

If persistence of live hard coral is a management goal, the existing protected areas within the Seychelles Bank may require review to ensure protection of sites with high recovery potential, while a suite of other management tools should be implemented in the remaining areas.

Once operational, reserves became popular with the public and provided economic benefits. In one reserve, 'spill-over' of lobsters counter-balanced lost fishing. The reserves provided the control sites that showed the effects of fishing on ecosystems through depleted populations and habitat change due to trophic cascades. Studies in other countries indicated that these trophic cascades were common globally. Research showed reserves protect benthic and pelagic species, including those that move outside the reserves. These findings benefited from reserves having a map of seabed habitats and data on the relative abundance of species of ecological importance. Information on other species (e.g. macro-invertebrates), and previous and nearby fishing effort over time, may have provided additional insights.Marine Reserves can provide benefits to (1) conservation of species and habitats, (2) science as controls for fishing effects, and (3) fisheries as reference sites that conserve natural genetic and population structure, host brood-stock, and provide spill-over to nearby fisheries. They should be distributed geographically in networks that include replicated examples of habitats and species.

Ed; Levin, Lisa A.",Population Connectivity Shifts at High Frequency within an Open-Coast Marine Protected Area Network,.,.,"A complete understanding of population connectivity via larval dispersal is of great value to the effective design and management of marine protected areas (MPA). However empirical estimates of larval dispersal distance, self-recruitment, and within season variability of population connectivity patterns and their influence on metapopulation structure remain rare. We used high-resolution otolith microchemistry data from the temperate reef fish Hypsypops rubicundus to explore biweekly, seasonal, and annual connectivity patterns in an open-coast MPA network. The three MPAs, spanning 46 km along the southern California coastline were connected by larval dispersal, but the magnitude and direction of connections reversed between 2008 and 2009. Self-recruitment, i.e. spawning, dispersal, and settlement to the same location, was observed at two locations, one of which is a MPA. Self-recruitment to this MPA ranged from 50-84%; within the entire 60 km study region, self-recruitment accounted for 45% of all individuals settling to study reefs. On biweekly time scales we observed directional variability in alongshore current data and larval dispersal trajectories; if viewed in isolation these data suggest the system behaves as a source-sink metapopulation. However aggregate biweekly data over two years reveal a reef network in which H. rubicundus behaves more like a well-mixed metapopulation. As one of the few empirical studies of population connectivity within a temperate open coast reef network, this work can inform the MPA design process, implementation of ecosystem based management plans, and facilitate conservation decisions.",11,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0103654,WOS:000339954800063,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

Population genetics can be used to investigate population connectivity. Combining population genetics with climatic, environmental, and biological (external) factors that can influence population structure and connectivity can lead to a greater understanding of the forces influencing population dynamics. We deciphered the population genetic structure and connectivity patterns of bay scallops (Argopecten irradians concentricus Lamarck) from Florida Gulf of Mexico waters using allozyme-locus and mitochondrial DNA population genetics data from samples representing four consecutive generations. We evaluated bay scallop population genetic relationships within the context of habitat, hydrodynamic, and environmental variation, and concomitant spatial patterns in the abundance of adult and recently recruited scallops to infer the influence of these factors on bay scallop population structure. Florida Gulf bay scallops form a hierarchical, mixed-model, source-sink metapopulation with intergenerational variation in connectivity that seems to be influenced by the factors we considered. An El Nino event that occurred during 1 y caused climatic and environmental change that greatly reduced subpopulation connectivity, allowing us to understand more completely the potential relative importance of the other external factors on change in metapopulation connectivity over time.

J.; Nash, Kirsty L.; Selig, Elizabeth R.; Bruno, John F.",Is coral richness related to community resistance to and recovery from disturbance?,.,.,"More diverse communities are thought to be more stable-the diversity-stability hypothesis-due to increased resistance to and recovery from disturbances. For example, high diversity can make the presence of resilient or fast growing species and key facilitations among species more likely. How natural, geographic biodiversity patterns and changes in biodiversity due to human activities mediate community-level disturbance dynamics is largely unknown, especially in diverse systems. For example, few studies have explored the role of diversity in tropical marine communities, especially at large scales. We tested the diversity-stability hypothesis by asking whether coral richness is related to resistance to and recovery from disturbances including storms, predator outbreaks, and coral bleaching on tropical coral reefs. We synthesized the results of 41 field studies conducted on 82 reefs, documenting changes in coral cover due to disturbance, across a global gradient of coral richness. Our results indicate that coral reefs in more species-rich regions were marginally less resistant to disturbance and did not recover more quickly. Coral community resistance was also highly dependent on pre-disturbance coral cover, probably due in part to the sensitivity of fast-growing and often dominant plating acroporid corals to disturbance. Our results suggest that coral communities in biodiverse regions, such as the western Pacific, may not be more resistant and resilient to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Further analyses controlling for disturbance intensity and other drivers of coral loss and recovery could improve our understanding of the influence of diversity on community stability in coral reef ecosystems.",16,2014,10.7717/peerj.308,WOS:000347564800003,synthesis,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Connectivity between spawning aggregations is thus assured by larval dispersal. This study looks into the genetic structure and gene flow among spawning aggregations of a large grouper, the gulf coney Hyporthodus acanthistius, in the northern Gulf of California. First, using the mitochondrial control region and 11 microsatellites, we calculated F-ST metrics and conducted a Bayesian clustering analysis to determine structure among 5 spawning aggregations. Shallow genetic structure was found, separating the southernmost spawning aggregate from the remainder. Second, we used the results from the structure analysis and local water circulation patterns to delineate 3 distinct models of gene flow. The best-supported model, in which the southernmost spawning aggregate formed one group and all other spawning aggregates were nested into a second group, was the one that was consistent with water circulation during the species' spawning season. Larval retention within a seasonal anti cyclonic gyre that formed during the gulf coney's spawning season may be responsible for the patterns found.

This review aims to address some of the perceived barriers to an enhanced approach that integrates molecular data into management and conservation goals, by reviewing papers relevant to both conservation and fisheries management in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly with respect to phylogeography, connectivity, and species identification, as well as stock delineation, restoration of depleted wild stocks, mislabeled marine resources and ""molecular forensics.""

These concepts include the extent to which the network maximises diversity (including genetic diversity) and the extent to which protected areas interact with non-reserve locations. To examine the consequences of different selection criteria, the preffered location to complement protected sites was examined using samples taken from four locations around each of two marine protected areas: Strangford Lough and Lough Hyne, Ireland. Three different measures of genetic distance were used: F-ST,F- D-est and a measure of allelic dissimilarity, along with a direct assessment of the total number of alleles in different candidate networks. Standardized site scores were used for comparisons across methods and selection criteria. The average score for Castlehaven, a site relatively close to Lough Hyne, was highest, implying that this site would capture the most genetic diversity while ensuring highest degree of interaction between protected and unprotected sites. Patterns around Strangford Lough were more ambiguous, potentially reflecting the weaker genetic structure around this protected area in comparison to Lough Hyne. Similar patterns were found across species with different dispersal capacities, indicating that methods based on genetic distance could be used to help maximise ecological coherence in reserve networks.

Using an interdisciplinary approach, we empirically assessed the design of a network of northern MPAs where fishing for European lobster (Homarus gammarus) is prohibited. First, we demonstrate a high level of residency and survival (50%) for almost a year (363 days) within MPAs, despite small MPA sizes (0.5-1 km(2)). Second, we demonstrate limited export (4.7%) of lobsters tagged within MPAs (N = 1810) to neighbouring fished areas, over a median distance of 1.6 km out to maximum 21 km away from MPA centres. In comparison, median movement distance of lobsters recaptured within MPAs was 164 m, and recapture rate was high (40%). Third, we demonstrate a high level of gene flow within the study region, with an estimated F-ST of less than 0.0001 over a approximate to 400 km coastline. Thus, the restricted movement of older life stages, combined with a high level of gene flow suggests that connectivity is primarily driven by larval drift. Larval export from the MPAs can most likely affect areas far beyond their borders.

However, these patterns and processes of genetic structuring are still poorly understood. The aims of our study were (1) to seek genetic structure at a small scale in Cerastoderma glaucum inside the Mar Menor coastal lagoon using a mitochondrial DNA marker (COI) that has previously detected genetic differentiation inside the lagoon in other species and (2) to evaluate the influence of extreme environmental conditions and habitat discontinuity on its genetic composition. The results indicate high levels of haplotype diversity and low values of nucleotide diversity. COI data provide evidence of significant population differentiation among some localities within the lagoon.

An understanding of red coral population structure, particularly larval dispersal patterns and connectivity among harvested populations is paramount to the viability of the species. In order to determine patterns of genetic spatial structuring of deep water Corallium rubrum populations, for the first time, colonies found between 58-118 m depth within the Tyrrhenian Sea were collected and analyzed. Ten microsatellite loci and two regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtMSH and mtC) were used to quantify patterns of genetic diversity within populations and to define population structuring at spatial scales from tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres. Microsatellites showed heterozygote deficiencies in all populations. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were observed at all investigated spatial scales, suggesting that populations are likely to be isolated. This differentiation may by the results of biological interactions, occurring within a small spatial scale and/or abiotic factors acting at a larger scale. Mitochondrial markers revealed significant genetic structuring at spatial scales greater then 100 km showing the occurrence of a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern Tyrrhenian populations.

One strategy, including resilient areas in marine protected area (MPA) networks, relies on information on the spatial distribution of resilience. We assess the ability to model and map six indicators of coral reef resilience-stress-tolerant coral taxa, coral generic diversity, fish herbivore biomass, fish herbivore functional group richness, density of juvenile corals and the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae. We use high spatial resolution satellite data to derive environmental predictors and use these in random forest models, with field observations, to predict resilience indicator values at unsampled locations. Predictions are compared with those obtained from universal kriging and from a baseline model. Prediction errors are estimated using cross-validation, and the ability to map each resilience indicator is quantified as the percentage reduction in prediction error compared to the baseline model. Results are most promising (percentage reduction = 18.3%) for mapping the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae and least promising (percentage reduction = 0%) for coral diversity. Our study has demonstrated one approach to map indicators of coral reef resilience. In the context of MPA network planning, the potential to consider reef resilience in addition to habitat and feature representation in decision-support software now exists, allowing planners to integrate aspects of reef resilience in MPA network development.",25,2013,10.3390/rs5031311,WOS:000316612000016,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

Biophysical indicators such as focal species abundance are often employed to assess the effectiveness of MPAs at meeting conservation objectives. We examined the dynamics of an Endangered beaked whale population 7 yr after the Gully MPA was established in 2004 off Nova Scotia, Canada. Northern bottlenose whales forage in deep water such as the Gully submarine canyon. Several MPA restrictions were implemented on the Gully ecosystem beginning in 2004 to reduce anthropogenic impacts including ship traffic, underwater noise and entanglements. This study represents the first intensive northern bottlenose whale population assessment since the Gully became a MPA. Using photo-identification data collected in 2010 and 2011, we applied mark-recapture techniques to estimate the current population size of northern bottlenose whales on the Scotian Shelf as 143 animals (95% CI: 129 to 156 animals). We also used open population models to examine population trends, and investigated changes in the sex ratio since 1988. Our results suggest the population size and sex ratio have been stable since before MPA legislation was implemented, illustrating the resilience of this population and suggesting that the MPA objective of preventing population decline is being met. Continued monitoring of MPA efficacy is necessary; there is still the potential for future events, whether stochastic or related to climate change, to affect small populations such as the Gully northern bottlenose whales and put the success of MPAs to further test.",14,2013,10.3354/esr00533,WOS:000325648800009,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

Since these networks will integrate existent reserves, an understanding of spatial genetic diversity and genetic connectivities between areas is necessary. Using Strangford Lough marine nature reserve (MNR) as a model, spatial genetic analyses were employed to evaluate the function of the lough. Samples of the marine gastropod Nucella lapillus (L.) from 7 locations in the reserve and adjacent areas were screened at 6 microsatellites. Genetic variation was temporally stable. Significant genetic structuring (F-ST = 0.133) was observed among samples. Genetic divergence and isolation by distance indicated reduced gene flow between the marine reserve and coastal samples relative to that between adjacent coastal samples. Partitioning of genetic variation between the reserve and coast was significant (AMOVA, 7.45%, p < 0.005). Samples within the reserve were not homogeneous, and genetic diversity decreased away from the mouth of the lough. Relative genetic isolation and reduced genetic diversity in the reserve may be caused by hydrographic barriers. A cline in genetic structure was observed in the Irish Sea. This is consistent with patterning of gene flow by predominant currents, habitat availability and seasonal oceanographic features. It appears that mesoscale topographic and hydrographic features drive patterns of genetic diversity, and these factors are likely to be important for understanding MNR function.

However, data on habitat requirements for most fish species are limited. Using a benthic habitat map that characterized reef habitats on the island of Hawaii, we examined ontogenetic patterns of habitat use by each of the life stages of endemic (i.e., Ctenochaetus strigosus; Ctenochaetus hawaiiensis), non-targeted species (i.e., Acanthurus nigrofuscus: Chromis agilis; Thallasoma duperrey; Paracirrhites arcatus) and targeted aquarium fish species (Zebrasoma flavescens; C. strigosus; C hawaiiensis; Chaetodon multicinctus) in relation to the effectiveness of existing MPAs designed to replenish aquarium fishes targeted by the aquarium trade. Our study empirically demonstrates that many species shift habitats ontogenetically while others remained in the same habitats as they matured. And among those that shifted habitats, depending on species, adults shifted either to more structured (branching coral in mid-depth aggregate and boulder habitats in 5 to 11 m depths) or to less structured substrates (shallow turf-rich boulder habitats in 0 to 11 m depths). In addition, this study shows how the spatial characteristics of the MPA (i.e., reef size) may be important to reef fish assemblages and ultimately the effectiveness of MPAs to replenish protected ornamental fishes. It is therefore critically important that the management and future design of MPAs provide sufficient diversity and quantities of habitats for all life stages of managed species in order to ensure the replenishment necessary to satisfy their conservation needs and management goals.

Comoros islands are an important biogeographic region due to potential richness of marine species, but no relevant information is available. In order to facilitate devising effective conservation management plan for T. maxima, nine microsatellite markers were used to survey genetic diversity and population differentiation of 72 specimens collected from three Comoros islands, Grande Comore, Moheli and Anjouan. A total of 51 alleles were detected ranged from 2 to 8 per locus. Observed and expected heterozygosity varied from 0.260 to 0.790 and from 0.542 to 0.830, respectively. All populations have high genetic diversity, especially the population in Moheli, a protected area, has higher genetic diversity than the others. Significant heterozygote deficiencies were recorded, and null alleles were probably the main factor leading to these deficits. FST value indicated medium genetic differentiation among the populations. Although significant, AMOVA revealed 48.9 % of genetic variation within individuals and only a small variation of 8.9 % was found between populations. Gene flow was high (Nm = 12.40) between Grande Comore and Moheli, while lower (Nm = 1.80) between Grande Comore and Anjouan, explaining geographic barriers to genetic exchanges might exist in these two islands.

In the marine realm, the absence of obvious barriers to dispersal can make this task more difficult. Nevertheless, recent studies have provided valuable insights into which factors may be shaping genetic structure in the world's oceans. These studies were, however, generally conducted on marine organisms with larval dispersal. Here, using a seascape genetics approach, we show that marine productivity and sea surface temperature are correlated with genetic structure in a highly mobile, widely distributed marine mammal species, the short-beaked common dolphin. Isolation by distance also appears to influence population divergence over larger geographical scales (i.e. across different ocean basins). We suggest that the relationship between environmental variables and population structure may be caused by prey behaviour, which is believed to determine common dolphins' movement patterns and preferred associations with certain oceanographic conditions. Our study highlights the role of oceanography in shaping genetic structure of a highly mobile and widely distributed top marine predator. Thus, seascape genetic studies can potentially track the biological effects of ongoing climate-change at oceanographic interfaces and also inform marine reserve design in relation to the distribution and genetic connectivity of charismatic and ecologically important megafauna.",61,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0031482,WOS:000301979000029,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

DNA control region. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated no genetic differentiation among locations within (empty set(CT) = 0.051) and among bioregions (empty set(SC) = 0.026). Phylogenetic analyses indicated no geographic partitioning within WA, though two distinct lineages were found. Within these two lineages there was no significant spatial partitioning, suggesting a panmictic population that can, under current conditions, be managed as a single stock. WA and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) population genetic data were then combined to determine the broad-scale connectivity between the east and west coast of Oceania. L. carponotatus from the GBR did differ significantly (F-ST = 0.64, p = < 0.001) from the WA population, indicating the two populations do not exchange any migrants and should be managed as discrete stocks. As an indicator of population resilience, genetic variability was compared among WA and GBR populations of L carponotatus and we show that the WA population has almost three times the genetic variability of the GBR population, suggesting that it will be better able to adapt to environmental change expected during the 21st century.

Coincident with accelerating degradation of coral reefs, expectations of the benefits that NTAs can provide for coastal societies and sustainability of marine ecosystems has grown. These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts.",58,2011,.,WOS:000293419200003,review,mix,2011,MPA,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,.,.,.,mix,mix,mix,.,.,.,genetic diversity,.,overall outcome of reviewed articles,.,positive,no,NA,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"small magnitude, low confidence"

Even though rocky shore invertebrates have been used as model systems to understand genetic structure in some marine environments, our understanding of connectivity in Caribbean communities is based overwhelmingly on studies of tropical fishes and corals. In this study, we investigate population connectivity and diversity of Cittarium pica, an abundant rocky shore trochid gastropod that is commercially harvested across its natural range, from the Bahamas to Venezuela.Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested for genetic structure using DNA sequence variation at the mitochondrial COI and 16S loci, AMOVA and distance-based methods. We found substantial differentiation among Caribbean sites. Yet, genetic differentiation was associated only with larger geographic scales within the Caribbean, and the pattern of differentiation only partially matched previous assessments of Caribbean connectivity, including those based on larval dispersal from hydrodynamic models. For instance, the Bahamas, considered an independent region by previous hydrodynamic studies, showed strong association with Eastern Caribbean sites in our study. Further, Bonaire (located in the east and close to the meridional division of the Caribbean basin) seems to be isolated from other Eastern sites.Conclusions/Significance: The significant genetic structure and observed in C. pica has some commonalities in pattern with more commonly sampled taxa, but presents features, such as the differentiation of Bonaire, that appear unique. Further, the level of differentiation, together with regional patterns of diversity, has important implications for the application of conservation and management strategies in this commercially harvested species.",32,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0012675,WOS:000281687300016,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,unclear MPAs and controls

Here, using three datasets that individually feature weak chaotic patchiness, we demonstrate that combining inferences across species and incorporating environmental data can greatly improve the predictive value of marine population genetics studies on small spatial scales. Significant correlations in genetic patterns of microsatellite markers among three species, kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus, Kellet's whelk Kelletia kelletii and California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus, in the Southern California Bight suggest that slight differences in diversity and pairwise differentiation across sampling sites are not simply noise or chaotic patchiness, but are ecologically meaningful. To test whether interspecies correlations potentially result from shared environmental drivers of genetic patterns, we assembled data on kelp bed size, sea surface temperature and estimates of site-to-site migration probability derived from a high resolution multi-year ocean circulation model. These data served as predictor variables in linear models of genetic diversity and linear mixed models of genetic differentiation that were assessed with information-theoretic model selection. Kelp was the most informative predictor of genetics for all three species, but ocean circulation also played a minor role for kelp bass. The shared patterns suggest a single spatial marine management strategy may effectively protect genetic diversity of multiple species. This study demonstrates the power of environmental and ecological data to shed light on weak genetic patterns and highlights the need for future focus on a mechanistic understanding of the links between oceanography, ecology and genetic structure.",215,2010,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04658.x,WOS:000281285200016,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated high levels of gene exchange between locations within (P. maculatus circle divide(CT)=-0.011; L carponotatus circle divide(CT)=0.004) and between each island group (P. maculatus circle divide(SC)=0.003; L. carponotatus circle divide(SC)=0.003). Phylogenetic analysis showed no geographic partitioning but identified two distinct lineages for both species that were distributed throughout the sampled range, suggesting that both species are admixtures of differentiated lineages rather than stable populations. This study shows that populations of both species within the sampling range are panmictic and under current conditions, they may be managed as a single stock across the entire GBR. Thus, the study suggests that the island groups and the no-take marine protected areas within them are connected by larval transport to each other and to fished areas.

Methods such as larval surveys, biodiversity assessments and fish tagging are not always successful at elucidating connectivity between areas.

P.",Connectivity and resilience of coral reef metapopulations in marine protected areas: matching empirical efforts to predictive needs,.,.,"Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.",213,2009,10.1007/s00338-009-0466-z,WOS:000265832100003,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ""representation"" objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.",227,2009,10.1007/s00338-009-0484-x,WOS:000265832100004,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no control

Overall, breeding colonies showed relatively high levels of genetic diversity at both nuclear and mtDNA markers (mean heteorzygosity: H-e = 0.598; mean allelic diversity: A = 7.11; mtDNA haplotype diversity: h = 0.812). A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance based on microsatellite data showed limited genetic structuring of breeding colonies, with 99% of the variation explained by differences among individuals and 0.7-1.0% attributed to differences among the three regions. The mtDNA analysis revealed higher levels of genetic structuring, with 3.43% of the variation explained by regions and 2.24% explained by colonies within the regions. Furthermore, a Mantel test revealed a significant association between geographic and genetic distances among colonies. The limited genetic structuring we detected is likely a result of (1) population intermixing through natal dispersal and (2) the large effective sizes of the reproductive colonies, both of which prevent genetic differentiation at neutral markers, balanced with (3) the regional association of breeding colonies to distinct feeding grounds and (4) a recent expansion of the population. Our results suggest that the demographic dynamics of breeding colonies of Magellanic Penguins may be framed under a metapopulation model, in which colonies with large numbers of breeding pairs could be considered ""source"" populations for maintaining the overall abundance of this species in the Atlantic Ocean.

Marine reserves can play an important role in the conservation of subpopulations of marine fish metapopulations. The population spatial structure of northern Atlantic cod of Newfoundland and Labrador has characteristics of a metapopulation. Subpopulations of northern Atlantic cod on the continental shelf were decimated by decades of overfishing, and have not recovered. The remaining northern cod are concentrated in coastal areas.2. A Marine Protected Area (MPA) was established in Gilbert Bay, Labrador by the Government of Canada in 2005 to protect the bay's resident subpopulation of northern Atlantic cod. Conservation of Gilbert Bay cod will help protect the genetic diversity of the northern cod metapopulation.3. Unlike some other MPAs, Gilbert Bay is not a harvest refugium or 'no-take' reserve. Aboriginal Subsistence fisheries for salmonids with a bycatch of cod are allowed in designated areas of the MPA. A recreational fishery for Atlantic cod by angling open to all people is under consideration. Management of the MPA must ensure that fishing activities do not endanger the local cod population.4. The population dynamics of Gilbert Bay cod were simulated using an age-structured Leslie matrix model to estimate the total mortality under various recreational fishing scenarios. The level of sustainable harvest by a recreational fishery depends on the natural mortality of the Gilbert Bay cod population, which is unknown. Therefore, there is risk in permitting a recreational fishery in the MPA.5. There may be benefits to the northern cod metapopulation, if the Gilbert Bay subpopulation is allowed to rebuild to the carrying capacity of the bay. If the abundance of Gilbert Bay cod exceeds the level which the local marine ecosystem can support, some cod may emigrate from the bay and recolonize adjacent coastal areas. The potential for Gilbert Bay cod to recolonize continental shelf areas is less certain.

A fully nested hierarchical sampling design incorporating three spatial scales (sites, location and regions, separated by 1-2, 10-50 and 70-80 km respectively) was used to determine genetic variability at seven microsatellite loci.

Reef fishes in NSW which have life histories similar to P. microlepis (e.g. pre-settlement durations a parts per thousand yen2 weeks) are also likely to exhibit genetic homogeneity.

Since these networks will integrate existent reserves, an understanding of spatial genetic diversity and genetic connectivities between areas is necessary. Using Strangford Lough marine nature reserve (MNR) as a model, spatial genetic analyses were employed to evaluate the function of the lough. Samples of the marine gastropod Nucella lapillus (L.) from 7 locations in the reserve and adjacent areas were screened at 6 microsatellites. Genetic variation was temporally stable. Significant genetic structuring (F-ST = 0.133) was observed among samples. Genetic divergence and isolation by distance indicated reduced gene flow between the marine reserve and coastal samples relative to that between adjacent coastal samples. Partitioning of genetic variation between the reserve and coast was significant (AMOVA, 7.45%, p < 0.005). Samples within the reserve were not homogeneous, and genetic diversity decreased away from the mouth of the lough. Relative genetic isolation and reduced genetic diversity in the reserve may be caused by hydrographic barriers. A cline in genetic structure was observed in the Irish Sea. This is consistent with patterning of gene flow by predominant currents, habitat availability and seasonal oceanographic features. It appears that mesoscale topographic and hydrographic features drive patterns of genetic diversity, and these factors are likely to be important for understanding MNR function.

While marine reserves are commonly used to mitigate risks to marine populations, the duration, size, location and larval connectivity needed for a reserve to help conserve genetic resources is still poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of fishing, reserves, and restocking on the genetic diversity of 10 populations from central Baja California, Mexico, and Southern California, USA. We demonstrate that each population shows characteristic genetic signatures according to recent management decisions. We found high allelic diversity, particularly rare alleles, a larger effective population size and a lack of a recent genetic bottleneck in pink abalones within a small (0.8 km(2)), recently established (5 years) reserve in Baja California, compared to other fished sites after a climatic bottleneck. Higher diversity may result from the presence of older animals in the reserve. Due to its location, the reserve may also act as an important hub connecting distant populations via larval dispersal. In contrast, a population from California showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the 1990s and their lack of recovery thereafter. In addition, a fished area in Baja California with a history of restocking for over a decade showed an increase in frequency of related individuals and high genetic differentiation from nearby sites that were consistent with the production of larvae from a few adults in the laboratory. A network of strategically placed small marine reserves that considers ocean circulation patterns could help to maintain genetic diversity and connectivity of exploited populations.

The most of them (20) were circumscribed in 1972 as the appenages of terrestrial reserves and were lacking of detailed scientific information, environmental background, demarcation and sustainable protection. This status cannot assure the conservation of biological and seascape diversity because of (1) fragmentation and small sizes of MPAs, (2) high environmental stress, (3) low level of protection, (4) inferiority of management, (5) imbalance of scientific needs and available research base, (6) excessive touristic and recreational activities, and (7) lack of professional and public awareness of the national and global actions needed to make effective MPA. The problems of MPAs in the Crimean coastal waters were reported in the governmental and NGO conservation programs. These documents contain some positive aspects concerning identification and inclusion of new protected sites into the natural reserve system, conservation and reconstruction of coastal and marine ecosystems, limitation of economic and commercial activity in critical habitats, identification and allocation of priority areas, etc., but they do not concern the creation and management of effective real MPAs. This situation needs prompt conservation-oriented actions directed for the Crimean coastal zone. The most important principles of MPA conservation strategy are(1) MPA should expand to the entire coastal region (ecosystem-based management) rather than be a system of new protected small seascapes or enclaves. (2) The creation of integrated management unit consolidating various forms and levels of marine environment conservation. The establishment of integrated MPA (Biosphere Reserve or Natural Park) in the Crimea coastal zone is the most preferable variant of new structure combining the various levels of protection: no-take cores (centres, units) including existing (enlarged) and new protected sites, rock islands, etc.; buffer protected zones (limited economic, educational and touristic activity), and human-affected habitats (settlements, objects of boat traffic, fishery, diving, tourism). Network or system of MPAs including a wide circle of marine habitats can be an alternative (or parallel) to this structure. This approach is widely accepted throughout the world. It includes bubble concept in extensive sea area, efficiency of environmental management, integrity control of ecosystems and habitat conservation, as well as guarantee of sustainable using of marine resources. Besides the network allocates key areas for migratory and transboundary species, and substantive linkage of activity between marine and continental nature conservation structures. (3) Recommendations need to have a workable solution: e.g., creation of new MPAs is desirable out of sea areas which are involved in economical activities (intensive industry, oil and gas recovery, commercial fishery); vice versa, preservation of wildlife, untouched ecosystems, remoteness from settlements and poor development of recreation are the favourable factors. (4) Integrated environmental approach should be applied for MPA creation: ecosystems, communities, populations, habitats and migration routes (but not only rare, endangered or endemic species) are priorities. (5) The conservation of biological and genetic diversity (including non-commercial and non-target species), and ecosystem productivity; prevention of habitat destruction and disturbance, overfishing and incidental by-catch are necessary. (6) The conservation program for Crimean rivers (including the pollution regulation) is the guarantee of MPAs existence.

In addition, because of their geographic isolation, HLRs may have poor or erratic larval connections to tropical reefs and a reduced genetic diversity and capacity to respond to environmental change. On Oceania's east coast, a system of marine protected areas (MPA's) has been established with the aim of conserving HLRs in part by providing sources of colonizing larvae. To examine the effectiveness of existing MPAs as networks for dispersal, we compared genetic diversity within and among the HLRs in MPAs and between these HLRs and tropical reefs on the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The 2 coral species best represented on Oceanian HLRs (the brooding Pocillopora damicornis and the broadcast-spawning Goniastrea australensis) exhibited sharply contrasting patterns of diversity and connectedness. For P. damicornis, the 8-locus genetic and genotypic diversity declined dramatically with increasing latitude (N-a = 3.6-1.2, H-e = 0.3-0-03, N-g:N = 0.87-0.06), although population structure was consistent with recruitment derived largely from sexual reproduction (Go:G, = 1.28-0-55). Genetic differentiation was high among the HLRs (F-ST [SD] = 0.32 [0.08], p < 0.05) and between the GBR and the HLRs (F-ST = 0.24 [0.06], p < 0.05), which indicates these temperate populations are effectively closed. In contrast for G. australensis, 9-locus genetic diversity was more consistent across reefs (N-a = 4.2-3.9, H-e = 0.3-0.26, N-g:N = 1-0.61), and there was no differentiation among regions (F-ST = 0.00 [0,004], p > 0.05), which implies the HLRs and the southern GBR are strongly interconnected. Our results demonstrate that although the current MPAs appear to capture most of the genetic diversity present within the HLR systems for these 2 species, their sharply contrasting patterns of connectivity indicate some taxa, such as P. damicornis, will be more vulnerable than others, and this disparity will provide challenges for future management.",43,2008,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00985.x,WOS:000260252000020,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,no MPA

Because of The bipartite life history of many marine species with sedentary adults and dispersive pelagic larvae, designing effective marine protected areas requires an understanding of patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity among geographically discrete populations. We used mtDNA sequence data to examine patterns of genetic connectivity in the boring giant clam (Tridacna crocea) in an effort to guide conservation efforts within the Coral Triangle. We collected an approximately 485 base pair fragment of mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) from 414 individuals at 26 sites across Indonesia. Genetic structure was strong between regions (phi(ST) = 0.549, p < 0.00001) with 3 strongly supported clades: one restricted to western Sumatra, another distributed across central Indonesia, and a third limited to eastern Indonesia and Papua. Even within the single largest clade, small but significant genetic structure was documented (phi(ST) = 0.069, p < 0.00001), which indicates limited gene flow within and among phylogeographic regions. Significant patterns of isolation by distance indicated an average dispersal distance of only 25-50 km, which is far below dispersal predictions of 406-708 km derived from estimates of passive dispersal over 10 days via surface currents. The strong regional genetic structure we found indicates potent limits to genetic and demographic connectivity for this species throughout the Coral Triangle and provides a regional context for conservation planning.

The analysis is based on a 456-bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I gene from 300 individuals collected from 15 localities across the Indo-Malay Archipelago.

However, the extent to which individual MPAs are connected remains mostly unknown. Here, we use a biophysical model tuned with empirical data on species dispersal ecology to predict connectivity of a vast spectrum of biodiversity in the European network of marine reserves (i.e., no-take MPAs). Our results highlight the correlation between empirical propagule duration data and connectivity potential and show weak network connectivity and strong isolation for major ecological groups, resulting from the lack of direct connectivity corridors between reserves over vast regions. The particularly high isolation predicted for ecosystemstructuring species (e.g., corals, sponges, macroalgae and seagrass) might potentially undermine biodiversity conservation efforts if local retention is insufficient and unmanaged populations are at risk. Isolation might also be problematic for populations' persistence in the light of climate change and expected species range shifts. Our findings provide novel insights for management directives, highlighting the location of regions requiring additional marine reserves to function as stepping-stone connectivity corridors.

D.; Abelson, A.",Local scale genetic structure in coral populations: A signature of selection,.,.,"Coastal marine reserves in general, and coral reef reserves in particular, are typically composed of scattered patches separated by uninhabited areas. Due to the sessile mode of life of adult corals, larval connectivity is often the only agent of gene flow between reef localities. In this study we examined the connectivity between populations of the common scleratinian coral Stylophora pistillata at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), using the rDNA ITS (internal transcribed spacer) as a molecular marker. Sequence comparisons among recruits indicated very similar, equally-diverse, assemblages of recruits in both the northern (highly affected by anthropogenic disturbances) and southern (less affected) study sites, implying a high larval connectivity or common sources of larval supply. By contrast, sequence diversity observed among adults declined sharply from southern to northern sites, accompanied by genetic differentiation of the respective populations. Based on Fu's Fs-test of selective neutrality, it may be suggested that various post-settlement selective regimes, presumably more intense in the northern sites, provide a reasonable explanation for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. The suggested hypothesis is supported by the sharper decline in sequence diversity found between recruits and adults in the northern sites. This study exemplifies the necessity to consider local selective factors, in addition to larval connectivity, when managing marine reserves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-anatysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection.

Dispersal distances and directions have a profound effect on gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. Genetic homogeneity over large areas is a common feature of coral reef fishes and can reflect high dispersal capability resulting in high levels of gene flow. If fish larvae return to their parental reef, gene flow would be restricted and genetic differentiation could occur. Larabicus quadrilineatus (Labridae) is considered as an endemic fish species of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The juveniles of this species are cleaner fish that feed on ectoparasites of other fishes. Here, we investigated the genetic population structure and gene flow in L. quadrilineatus among five locations in the Red Sea to infer connectivity among them. To estimate genetic diversity, we analysed 369 bp of 237 mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were higher in the southern than in the northern Red Sea. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected the highest significant genetic variation between northern and central/southern populations (Phi(CT) = 0.01; P < 0.001). Migration analysis revealed a several fold higher northward than southward migration, which could be explained by oceanographic conditions and spawning season. Even though the Phi(ST) value of 0.01 is rather low and implies a long larval dispersal distance, estimates based on the isolation-by-distance model show a very low mean larval dispersal distance (0.44-5.1 km) compared to other studies. In order to enable a sustainable ornamental fishery on the four-line wrasse, the results of this study suggest that populations in the northern and southern Red Sea should be managed separately as two different stocks. The rather low larval dispersal distance of about 5 km needs to be considered in the design of marine protected areas to enable connectivity and self-seeding.",38,2007,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03236.x,WOS:000245162700004,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,unclear MPAs and controls

This species has a long history of intensive exploitation, which has had a significant impact on population numbers in the past. To enhance our current understanding of lobster population structuring, genetic data from the mitochondrial (mt) DNA 16S rRNA gene was generated for 235 adult individuals collected at eight sampling sites. Most individuals (59.6%) share a common haplotype and 35 unique haplotypes were dispersed throughout the range. In total, 97.2% of the variation was found among individuals within sampling sites and 2.8% was among sites. Pairwise Phi(ST) analyses revealed shallow, yet significant structure between Hout Bay individuals and some other sampling sites. The J. lalandii haplotype network indicates a starlike structure with no geographic signal; however, genetic diversity sharply decreases towards the edges of the species distribution. The general lack of phylogeographic structure among J. lalandii populations probably results from the absence of strong barriers to larval dispersal.

Species endemic to small isolated oceanic islands such as the SW Pacific Kermadec Islands (New Zealand) are reliant on self-recruitment for continued existence. Population genetic studies in such isolated habitats can provide data on the extent to which dispersal limits the occurrence of organisms and determines their genetic structure. We used randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs) to examine genetic structuring and connectivity among populations of 2 intertidal limpets endemic to the Kermadec Islands. Significant genetic differentiation and limited connectivity were observed among populations of these limpets separated by less than 1 km, suggesting that a large proportion of successfully recruiting larvae do not disperse far from their population of origin.

Such diversity patterns include not only species distributions and interactions, but also variation in genetic diversity. Alongshore variations in allele frequency along coastal oceans are controlled by interactions between physical and biological forces. Here we model these interactions in terms of Lagrangian descriptors of nearshore physical oceanography, the life history dynamics of an individual species and habitat quality. This model allows us to define population boundaries within the species range as a function of ocean circulation, spatial habitat variability and larval characteristics. From this, we can find quantitative criteria for the persistence of regions of alongshore genetic variation. Our results show quantitatively that the existence of phylogeographic patterns in species with high dispersal capacity along uniform coasts with typical mean currents is surprising, and requires either strong selection gradients, alongshore variation in ocean currents and/or habitat quality, or a mixture of both. Our model suggests that marine reserves and the harvesting of marine recources can dramatically modify spatial gradients in genetic diversity.",67,2007,10.3354/meps335069,WOS:000246486800006,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,about connectivity

Some of the key life history characteristics that make modular marine invertebrates such as corals vulnerable to disturbance and stress are susceptibility to damage, slow growth, longevity, and philopatry. This may be particularly so for marginal populations at the limits of their range and, for instance, that are attractive to scuba divers.2. In this study we examined the population structure and incidence of damage, quantified growth rates and estimated gene flow to assess the effects of divers on the deep-water emergent populations of the fragile red coral Errina novaezelandiae in the Te Awaatu Marine Reserve in Fiordland, New Zealand.3. We found that population structure in red corals is skewed, with small colonies the most abundant. Damage was up to eight times higher in dived than in non-dived populations of red coral, and large colonies were more likely to be damaged. Growth in red corals can be high (up to 7 cm yr(-1)), although net growth is much lower (0.7 cm yr(-1)) due to the effects of partial mortality. On the basis of the slow growth rate, we estimate that large corals (> 20 cm diameter) will be in excess of 30 yr old. We also found high genetic subdivision among red coral populations and evidence of inbreeding, indicative of limited larval dispersal among neighbouring populations.4. Overall, our results indicate the shallow-water populations of red coral in Fiordland will be susceptible to impacts from scuba diving, and the development of a management strategy to ensure ecologically sustainable tourism and to minimize the effects of divers will be essential for their conservation.

Predicted benefits include increased fish biomass, increased species diversity, and enhanced recruitment to the MPA itself, as well as to proximal areas. Whereas MPAs have in fact been shown to increase biomass and species diversity, evidence of enhanced recruitment has yet to be seen. If MPAs are significantly enhancing recruitment, one would expect to see the recruitment dominated by groups of siblings arising from highly productive females predicted to eventually reside in MPAs due to the protection afforded them. If occurring, such sibling-dominated recruitment could be identified by significantly fewer mtDNA haplotypes and significantly fewer singleton haplotypes in population samples of recruiting juveniles compared to adult populations. We investigated a new approach for potentially determining whether MPAs might be significantly enhancing recruitment to proximal areas of Santa Cruz and the Santa Catalina islands in the California Channel Islands, by seeking evidence of sibling-dominated juvenile recruitment in mitochondrial DNA haplotype data of the kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus. Our analyses found largely genetically mixed recruitment from the plankton, suggesting that recruitment to the sampled areas was not being measurably enhanced from point sources such as the nearby MPAs.",8,2004,10.3354/meps277221,WOS:000224095900017,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

The use of marine reserves as tools either for conservation or fisheries management requires rigorous empirical evidence for the recovery of exploited species within them.2. The relative density and size structure of snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae), an intensively exploited reef fish species, were measured, using baited underwater video, inside and outside three northern New Zealand marine reserves (Leigh Marine Reserve, Hahei Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park) every 6 months from October 1997 to April 1999.3. Log-linear modelling showed that relative total density and egg production of snapper were higher in all three reserves than in fished areas. Snapper that were larger than the minimum legal size were estimated to be 14 times denser in protected areas than in fished areas, and the relative egg production was estimated to be 18 times higher. In the Leigh reserve, legal-size snapper were larger than legal-size snapper in fished areas.4. At the Leigh reserve, snapper density consistently peaked at the reserve centre and declined towards either boundary, which suggests that snapper became increasingly vulnerable to fishing towards the reserve boundaries.5. Inshore snapper density was significantly higher in autumn than in spring, supporting previous suggestions that snapper make regular onshore-offshore seasonal migrations that might be related to spawning. We suggest that the observed recovery of snapper populations within reserves is attributable to immigration of individuals from fished areas that take up residency within reserves, rather than juvenile recruitment.6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting an exploited species previously thought to be too mobile to respond to area-based protection. Although it is difficult to envisage significant enhancement of fished areas via adult emigration, it is likely that the reserves contribute significantly to local gamete production. In addition, the protection of fish populations within reserves might slow reductions in genetic diversity caused by size-selective mortality brought about by exploitation.",189,2003,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00775.x,WOS:000182118700003,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2-5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25-150 km.Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well.",756,2003,.,WOS:000181742700012,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,not genetic diversity

Recolonization and rapid recovery of genetic diversity in the Krakatau populations indicates that larval dispersal from multiple and diverse source populations contributes substantially to the demographics of local populations over intermediate temporal (tens to hundreds of years) and spatial scales (tens to hundreds of kilometres). Natural experiments such as Krakatau provide an excellent mechanism to investigate marine larval dispersal and connectivity.

Strong size-selective mortality from fishing has promoted an earlier age and smaller size at maturity in many species and a concomitant reduction in subsequent adult body sizes. These attributes are less economically desirable than those of fish from less heavily exploited stocks. We attempted to determine whether the establishment of marine protected areas, and the resulting relaxation of the directional selection produced by fishing mortality, would promote a substantial restoration of later ages at maturity. Our quantitative genetic models, calibrated with historical data from Gulf of Mexico populations of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, indicated that adequate variation should remain for life-history traits like age at maturity to respond to new fitness profiles. Marine species with planktonic larvae, including most economically important fishes, have high gene-flow rates that will preclude genetic differentiation between the no-take MPAs and the rest of the population. Any changes in the life history that are promoted by the no-take area may therefore ramify through the entire population. The establishment of no-take MPAs will promote substantial increases in the age at maturity if recruitment into them is not limited by density-dependent mortality. If it is, the benefit of no-take areas for increasing the age at maturity will be decreased. The no-take MPAs must serve as the major source of recruits for nearby fishing areas to produce the proposed benefits. The creation of MPAs will not replace the benefits of limiting age or size biases in harvesting by traditional fisheries management.",34,2000,.,WOS:000088894300023,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Losses of marine diversity are highest in coastal areas largely as a result of conflicting uses of coastal habitats.

Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.",46,1997,.,WOS:000168676500029,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,only mention of protection of genetic diversity

A high degree of connectivity between the TGMPA and neighbouring areas is in agreement with Lagrangian simulations, which indicate that white sea bream larvae can be transported over large distances up to about 300km. Trajectories released from the TGMPA showed that on average, 12.75% of the larvae remains within the TGMPA, while the rest travel south towards non-protected areas.Main conclusionsOur findings highlight the potential benefits of effectively enforced MPAs for neighbouring or relatively distant non-protected fishing areas and the potential connection with other MPAs at regional scale. Combining genetics and modelling can provide a general framework to investigate the role of connectivity in MPA design that can be easily extended to other species and geographical areas.",41,2013,10.1111/ddi.12116,WOS:000329778600007,field,CI,2009-2010,MPA,Torre Guaceto,19,old,1991,highly,NA,22.27,medium,yes,Italy,subtropical,Europe,Adriatic sea,rocky reef,.,.,fish,diplodus sargus sargus,fished,predator,.,.,.,.,.,allelic richness,table 1,neutral,yes,number,6.3,2,75,variance,0.0968,0.0968,6.06,8,223,0.082457143,0.082457143,0.038839833,Adults value not taken  into account

In the United Kingdom (UK), Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel was designated a No-Take Zone (NTZ) in 2003 and became the UK's first Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) in 2009. This NTZ is expected to represent an additional resource for the sustainable management of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) fishery. As the first step in a genetic monitoring program, this study aimed to investigate population genetic structure of lobster within and between the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel and in doing so to assess the functioning of the Lundy NTZ in the context of connectivity and other genetic parameters. Analysis of microsatellite data indicated that lobsters within the study area are genetically homogeneous and supports the view of a single panmictic population wherein the Lundy NTZ is highly connected. Levels of genetic variability were universally high with no evidence of differences for the NTZ. Furthermore, there was no evidence of recent genetic bottlenecks, and estimates of effective population sizes were infinitely large. The results suggest that if current management and breeding stock sizes are maintained genetic drift will not be strong enough to reduce neutral genetic diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The area is highly influenced by anthropogenic activities and is affected by eutrophication, climate change, habitat modifications, fishing and stocking. Effective genetic management of species in the Baltic Sea is highly warranted in order to maximize their potential for survival, but shortcomings in this respect have been documented. Lack of knowledge is one reason managers give for why they do not regard genetic diversity in management. Here, the current knowledge of population genetic patterns of species in the Baltic Sea is reviewed and summarized with special focus on how the information can be used in management. The extent to which marine protected areas (MPAs) protect genetic diversity is also investigated in a case study of four key species. Sixty-one species have been studied genetically in the Baltic Sea, but comprehensive genetic information exists for only seven of them. Genetic monitoring shows genetic stability in some species but fluctuations and genetic changes in others. About half of the scientific studies published during the last 6years provide conservation advice, indicating a high interest in the scientific community for relating results to practical management. Populations in MPAs do not differ genetically from populations outside MPAs, indicating that MPAs in the Baltic Sea do not protect genetic diversity specifically, but that populations in MPAs are a representative subset of populations in the Baltic Sea. Recommendations are provided for cases where genetic information is available but not used in management, particularly for non-commercial species with important ecosystem function. Improved channels for effective communication between academia and practical management on Baltic Sea genetic biodiversity are needed.
