Still, the magnitude and anticipated impacts of ocean warming are not expected to be uniform across marine space. Here, we developed a two-fold index-based approach to provide an integrated climatic vulnerability assessment of the marine surfaces which are enclosed within protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea. We first built a climatic stability index, based on metrics of analog-based velocity of climate change over a 120-year period (1950-2069), to assess patterns of climate dynamics within the marine protected surfaces. To provide a vulnerability ranking of protected surfaces under climate change, we combined this climate-related index with an index of community stability, reflecting the projected distribution shifts of 71 species of high conservation value. Our analyses revealed a highly heterogeneous and dynamic climatic space, with increasing but spatially inconsistent patterns of climate change velocities over successive 30-year periods. We found that about 62% of the protected marine surface might be subjected to low/very low climatic stability. About 70% of the protected waters were also found to be of limited community stability. Thus, protected surfaces across the Mediterranean basin were characterized by high vulnerability under changing climatic conditions, while only 5.7% of them exhibited high and very high stability based on both indices. Our findings suggest that combining information on climate change dynamics and biotic stability could offer spatially explicit insights which cannot be obtained based simply on the ecological dimensions of conservation planning.

Yet, the potential ability of MPAs to buffer effects of environmental variability at shorter time scales remains widely unknown. In the tropics, the yearly monsoon cycle is a major natural force affecting marine organisms in tropical regions, and its timing and severity are predicted to change over the coming century, with potentially severe effects on marine organisms, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here, we assessed the ability of MPAs to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on seagrass-associated fish communities, using a field survey in two MPAs (no-take zones) and two unprotected (open-access) sites around Zanzibar (Tanzania). We assessed the temporal stability of fish density and community structure within and outside MPAs during three monsoon seasons in 2014-2015, and investigated several possible mechanisms that could regulate temporal stability. Our results show that MPAs did not affect fish density and diversity, but that juvenile fish densities were temporally more stable within MPAs. Second, fish community structure was more stable within MPAs for juvenile and adult fish, but not for subadult fish or the total fish community. Third, the observed effects may be due to a combination of direct and indirect (seagrass-mediated) effects of seasonality and, potentially, fluctuating fishing pressure outside MPAs. In summary, these MPAs may not have the ability to enhance fish density and diversity and to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on the whole fish community. However, they may increase the temporal stability of certain groups, such as juvenile fish. Consequently, our results question whether MPAs play a general role in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning under changing environmental conditions in tropical seagrass fish communities.",6,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0183999,WOS:000408693600076,field,CI,2014-2015,MPA,mix,13 and 21,old,1994 and 2002,fully,1 to 3,mix,mix,small,NA,Tanzania,tropical,Africa,Indian Ocean,mix,NA,ecological,fish,mix,mix,mix,,,,variability,,distance to centroid,stability,figure 8,positive,yes,NA,confidence interval 95%,,,,,,,,,0.1904,60,0.176,0.6955562,0.27,51.00,0.18,0.6529306,0.338870319,,

However, they face threats from anthropogenic activities, including poor water quality, global warming, coastal development and unsustainable fisheries. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide a structured and holistic approach in addressing these threats. Regular monitoring and assessment of these MPAs are crucial components in evaluating the MPAs design and effectiveness. Two coral reefs (i.e. Poblacion and Kadurong Reefs) were established as MPAs in Liloan, Cebu, Philippines to protect crucial habitat and biodiversity with the hope of improving fisheries by avoiding fish stock disintegration. These coral reefs provide shelter to many commercially-significant fish species, supporting subsistence and livelihood in the community. These MPAs are not only biologically rich, but they also support socio-economic stability. Hence, management and protection of the coral reefs in the MPAs of Liloan, Cebu is of paramount importance. To formulate conservation and applicable management measures, research and monitoring should be in place. This paper presents the data collected from the short term monitoring in the Poblaction and Kadurong Reefs.

Adequately implemented protected areas (PAs) aim to promote conservation by increasing population size and reducing its variability. To resolve how these effects depend on PA features, I develop and analyze new models of stochastic processes that encompass the fluctuations generated by demographic or environmental stochasticity in PAs management. The stochastic model is built upon individual processes. In the model, density-independent mortality, migration between PAs and non-PAs, organism preference for PAs, and size characterize the features of the PA. The effect of PAs size is also examined. The long-term conservation effects are quantified using the coefficient of variation (CV) of population size in PAs, where a lower CV indicates higher robustness in stochastic variations. The results from this study demonstrate that sufficiently reduced density-independent mortality in PAs and high site preference for PAs and immigration rate into PAs are likely to decrease the CV. However, different types of stochasticity induce rather different consequences: under demographic stochasticity, the CV is always reduced because PAs increase the population size therein, but an increased population size by PAs does not always decrease the CV under environmental stochasticity. The deterministic dynamics of the model are investigated, facilitating effective management decisions.</p>",0,2021,10.3389/fevo.2021.672608,WOS:000697972900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using underwater visual census (UVC) and photo-identification (photo-ID) techniques, we estimated the abundance, residency and site fidelity of the dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, at two protected sites within the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (Sardinia, Italy) in the summers of 2017-2018. The scope and spatio-temporal resolution of the study was extended by involving volunteer recreational divers in the photo collection.

Beside effective enforcement, an accurate understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity is needed to reap the benefits of management policies. In this context, integrating population genetics with demographic data, the demo-genetic approach, is particularly relevant to shift from a species-based pattern toward an eco-evolutionarybased processes conservation. Here, targeting a key species in the Mediterranean coralligenous, the red coral, Corallium rubrum, in an emblematic Mediterranean MPA, the Reserve Naturelle de Scandola (France), we applied demo-genetic approaches at two contrasted spatial scales, among populations and within one population, to (i) infer the demographic connectivity among populations in the metapopulation network and (ii) shed new light on the genetic connectivity and on the demographic transitions underlying the dynamics of a near-pristine population. Integrating different spatial and temporal scales, we demonstrated (i) an apparent temporal stability in the pattern of genetic diversity and structure in the MPA in spite of a dramatic demographic decline and (ii) contrasted levels of genetic isolation but substantial demographic connectivity among populations. Focusing on the near-pristine population, we complemented the characterization of red coral demographic connectivity suggesting (iii) temporal variability and (iv) the occurrence of collective dispersal. In addition, we demonstrated (v) contrasted patterns of spatial genetic structure (SGS), depending on the considered stage-class (adults vs. juveniles), in the near-pristine population. This last result points out that the overall SGS resulted from a restricted dispersal of locally produced juveniles (SGS among adults and juveniles) combined to mortality during early life stages (decrease of SGS from juveniles to adults). Demonstrating the occurrence of two management units and the importance of two populations (CAVB and ALE) for the network of connectivity, we made recommendations for the management of the Reserve Naturelle de Scandola.

We used mid-water stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) and spatial predictive models to characterize the pelagic wildlife assemblage at the head of the Perth Canyon, one of the largest submarine canyons in Australia, over a 7-yr period (2013-2019).

The model is original because it considers a nonlinear harvesting function assumed to depend upon stock size and fishing effort with a saturation effect with respect to the resource as well as a price equation depending on demand and supply which is in addition proportional to price. Assuming that the price varies at a fast time scale, we are able to use ?ag-gregation of variables methods? in order to reduce the model in a two dimensional model at a slow time scale. This aggregated (reduced) model is analyzed. Several numerical simulations of the model are performed to substantiate our analytical findings. The existence of nonlinear harvesting makes the dynamics of the model more complicated, including multiple equilibria, bi-stability and limit cycle.

Favourable environmental conditions to visually detect whale sharks have been defined for the studied area. Accordingly, a total of 1077 shark encounters have been analysed in this study. Environmental conditions (i.e. sea surface temperature, monsoon occurrence) have been used to detect possible factors affecting the spatial and temporal variability of Rhincodon typus aggregations. A two-way ANOVA has been performed to detect temporal trends in animal occurrence, sea surface temperature pattern and to investigate the sea bottom depth variability during encounters. Significant differences in the monthly occurrence of whale sharks within the same year and among different years have been detected. Similar patterns have been observed for environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature and depth. A different spatial distribution has also been detected as a function of the Indian Monsoon reversal (north-eastern and south-western) affecting the area.

In these remote areas, biomass was weakly associated with human travel time to the site and, to a lesser extent, wave energy. In high-compliance closures, fish biomass peaked at 20 years and 5-10 km(2), and levelled at 910 kg ha(-1) (95% CI 823-989 kg ha(-1)) for both closure age and size. There was little evidence that human travel time and environmental factors influenced biomass greatly in these established closures. In small and recent closures (<15 years), habitat, depth and closure age were the best predictors of fish biomass.6. Based on the weakness of environmental factors, country or site-specific B&Bs are not required in these two provinces. However, human habitation in the seascape as well as the size and age of closures set limits to the maximum achievable biomass. The importance of environmental factors increases as the no-fishing areas and closure times decline. Reef wilderness is not widespread in these provinces, but provides key services and therefore needs to be included in conservation and fisheries policy and management goals.",4,2021,10.1002/aqc.3448,WOS:000575016800001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few long-term field tests exist of how fishing affects the trophic structure of coral reef fish assemblages, and how such changes affect the benthos. Alternatively, benthic change itself may drive the trophic structure of reef fish assemblages. Reef fish trophic structure and benthic cover were quantified almost annually from 1983 to 2014 at two small Philippine islands (Apo, Sumilon). At each island a No-Take Marine Reserve (NTMR) site and a site open to subsistence reef fishing were monitored. Thirteen trophic groups were identified. Large planktivores often accounted for >50% of assemblage biomass. Significant NTMR effects were detected at each island for total fish biomass, but for only 2 of 13 trophic components: generalist large predators and large planktivores. Fishing-induced changes in biomass of these components had no effect on live hard coral (HC) cover. In contrast, HC cover affected biomass of 11 of 13 trophic components significantly. Positive associations with HC cover were detected for total fish biomass, generalist large predators, piscivores, obligate coral feeders, large planktivores, and small planktivores. Negative associations with HC cover were detected for large benthic foragers, detritivores, excavators, scrapers, and sand feeders. These associations of fish biomass to HC cover were most clear when environmental disturbances (e.g., coral bleaching, typhoons) reduced HC cover, often quickly (1-2 yr), and when HC recovered, often slowly (5-10 yr). As HC cover changed, the biomass of 11 trophic components of the fish assemblage changed. Benthic and fish assemblages were distinct at all sites from the outset, remaining so for 31 yr, despite differences in fishing pressure and disturbance history. HC cover alone explained similar to 30% of the variability in reef fish trophic structure, whereas fishing alone explained 24%. Furthermore, HC cover affected more trophic groups more strongly than fishing. Management of coral reefs must include measures to maintain coral reef habitats, not just measures to reduce fishing by NTMRs.",11,2021,10.1002/eap.2224,WOS:000574574400001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grazing by sea urchins is one of numerous physical and biotic factors that leads to geographic variation in community structure on rocky reefs worldwide. We describe patterns of abundance, distribution, and trophic interactions of urchins and their predators on subtidal rocky reefs across much of their range in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Surveys and tethering experiments were conducted between Point Conception, California, USA, and Bahia Asuncion, Baja California Sur, Mexico, including both fished areas and marine protected areas (MPAs). Variability in abundance was greatest at the smallest spatial scales (transects and sites) rather than the largest spatial scale (regions); however, we found correlative evidence of region-wide top-down control in which higher densities of predators (primarily spiny lobsters) led to increased abundances of kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Similarly, urchin survival varied regionally, with survival rates increasing from south to north. The effect of MPAs was less clear: species abundances varied between individual MPAs, but there were no clear differences in urchin survival between MPAs and fished areas. Community structure of rocky reefs in this region varies substantially among sites and appears to be driven in some locations by predators and in others by factors that obscure the importance of trophic interactions. Our study provides empirical evidence of the variability in top-down forcing in these communities and cautions against making broad generalizations based on inferences from local-scale studies.",1,2020,10.3354/meps13437,WOS:000621222200004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study presents results based on a 9 year (2008-2017) underwater visual census monitoring study to evaluate the density and biomass of key fish species. Variations in density and biomass were detected for most species. Factors and mechanisms that may have influenced spatial variation are habitat structural complexity and protection from fisheries. Temporal variations, otherwise, may have been influenced by species proximity to their distributional limit, in synergy with density-dependent mechanisms and stochastic winter temperature oscillations.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a potential tool to protect older, larger individuals and therefore mitigate such ecological and evolutionary effects of harvest, depending on the degree of connectivity among areas. Such MPA protection relies on a shift in size-dependent mortality, the measurement of which can therefore serve as an early indicator of whether MPAs might achieve the desired longer-term ecological and evolutionary responses. We directly measured MPA effects on size-selective mortality and associated size structure using mark-recapture data on European lobster (Homarus gammarus) collected at three MPA-control area pairs in southern Norway during one decade (n = 5,943). Mark-recapture modeling, accounting for variation in recapture probabilities, revealed (1) that annual mean survival was higher inside MPAs (0.592) vs. control areas (0.298) and (2) that significant negative relationships between survival and body size occurred at the control areas but not in the MPAs, where the effect of body size was predominantly positive.

IW and DG trajectories differed primarily according to the habitat sampled and sprats' hatching seasons. Overall, strong coupling was detected between IW and DG trajectories with SST in both habitats.

This paper aims to estimate the variability of the coral assemblage structure at different spatial scales in order to determine which scales explain the largest variability on beta-diversity. For this, a fully-nested design including a series of hierarchical-random factors encompassing three spatial scales: (1) regions, (2) localities and (3) reefs sites across the Venezuelan territory. The variability among spatial scales was tested with a permutation-based analysis of variance (Permanova) based on Bray-Curtis index. Dispersion in species presence/absence across scales (i.e., beta-diversity) was tested with a PermDisp analysis based on Jaccard's index. We found the highest variability in the coral assemblage structure between sites within localities (Pseudo-F = 5.34; p-value = 0.001, CV = 35.10%). We also found that longitude (Canonical corr = 0.867, p = 0.001) is a better predictor of the coral assemblage structure in Venezuela, than latitude (Canonical corr = 0.552, p = 0.021). Largest changes in beta-diversity of corals occurred within sites (F = 2.764, df1 = 35, df2 = 107, p = 0.045) and within localities (F = 4.438, df1 = 6, df2 = 29, p = 0.026). Our results suggest that processes operating at spatial scales of hundreds of meters and hundreds of kilometers might both be critical to shape coral assemblage structure in Venezuela, whereas smaller scales (i.e., hundreds of meters) showed to be highly-important for the species turnover component of beta-diversity.

Although MUMPAs have produced benefits around the world, the persistence of moderate fishing pressure reduces the likelihood of achieving the primary objective of these areas, which is the conservation of ecosystems. In this study we used traditional and functional metrics to evaluate how fish assemblages changed through time in a MUMPA, including shifts in species responses and in ecological processes. We conducted visual censuses of fishes at Espiritu Santo Island, Mexico (MUMPA; N D 320; 24 degrees N, 110 degrees W) from 2005 to 2017 to assess fish richness, size-distribution and density. Three functional indices were calculated using six traits (size, mobility, period of activity, aggregation, position in water column and diet): functional richness (volume occupied by species), dispersion (complementarity between species) and originality (inverse of functional redundancy). We compared fish diversity among three management zone types (sustainable fishing, traditional fishing and no-take zones), through a 13-year period, assessing which species increased or decreased in occurrence, density, and biomass, and how indices respond over time. Despite a general increase in biomass and stability in density and originality, we detected a reduction in fish biodiversity in the form of declines in species and functional richness, which could imply the risk of local extinction and decrease in certain ecosystem processes. In addition, changes in functional dispersion showed that some functions are losing representation through time. Although no single cause is apparent, such factors as competitive interactions, habitat loss and persistence of fishing pressure potentially explain these decreases. The rise in biomass was associated with a general increase in the average size, rather than increased biomass of commercial species, as the latter remained stable during the study period. Expansion of no-take areas, enforcement of fishing regulations, and surveillance in core zones, should be implemented to reverse the decline in particular species and to promote conservation of fish functional diversity in this MUMPA.",2,2020,10.7717/peerj.8885,WOS:000525081400005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These stressors have the potential to cause phase shifts to less productive ecosystems. A major challenge for ecologists is to identify ecosystem attributes that enhance resilience and can buffer systems from shifts to less desirable alternative states. In this study, we used the Northern Channel Islands, California, as a model kelp forest ecosystem that had been perturbed from the loss of an important sea star predator due to a sea star wasting disease. To determine the mechanisms that prevent phase shifts from productive kelp forests to less productive urchin barrens, we compared pre- and postdisease predator assemblages as predictors of purple urchin densities. We found that prior to the onset of the disease outbreak, the sunflower sea star exerted strong predation pressures and was able to suppress purple urchin populations effectively. After the disease outbreak, which functionally extirpated the sunflower star, we found that the ecosystem response-urchin and algal abundances-depended on the abundance and/or size of remaining predator species. Inside Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the large numbers and sizes of other urchin predators suppressed purple urchin populations resulting in kelp and understory algal growth. Outside of the MPAs, where these alternative urchin predators are fished, less abundant, and smaller, urchin populations grew dramatically in the absence of sunflower stars resulting in less kelp at these locations. Our results demonstrate that protected trophic redundancy inside MPAs creates a net of stability that could limit kelp forest ecosystem phase shifts to less desirable, alternative states when perturbed. This highlights the importance of harboring diversity and managing predator guilds.",8,2020,10.1002/ecy.2993,WOS:000516910100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Old and enforced MPAs showed the best-preserved limpet populations in the study area, and both variables (age and enforcement) best explained the observed variability among the MPAs studied.

Seagrass meadows are highly important ecosystems that are under constant pressure from human activities and climate impacts, with marked declines observed worldwide. Despite increasing efforts, monitoring of multispecific tropical seagrass meadows is scarce, particularly in low-income regions. Based on data from a monitoring programme in a marine protected area in Zanzibar (Tanzania), we assessed temporal changes in seagrass cover and species composition during a 10-year period in relation to local variability in environmental variables. We observed a strong, gradual decline in seagrass cover and changes in species composition, followed by a period of recovery. However, the timing and length of these temporal patterns varied in space (between transects). Multiple environmental variables-cloud cover, temperature, storm occurrence, sunspot activity, and tidal amplitude and height-influenced seagrass cover, although only to a minor extent, suggesting that the monitored seagrass meadow may be influenced by other unmeasured factors (e.g. water currents and sediment movement). Our results show that seagrass meadows can be highly dynamic at small (10-50 m) spatial scales, even in the absence of major local anthropogenic impacts.

They range in size and governance complexity from small communally managed MPAs, to massive MPAs on the High Seas managed by multinational organizations. As of August 2018, the Atlas of Marine Protection (MPAtlas.org) had catalogued information on over 12,000 Marine Protected Areas. We analyzed this global database to determine groups of MPAs whose characteristics best distinguished the diversity of MPA attributes globally, based upon our comprehensive sample. Groups were identified by pairing a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with a k-means cluster analysis using five variables; age of MPA, area of MPA, no-take area within MPA, latitude of the MPA's center, and Human Development Index (HDI) of the host country. Seven statistically distinct groups of MPAs emerged from this analysis and we describe and discuss the potential implications of their respective characteristics for MPA management. The analysis yields important insights into patterns and characteristics of MPAs around the world, including clusters of especially old MPAs (greater than 25 and 66 years of age), clusters distributed across nations with higher (HDI >= 0.827) or lower (HDI 0.827) levels of development, and majority no-take MPAs.

As a secondary outcome, future research may use the clusters identified in this paper to track variability in MPA performance indicators across clusters (e.g., biodiversity preservation/restoration, fish biomass) and thereby identify relationships between cluster and performance outcomes.

Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a 'Protection Paradox'. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate.",52,2019,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.05.005,WOS:000483908400033,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population.

Within such an approach, documenting the variation of plankton indicators and their covariation with climate is crucial as plankton represent the base of the food webs. With this perspective, we sought to document the variations in the emerging properties of the plankton to better understand the dynamics of the pelagic fishes, mammals and seabirds that inhabit the region.

We used data from several sampling transects carried out in the Iroise Sea from 2011 to 2015 to explore the seasonal and inter-annual variations of phytoplankton and mesozooplankton abundance, composition and size, as well as their covariation with abiotic variables, through multiple multivariate analyses. Overall, our observations are coherent with the plankton dynamics that have been observed in other regions of the North-East Atlantic. We found that both phytoplankton and zooplankton show consistent seasonal patterns in taxonomic composition and size structure but also display inter-annual variations. The spring bloom was associated with a higher contribution of large chain-forming diatoms compared to nanoflagellates, the latter dominating in fall and summer. Dinoflagellates show marked inter-annual variations in their relative contribution. The community composition of phytoplankton has a large impact on the mesozooplankton together with the distance to the coast. The size structure of the mesozooplankton community, examined through the ratio of small to large copepods, also displays marked seasonal patterns. We found that larger copepods (members of the Calanidae) are more abundant in spring than in summer and fall. We propose several hypotheses to explain the observed temporal patterns and we underline their importance for understanding the dynamics of other components of the food-web (such as sardines).

Since these activities often overlap spatially, they can interfere with each other. This paper aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability in the relative abundance of the Atlantic seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri), caught in the central coastal marine region of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where port activity takes place next to environmental protection areas. Commercial fishing data from a 6-year period (2009-2014) were used to perform this evaluation. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to the catch and effort data, and model coefficients were used to calculate the catch per unit effort (CPUE, kg/fishing day), which was standardized per square nautical mile and year. Semivariogram and kriging techniques were used to evaluate the existence of spatial dependence in the data and to estimate the standardized CPUE in unsampled areas. Isotropic spherical semivariogram models were fitted using the least squares method, and they showed a pattern of spatial dependence for all years. Variation in Atlantic seabob relative abundance within the vessel demarcation area of the Port of Santos was similar to that in the area used for dumping dredged material, although the latter was fished more frequently, thus creating larger catches. Therefore, commercial fishing data can be used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variation in the relative abundance of marine species in coastal regions. The results suggest that fishing and port activities interfere with one another in the region of the Port of Santos.",2,2019,10.1016/j.csr.2019.02.007,WOS:000464771500006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variation in the population density of giant clams in April and May 1999, 2010, and 2016 at seven reef sites around Mauritius: three marine protected areas (MPAs) and four non-MPAs, using three 250m(2) belt transects at each sites. Two species of giant clams were identified in the surveys as Tridacna maxima and Tridacna squamosa, and further classified into: juveniles (shell lengths, 0.1-79mm for T. maxima and 0.1-149mm for T. squamosa) and adults (shell lengths, 80mm for T. maxima and 150mm for T. squamosa). Our results showed a significant decline in the densities of both species from 1999 to 2016 at all seven sites.

Recruitment success is therefore indispensable for coral reef recovery after disturbances. Recruitment processes are governed by a variety of factors occurring at all spatial and temporal scales, from centimetres to hundreds of kilometres. In the present context of rising disturbances, it is thus of major importance to better understand the relative importance of different scales in this variation, and when possible, the factors associated with these scales. Multiscale spatio-temporal variability of scleractinian coral recruitment was investigated at two of the Mascarene Islands: Reunion and Rodrigues. Recruitment rates and taxonomic composition were examined during three consecutive six-month periods from regional to micro-local scales (i. e. from hundreds of kilometres to few centimetres) and between two protection levels (no-take zones and general protection zones). Very low recruitment rates were observed. Rodrigues displayed lower recruitment rates than Reunion. Recruit assemblage was dominated by Pocilloporidae (77.9%), followed by Acroporidae (9.9%) and Poritidae (5.2%). No protection effect was identified on coral recruitment, despite differences in recruitment rates among sites within islands. Recruits were patchily distributed within sites but no aggregative effect was detected, i. e. the preferentially colonised tiles were not spatially grouped. Recruits settled mainly on the sides of the tiles, especially at Rodrigues, which could be attributed to the high concentration of suspended matter. The variability of recruitment patterns at various spatial scales emphasises the importance of micro-to macro-local variations of the environment in the dynamics and maintenance of coral populations. High temporal variability was also detected, between seasons and years, which may be related to the early 2016 bleaching event at Rodrigues. The low recruitment rates and the absence of protection effect raise questions about the potential for recovery from disturbances of coral reefs in the Mascarene Islands.",2,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0214163,WOS:000462000400040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the nature and strength of those interactions varies with biogeographic context, emphasizing the need for region-specific investigations. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in predatory fish and seagrass communities across a Marine Protected Area (MPA) boundary in the Banana River Lagoon, Florida (USA), assessing trophic roles of intermediate consumers, and performing a large consumer exclusion experiment in the MPA. Large, predatory fishes were most abundant within the MPA, while some mid-sized fishes were more abundant outside it. Small, seagrass-resident fishes, epifaunal invertebrates, and macrophytes also differed across the MPA boundary, but varied more among individual sites and seasonally. We cannot conclusively attribute these patterns to MPA status because we lack data from prior to MPA establishment and lack study replication at the level of MPA. Nevertheless, other patterns among our data are consistent with hypothesized mechanisms of top-down control. E.g., inverse seasonal patterns in the abundance of organisms at adjacent trophic levels, coupled with stable C and N isotope and gut contents data, suggest top down control of crustacean grazers by seasonal recruitment of small fishes. Large-consumer exclosures in the MPA increased the abundance of mid-sized predatory and omnivorous fishes, but had few impacts on lower trophic levels. Results suggest that large-scale variation in large, predatory fish abundance in this system does not strongly affect seagrass-resident fish, invertebrate, and algal communities, which appear to be driven more by habitat structure and seasonal variation in small fish abundance.",0,2018,10.1016/j.jembe.2018.07.003,WOS:000442704000006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presented here are results from samples of the upper 25 m of the water column collected from September 2013 to November 2016. Additionally, following a localized mortality event likely associated with major continental flooding in summer 2016, water samples from up to similar to 250 m depth were collected in the broader FGBNMS area on a rapid response cruise to examine the seawater carbonate system. Both surface (< 5 m) total alkalinity (TA) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) vary over small ranges (2391 +/- 19 mu mol kg(-1) and 2060 +/- 19 mu mol kg(-1), respectively) for all times-series samples. Temperature and salinity both played an important role in controlling the surface water carbonate system dynamics, although temperature was the sole significant factor when there was no flooding.

Quantifying spatial and temporal variation in settlement is therefore important to fully understand population dynamics, inform fisheries management targets, and design effective spatial management strategies. Data on nearshore patterns of fish settlement are lacking for the northern California Current System (CCS), which is characterized by complex oceanographic currents and a seasonal, intermittent upwelling regime. Thus, to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of fish settlement in the northern CCS in relation to oceanographic conditions, we measured settlement of 5 fish taxa to 2 regions of the Oregon coast over 5 settlement seasons (late spring to early fall, 2012-2016). Temporal patterns of settlement reflected taxon-specific degrees of episodic settlement, with cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus exhibiting the most uniform settlement across each season, and splitnose Sebastes diploproa and redbanded S. babcocki rockfishes exhibiting the most episodic settlement. Fish settlement tended to be greater during short periods of downwelling (upwelling relaxation events) for all but the largest fish taxa. Within settlement season, variation in size-at-settlement tracked taxon-specific temporal patterns of arrival but was unrelated to water temperature. Differences in fish settlement between small marine reserves and nearby unprotected areas was region- and taxon-specific, highlighting the fact that size and habitat heterogeneity should be considered in the design of marine reserves. These findings provide a deeper understanding of settlement patterns across the mosaic of environmental variability in eastern boundary currents such as the CCS.",5,2018,10.3354/meps12616,WOS:000438415600010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding spatio-temporal variability in recruitment rates will help managers set realistic expectations for rates of population and community level change within individual MPAs. Here we ask whether seabird foraging rates can be used as a proxy for juvenile fish recruitment at spatial scales relevant to MPA management. We investigated the foraging rates of six piscivorous seabirds inside and outside of three island and four mainland MPAs in Southern California and compared these rates to estimates of juvenile fish density from kelp forest surveys conducted at the same sites during the same 2years (2012 and 2013). Juvenile fish communities at island and mainland sites were dominated by three families, Embiotocidae, Labridae and Pomacentridae, in both years. Additionally, there was an influx of young-of-the-year rockfishes (family Sebastidae) at most sites in 2013. Seabird and fish distributions were similar at the regional (approximately 15-30km) scale, but less similar at the site-specific scale. Site-specific differences reflected differences in the diet and foraging habits of individual seabird species. While fish surveys were specific to the kelp forest habitat, seabirds were sampling multiple habitats (i.e. multiple water depths over multiple bottom substrates) within a given site. Our results suggest that integrating seabird data with data on juvenile fish abundance can produce a more holistic index to proxy spatio-temporal variability in juvenile fish recruitment. In other words, seabird studies can provide additional information not captured by fish surveys and help resource managers better understand local patterns of fish recruitment at the community level. This will help resource managers establish realistic expectations for how quickly fish populations should change within individual MPAs.",2,2018,10.1111/maec.12485,WOS:000434150100004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypotheses about the importance of older female rockfish to population persistence have led to arguments that marine reserves are needed to ensure the sustainability of rockfish populations. However, the implications of these hypotheses for rockfish population dynamics are still unclear. We modeled two mechanisms by which reducing the proportion of older fish in a population has been hypothesized to influence sustainability, and explored whether these mechanisms influenced mean population dynamics and recruitment variability. We explored whether populations with these mechanisms could be managed more sustainably with a marine reserve in addition to a constant fishing mortality rate (F) than with a constant F alone. Both hypotheses can be seen as portfolio effects whereby risk of recruitment failure is spread over a portfolio of maternal ages. First, we modeled a spawning window effect whereby mothers of different ages spawned in different times or locations (windows) with local environmental conditions. Second, we modeled an offspring size effect whereby older mothers produced larger offspring than younger mothers, where length of a starvation period over which offspring could survive increased with maternal age. Recruitment variability resulting from both models was 55-65% lower than for models without maternal age-related portfolio effects in the absence of fishing and increased with increases in Fs for both models. An offspring size effect caused lower output reproductive rates such that the specified reproductive rate input as a model parameter was no longer the realized rate measured as the reproductive rate observed in model results; this quirk is not addressed in previous analyses of offspring size effects. We conducted a standardization such that offspring size effect and control models had the same observed reproductive rates. A comparison of long-term catch, the probability of falling below a biomass threshold, and recruitment variability over a range of exploitation rates for models with an age-related portfolio effect showed no benefit of a marine reserve implemented in addition to a constant F (as compared to a constant F alone) for populations with sedentary adults and sedentary or mobile larvae.",4,2017,10.1002/eap.1593,WOS:000412080200001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial and natural recruitment, mortality, population traits and juvenile growth were assessed in seasonal and annual surveys. In the Columbretes Islands, P. nobilis thrives in differing substrate types, from coarse sand to boulders, in Cymodocea nodosa meadows and among rhodoliths, and is always found sharing habitat with the less abundant sibling species P. rudis. In artificial collectors larval settlement occurred over a several months period, concentrating its peak in September and resulting from two separated spawning events. Recruitment in the collectors showed high inter-annual variability and was independent of depth, but positively correlated with seasonal water temperature increase in June. Natural recruitment of P. nobilis was low and showed little variability, evidencing the existence of intense post-settlement processes. Adult mortality was also low, thus leading to slow population dynamics and to the species' vulnerability to catastrophic events. Population size structure suggests the existence of a refuge size above 45 cm shell length. The fast growth during the first years of life would help shortening this vulnerability period. Altogether, essential information and tools for the species' conservation are provided, which will be critical in the current context of mass mortalities affecting P. nobilis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, patterns of recruitment are difficult to observe, and adults and juveniles may occupy distinct habitats. We examined patterns of adult black rockfish Sebastes melanops abundance with respect to habitat and spatiotemporal variability in recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) to determine how these variables influence population density in and around a rockfish conservation area (RCA). For most year classes, there was no relationship between the density of YOY and the density of 1 yr olds or the density of adults, and instead habitat variables such as topological complexity and the amount of rocky substrate predicted adult black rockfish abundance. For 1 year class of moderate abundance at the YOY stage but high abundance at the 1 yr old stage, a significant relationship between 1 yr olds and subsequent adults was observed. We surmise that over-winter survival of YOY fish may be an important determinant for year-class strength in black rockfish. Although a companion study found low recruitment of YOY inside the RCA, our data indicate that the density of many species of rockfish was higher inside the RCA.

The effects of maternal factors on intraspecific variations in larval quality of the Kuruma prawn (Marsupenaeus japonicus) were analyzed by determining the relationships between larval variability (body size and resistance to starvation) and maternal variability (maternal body size, spawning timing, and maternal body condition) in the laboratory from June to October 2015. In addition, temporal variations in parental body size of fished M. japonicus stock were examined by field investigation for ten years between 1996 and 2010 in Bungo-suido Channel, Japan. Body size and starvation resistance of hatched larvae varied by spawning timing (spawning date) and corresponded with seasonal availability of food for larvae in the field. Larger females produced larger larvae with stronger starvation resistance. The mean size of harvested female prawns has decreased significantly over time. Stocks of M. japonicus with reduced mean female size would show reductions in intraspecific variations in quality and quantity of larvae at the population level, resulting from observed maternal influences and size-dependent female reproductive potential. If fishing activity reduces body size, marine reserves can be used as a possible management option.",7,2017,10.1007/s00227-017-3118-9,WOS:000398579400009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to describe and evaluate phytoplankton dynamics in a pelagic Mediterranean MPA (The Pelagos International Marine Mammals Sanctuary) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea as a means to understand better the spatial and temporal distribution of basal ecosystem resources. Ocean colour data collected by orbital remote sensing (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor [SeaWiFS] data) were analysed to elucidate spatial and temporal variations in the concentration of chlorophyll-like pigments (chl). Mean chl images were generated for consecutive 10-day periods, to provide quasi-continuous coverage of the study area, combined with a Principal Component Analysis and analysis of a time series (1998-2004). The chl surface patterns traced seasonal upwelling events recurring annually, demonstrating the critical role of physical oceanography in sustaining the food web of the PelagosSanctuary. Phytoplankton blooms, however, differ in terms of peak timing, spatial distribution and chl concentration, due in part to the influence of broad-scale environmental factors that are beyond direct and regional control. Further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between the biomass of primary and secondary producers to understand better the implications of phytoplankton biomass distribution in space and time for charismatic and protected biota such as cetaceans.

We investigated the influence of environmental factors (depth, sea surface temperature (SST), salinity and distance to the nearest freshwater source) and coastal developments on THD density. Clear heterogeneity in density was found across the range of the THD, and there was significant spatial and temporal variation in mean densities. Density was not directly related to any environmental factors examined, which may be due to temporal variability and hydrological and oceanographic conditions that create, in effect, a continuous river delta along the central west coast of Taiwan rather than isolated, separate river estuaries. A high abundance of dolphins per unit of survey effort (DPUE) and mother-calf pairs per unit of survey effort (MCPUE) were found in waters adjacent to major coastal developments in which shallow waters had been filled to create new land (reclamation areas), but neither distance to, reclamation area nor distance to the nearest river were found to be significant predictors of density. Most reclamation projects in THD habitat are situated near the mouths of major rivers or result in the creation of artificial confluences of smaller rivers, streams and other freshwater outlets, such as waste outflows. Thus, dolphins appear to use these areas in the absence of high quality natural habitat that has been lost to large-scale coastal reclamation throughout their range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the eradication of lionfish is no longer considered possible, population suppression to site-specific densities can allow native fish populations to recover. Understanding the diet of lionfish in invaded areas is critical to understanding local impacts they pose to coral reef communities. This study explored the diet of lionfish in the northern end of the Belize Barrier Reef and tested whether biological variables (size, sex or reproductive stage) affect the diversity and/or abundance of prey species consumed. Between 2011 and 2014, 1023 lionfish were dissected and their gut contents analysed in the Bacalar Chico Marine Reserve. Gut contents analyses revealed that large sized lionfish consumed the highest abundance of prey (Mean (M)= 3.27 prey items) compared to small (M= 1.74 prey items) and medium (M= 3.15 prey items) lionfish, and that reproductive females consumed a higher abundance of prey (M= 3.66) compared to non-reproductive females of the same size (M= 2.85). As we found that medium and large lionfish are generalist predators and feed on a diverse assemblage of prey items, the effects of lionfish on the biomass of any one species may be reduced. This may enable individual prey species to have relatively stable abundances, although this hypothesis bears further testing. If management efforts are focused on improving a site-specific population of an individual prey species, such as an endemic or threatened fish, it is important to include removal efforts of small lionfish, particularly if they inhabit the same niche habitat. However, we recommend that existing lionfish focused cull dives continue using non-size discriminatory methods in order to account for site-specific, ecologically and commercially important prey items and to deter the likelihood of a successful invasion.",6,2017,10.3391/mbi.2017.8.1.06,WOS:000405239500006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are efficient tools for habitat recovery and ideal environments for evaluating changes on the trophic structure resulting from human activities. The present work targeted fish assemblages from two no-take MPAs from the northern half of South Alentejo and Costa Vicentina Marine Park, established in 2011. Previous works reported positive effects on local fish assemblages after no-take MPA designation, and it is therefore important to further study its impact on local fish assemblages, especially concerning trophic interactions. Local fish assemblages were sampled (summer 2011, winter 2012, summer 2013 and winter 2013) using trammel nets. Diets were characterized and digestive tract contents of the 10 most abundant fish species were compared between the no take MPAs (treatment) and adjacent areas (controls), and changes evaluated as a function of time since protection. Results revealed significant differences between the diets of fish from protected and non protected areas, with crabs being the preferential prey in both protected and control areas but being more ingested outside the no-take areas. However, these differences were evident since the beginning of the study. Fish assemblages from the northern area presented significantly larger niche breadth and. significantly increasing with time. This way, the main effects of no-take MPA implementation were directly visible on the niche breadth but did not directly impact the diet composition of the sampled fish assemblages, contributing however to reinforce the already naturally existent differences. This work provides important information regarding the effect of changes in the fish assemblage caused by MPA designation on the trophic ecology of fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, we used generalized linear models to analyse fish egg and larval abundance in relation to environmental variables. Results showed that fish eggs and larvae exhibit high variability among months, years and sampling stations in the time series.

In 1991, Chile established a national coastal TURF policy that gave legal authority to assign exclusive access rights to artisanal fisher organizations. In 2014, there were several hundred TURFs decreed to fisher organizations in different biophysical and socioeconomic settings. To date, research assessing TURF implementation has generally been based on a few case studies and have had mixed results. Here, we present results from a survey of 535 fishers from 55 different artisanal fisher organizations. The survey consisted of three open-ended questions that explore users' perceptions of the main problems, benefits, and improvements concerning assigned TURFs. We also sampled 55 presidents of artisanal fisher organizations to explore how they perceived the accomplishments of TURFs. Main key problems, as perceived by fishers, include increased costs associated with surveillance and poaching, and the variability and sometimes lack of financial returns. Despite strong price drops in exported species, TURFs have provided incentives for innovation and stewardship, and fishers are generally unwilling to relinquish them. In fact, fishers define TURF benefits in multiple dimensions, which include conservation/ ecological and territorial empowerment. Fisher presidents stress that although expectations of economic benefits have not been fully realized, territorial empowerment is a critical benefit. Through the analysis of fishers' perceptions on solutions to TURFs' problems, we highlight the development of stocking activities, combining TURFs with marine reserves, food traceability, and what we call BIO+ seafood-products that have associated biodiversity benefits.",51,2017,10.5343/bms.2015.1082,WOS:000393731900004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness and integrity of PA are being challenged and questioned worldwide and this situation is not different in Brazil. Poorly managed PA are more vulnerable to habitat loss, poaching and other threats. Alarmingly, studies have shown that just a fraction of the current PA can be considered effectively managed. Facing such scenario, studies on the effectiveness of the management of PA and especially marine PA (MPA)- become essential to enhance the role these areas play in biodiversity conservation, as well as provide useful tools for managers and decision-makers. Using the Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology, we evaluated the management effectiveness of the largest MPA in Brazil, the Environmental Protected Area Costa dos Corals (APACC, IUCN category V). In a rare opportunity in the context of Brazil's PA system, we were able to access the management effectiveness of APACC over a 15-year period, tracking progresses, identifying strengthens and weaknesses experienced. The overall management effectiveness of APACC has improved over the last 15 years. Although there were variations, five out of 14 indicators analyzed presented improvements while nine remained stable over the years. Finance was the module that contributed the most for the general improvement of APACC. Contrary to many other PA worldwide, which face budget restrictions, APACC's financial situation is currently stable and such stability may have had a positive effect on other management modules, like Infrastructure and Outputs. Research, Monitoring and Evaluation was among modules with slower progress, which is a contradiction considering APACC is amongst the Brazilian MPA with more research. The feedback from researchers is considered poor and most of the research conducted considered not useful for management purposes. Tourism has the highest increase in criticality, being not only the biggest pressure, but also the main threat. Considering that there were improvements in other areas, increasing APACC's limited staff should be a priority for the coming years. RAPPAM proved to be a quick and easy-to-apply methodology, making it effective for temporal analysis on the management of MPA. However, caution is necessary when analyzing some of RAPPAM results. Frequent changes in the management staff, poor records of the management process and the activities adopted, and incomplete transference of information between staff members inevitably compromises the answers and the overall accuracy. RAPPAM needs in loco validation of the answers and this could be a time consuming process for large PA. For better results, RAPPAM could and should be applied together with other evaluation methods.

A significant challenge of reef fish monitoring is to determine the influence of temporal factors on fish counts. Fish assemblages are dynamic and changes in activity patterns throughout the day can influence the results of surveys. While many monitoring programs account for the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on fish assemblages the effects of short-term temporal variation are less well known. In the present study, we analysed data from 197 video drops inside and outside New Caledonian MPAs and examined temporal variations in various metrics commonly used to monitor marine reserves. In addition to describing short-term temporal patterns related to time of day, tide height and state, and lunar cycle; we also examined the influence of these temporal factors on the size and direction of any MPA effects detected. Fewer Serranidae were observed at full moon than the rest of the lunar cycle and there were negative correlations between Chaetodontidae and Acanthuridae abundance and tide height. We did not find any consistent effects of time of day. Generally, variation in short term temporal factors did not affect the direction MPA effects detected but did affect the size of the effects for some metrics. For both small fish abundance and species richness, bigger differences between protected and unprotected sites were detected at high tide than low tide. These results highlight how survey results can vary with timing of sampling and have implications for developing optimal monitoring programs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Therefore, regional andlor local decision makers do not implement the necessary measures to reduce fluvial sediment fluxes on coral reefs.The Magdalena River, the main contributor of continental fluxes into the Caribbean Sea, delivers water and sediment fluxes into the Rosario Islands National Park, an important marine protected area in the southwestern Caribbean. Until now, there is no scientific consensus on the presence of sediment fluxes from the Magdalena River in the coral reefs of the Rosario Islands. Our hypothesis is that high sediment and freshwater inputs from the Magdalena have been present at higher acute levels during the last decade than previously thought, and that these runoff pulses are not flashy. We use in-situ calibrated MODIS satellite images to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the distribution of suspended sediment over the coral reefs. Furthermore, geochemical data are analyzed to detect associated sedimentation rates and pollutant dispersion into the coastal zone. Results confirm that turbidity levels have been much higher than previous values presented by national environmental authorities on coral reefs off Colombia over the last decade. During the 2003-2013 -period most of the Total Suspended Sediments (TSS) values witnessed in the sampled regions were above 10 mg/I, a threshold value of turbidity for healthy coral reef waters. TSS concentrations throughout the analyzed time were up to 623 mg,I. Plume pulses were more pronounced during wet seasons of La Nina events in 2002-2003, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010. Reconstructed time series of MODIS TSS indicates that coral reef waters were exposed to river plumes between 19.6 and 47.3% of the entire period of analysis (2000-2013), Further analyses of time series of water discharge and sediment load into the coastal zone during the last two decades show temporal increases in water discharge and sediment load of 2n and 48%, respectively. 21 Pb dating results from two cores indicate sedimentation rates of -0.75 cm/y of continentally exported clastic muddy sediments that are being deposited on the carbonatic shelf. The cores contain sediments with heavy metals and their concentrations are frequently above the ecologically accepted standards. Overall, the last decade has witnessed stronger magnitudes in fluvial fluxes to the coastal region, which probably coincide with associated declines in healthy coral cover and water quality. Our results emphasize the importance of local stressors, such as runoff and dispersion of turbid plumes, as opposed to ocean warming, disease and hurricanes, which have played a larger role on other coral reefs in the Caribbean. Coral reef management across the southwestern Caribbean, a coastal region influenced by continental fluxes of numerous rivers flowing from the Andes, may only be effective when land and marine -based stressors are simultaneously mitigated.

Here we modeled fish biomass estimates across all reefs of the western Indian Ocean using key variables that predicted the empirical data collected from 337 sites. These variables were used to create biomass and recovery time maps to prioritize spatially explicit conservation actions. The resultant fish biomass map showed high variability ranging from similar to 15 to 2900 kg/ha, primarily driven by human populations, distance to markets, and fisheries management restrictions. Lastly, we assembled data based on the age of fisheries closures and showed that biomass takes similar to 25 years to recover to typical equilibrium values of similar to 1200 kg/ha. The recovery times to biomass levels for sustainable fishing yields, maximum diversity, and ecosystem stability or conservation targets once fishing is suspended was modeled to estimate temporal costs of restrictions. The mean time to recovery for the whole region to the conservation target was 8.1(+/-3SD) years, while recovery to sustainable fishing thresholds was between 0.5 and 4 years, but with high spatial variation. Recovery prioritization scenario models included one where local governance prioritized recovery of degraded reefs and two that prioritized minimizing recovery time, where countries either operated independently or collaborated.

In the Mediterranean Sea, Cystoseira spp. and Sargassum spp. have been shown to be locally extinct or locally functionally extinct, i.e. no longer forest forming, even in some Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).The patterns of change in the diversity and abundance of Fucales taxa within the Port-Cros Archipelago (Port-Cros National Park; PCNP) was studied by comparison of recent data (2005 to 2007) with previous data in order to measure the effects of protection since the creation of the park in 1963. Three taxa were reported before 1963, 10 between 1963 and 2005 and 17 between 2005 and 2007. Considering the biology of the species listed and the distance from the coast of the Port-Cros Archipelago, it is unlikely that this increase in species richness has resulted from colonisation events through the implementation and enforcement of effective protection of the area but is rather due to an increase in sampling effort. In contrast to other Mediterranean areas, the populations of Fucales are still highly diversified and stable. Only one species, C. brachycarpa var. brachycarpa, has declined in the 1-10-m depth zone in relation to the proliferation of herbivorous species, possibly enhanced by the PNPC conservation strategy. The overall good conservation of Fucales populations of the PCNP is probably the result of the absence of habitat destruction, high seawater quality and the regulation of human activities (fishing, tourism, diving).",28,2016,10.7872/crya/v37.iss1.2016.61,WOS:000377603900006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sampling was spatially stratified across the swash and dry sand habitats on each of two commercially fished and two non-fished beaches, and temporally stratified across three six-week blocks: before, early and late harvesting. Small-scale spatio-temporal variability in the densities and sizes of clams was prevalent across both habitats and the components of variation were generally greatest at the lowest levels examined. Despite this, differences in the densities and sizes of clams among individual beaches were evident, but there were few significant differences across the commercially fished versus non-fished beaches from before to during harvesting. There was no evidence of reduced densities or truncated size compositions of clams on fished compared to non-fished beaches, contrasting reports of some other organisms in protected areas. This was probably due to a combination of factors, including the current levels of commercial harvests, the movements and other local-scale responses of clams to ecological processes acting independently across individual beaches. The results identify the difficulties in detecting fishing-related impacts against inherent levels of variability in clam populations.

From 2012 to 2015, we performed a census and an ecological study for this gastropod mollusc in the Zembra Archipelago National Park in Tunisia, where a large population still remains. In 1986, a total of 20,000 individuals were estimated, with 0.7 ind/m(2), 4.4 cm adult mean size and low recruitment rate. In 2009, the estimated population reached 38,559 individuals with 2.65 ind/m(2), 5.42 cm adult mean size and high recruitment rate. During the present work, 43,790 individuals were estimated in 2012, 27,359 in 2013, 33,170 in 2014 and 40,404 in 2015, with an average density ranging from 0.1 to 8.5 individuals per square metre, but reaching as many as 25 ind/m(2) on some shores. This makes the archipelago one of the most important Mediterranean 'hot spots' for P. ferruginea, as it has a large and well-conserved population of this species. Variability of the population size is influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors, but is principally impacted by poaching of the species. The poachers target individuals larger than 6 cm in length, and the sex ratio study has shown that over 70% of individuals become females at that size. In addition, high recruitment rates were recorded in 2012 and 2013, but these decreased in 2014 and 2015, although population numbers show the opposite pattern. Moreover, growth rate is low and P. ferruginea may need many years to reach a large adult size. The loss of reproductive potential due to poaching inevitably causes a significant imbalance in the limpet population. Our results indicate the importance of the National Park for P. ferruginea and underline the need for this species to be protected and monitored over a long period to provide the most appropriate management measures.",7,2016,10.1080/17451000.2016.1213396,WOS:000389127300003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In January 2002, beach driving was banned in South Africa, thereby reducing angler access to large areas of the coastline, particularly in less-developed areas. In November 2001 a project had been established in the St Lucia Marine Reserve, on the east coast of South Africa, to compare surf-zone fish populations inside a no-take sanctuary zone with those in an adjacent exploited area. Subsequent to the ban, the aim of the project was adapted such that surf-zone fish populations were monitored for potential recovery in what had been the exploited area, located to the north of Cape Vidal, which anglers could no longer access easily, because of the prohibition on beach driving. Standardised research fishing was conducted at two sites in the previously exploited area and two sites in the no-take sanctuary. Conventional stock-status indicators showed evidence of recovery in the four most common species caught in the previously exploited area, in terms of both abundance and biomass. Generalised additive mixed models were used to account for the influence of targeting specific species; however, subtle differences in habitat between the sampling sites, improved angling skill over time, variability in recruitment, and differential species-specific responses complicated interpretation of results.

Here, we test whether spatial management with marine reserves can increase ecological resilience compared to non-spatial (conventional) management using a dynamic model of a simplified fish community with structured predation and competition that causes alternative stable states. Relative to non-spatial management, reserves increase the resilience of the desired (predator-dominated) equilibrium state in both stochastic and deterministic environments, especially under intensive fishing. As a result, spatial management also increases the feasibility of restoring degraded (competitor-dominated) systems, particularly if combined with culling of competitors or stock enhancement of adult predators.",27,2015,10.1111/ele.12524,WOS:000364519000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual management interventions can influence this balance by altering some, but not all of these potential drivers. For example, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs can increase herbivorous fish abundance, thereby decreasing macroalgal coverage, but have limited influence on water quality and other vagile drivers. We compared the relative influence of seven abiotic water quality variables to that of MPA status on macroalgal coverage in 14 sites (5 of which are within no-take MPAs) over four consecutive seasons (summer through to spring) within the marginal coral reef habitats of Moreton Bay, Australia. Algal cover was quantified by taking 100 photo quadrats per site per sampling with the relative importance of our eight factors determined statistically by generalised additive models. Overall, temporal variations in total macroalgal cover and four out of five important macroalgal genera correlated with factors other than marine protection, especially water temperature, salinity, water clarity (Secchi disc) and nutrient concentration (nitrogen and phosphorus). However, seasonal variations in cover of individual macroalgal genera did not follow strong temporal trends and were not consistent with total macroalgal cover, meaning that different factors were significant for different algal genera. Consequently, we advocate for caution in determining the influence of impact gradients by exclusively measuring total macroalgal cover.

The magnitude and timing of changes in these response variables, however, vary greatly and depend upon the taxonomic groups protected, size and type of reserve, oceanographic regime, and time since the reserve was implemented. We conducted collaborative, fishery-independent surveys of fishes for seven years in and near newly created marine protected areas (MPAs) in central California, USA. Results showed that initially most MPAs contained more and larger fishes than associated reference sites, likely due to differences in habitat quality. The differences between MPAs and reference sites did not greatly change over the seven years of our study, indicating that reserve benefits will be slow to accumulate in California's temperate eastern boundary current. Fishes in an older reserve that has been closed to fishing since 1973, however, were significantly more abundant and larger than those in associated reference sites. This indicates that reserve benefits are likely to accrue in the California Current ecosystem, but that 20 years or more may be needed to detect significant changes in response variables that are due to MPA implementation. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of fish recruitment patterns, long-term monitoring is needed to identify positive responses of fishes to protection in the diverse set of habitats in a dynamic eastern boundary current. Qualitative estimates of response variables, such as would be obtained from an expert opinion process, are unlikely to provide an accurate description of MPA performance.

We then applied our ecological effectiveness estimates - the added benefit of marine protection over and above conventional fisheries management - to a gap analysis of existing MPAs, and MPAs proposed by four indigenous groups on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, we assessed representation, size, spacing, and governance considerations against MPA design criteria outlined in the literature. We found significant differences in response ratios for IUCN Categories IV and VI MPAs compared to no-take reserves and areas open to fishing, although variability in responses was high. By rescaling the predicted ecological effectiveness ratios (including confidence estimates), we found that, compared to no-take reserves (biodiversity conservation effectiveness 100%) and open fishing areas (0% additional biodiversity contribution over and above conventional fisheries management), IUCN Category IV had a predicted effectiveness score of 60%, ranging between 34% and 89% (95% lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively), and IUCN Category VI had a predicted effectiveness score of 24% (ranging between -12% and 72% for the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively). We found that the existing MPAs did poorly when compared against most MPA design criteria, whereas the proposed MPA network achieved many of the best practices identified in the literature, and could achieve all if some additional sites were added.

The aim of this study was to assess the observed changes in the fish population structure in the years following a fishing ban. The experiment took place in the Bamboung bolong, a small bay in the Sine Saloum estuary in Senegal, West Africa. The protection of this zone was undertaken with local fishermen support, and a formal MPA was created in 2004. The survey of the fish assemblages was initiated in 2003, the year before the fishing ban, and went on until 2007, with 12 sampling sites being monitored three times per year.In this paper, we describe and analyze the evolution of the fish assemblage during this five years' experimental period. Some changes have been highlighted on which the effect of the fishing ban was shown. After the fishing ban, an increase of total biomass and of maximal fish length has been registered. In the same time, the number of species has increased and the percentage of large and/or iconic species targeted by fishing has also increased. The community structure has been modified, with more small fish, more big fish (new large species and more large individuals in the original species) and fewer medium sized fish. The contribution of marine affinity species has increased in depend of the estuarine part of the assemblage. Finally, the trophic structure has been modified with an overall increase of the mean trophic level, resulting from an increase of the percentage of generalist or piscivorous predators and a sharp decrease of herbivorous and detritivorous low trophic level species. Marine predators which numbers and size were reduced by fisheries are again important components of the system. We argue that despite the intrinsic variability of the tropical estuarine environments, the introduction of a total ban on fishing in such estuarine zones can substantially improve the health status of the fish assemblage.

Although traditional population-genetic tools can be applied to infer movement of larvae on an evolutionary timescale, large effective population sizes and high rates of gene flow present serious challenges to documenting dispersal patterns over shorter, ecologically relevant, timescales. Here, we address these challenges by combining direct parentage analysis and indirect genetic analyses over a 4-year period to document spatial and temporal patterns of larval dispersal in a common coral-reef fish: the bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus). At four island locations surrounding Exuma Sound, Bahamas, including a long-established marine reserve, we collected 3278 individuals and genotyped them at 10 microsatellite loci. Using Bayesian parentage analysis, we identified eight parent-offspring pairs, thereby directly documenting dispersal distances ranging from 0 km (i.e., self-recruitment) to 129 km (i.e., larval connectivity). Despite documenting substantial dispersal and gene flow between islands, we observed more self-recruitment events than expected if the larvae were drawn from a common, well-mixed pool (i.e., a completely open population). Additionally, we detected both spatial and temporal variation in signatures of sweepstakes and Wahlund effects. The high variance in reproductive success (i.e., 'sweepstakes') we observed may be influenced by seasonal mesoscale gyres present in the Exuma Sound, which play a prominent role in shaping local oceanographic patterns.

We used a biophysical model to simulate dispersal of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, larvae and connectivity among a network of 10 no-take reserves in a shallow, wind-driven estuary to assess the relative importance of spawning location, spawning date, larval behavior, larval mortality, and adult reproductive output to predicted dispersal and connectivity patterns. The location (i.e., natal reserve) and date of spawning relative to physical processes, particularly frequency of wind reversals, were the dominant drivers of dispersal and connectivity patterns. To a lesser extent, larval behavior (i.e., 3D vertical advection and ontogenetic depth regulation) and mortality modified dispersal and connectivity, whereas spatiotemporal variability in adult reproductive output was of minimal importance. Over a 21-day larval duration, mean dispersal distance of passive surface particles ranged from 5 to 40km. Reserves were too small (1km2) relative to mean dispersal distances to promote extensive local retention (median 2%) and spaced too far apart (typically similar to 50km) to promote extensive inter-reserve connectivity (median 2%). Limited connectivity and local retention may preclude the network from being self-sustainable, thereby limiting its long-term conservation and management benefits. In reserve systems characterized by limited connectivity, management efforts should focus on increasing connectivity by increasing the number or size of reserves to realize the benefits of improved adult demographics within reserves.",41,2014,10.1111/fog.12067,WOS:000337601100004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Echinoid community structure is affected by the habitat structural and environmental conditions; while at the same time, echinoids may also act as 'reef engineers', able to alter marine environments on a wide geographic scale. In particular, echinoids play a major role in bioerosion and herbivory on coral reefs. Through feeding, echinoids reduce algal cover, enabling settlement and coral growth. However, at the same time, they also remove large parts of the reef hard substrata, gradually leading to reef degradation. Here, we compared coral and macroalgal abundance, echinoid community structure and species-specific rates of echinoid herbivory and bioerosion on reefs subjected to different intensities of oceanic exposure. Spatio-temporal variations in coral and macroalgal cover were monitored, and populations of the four most abundant echinoid species on the coral reefs of Zanzibar - Diadema setosum (Leske), Diadema savignyi (Michelin), Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville) and Echinothrix diadema (Linnaeus) - were compared between the Island's eastern exposed reefs and western sheltered ones. To account for the effect of management in the context of reef exposure, we included marine protected areas (MPAs) of both types of reef categories (i.e. sheltered and exposed) in our comparison. Coral and macroalgal cover presented a conspicuous contrasting pattern across exposed and sheltered sites. While coral dominance and lack of macroalgae were prominent on sheltered reefs, an opposite trend of low coral cover and moderate-high macroalgal cover were found on exposed reefs. Bioerosion was also significantly higher on exposed reefs than on sheltered ones (4.2-13 and 12-3.9 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), respectively). The highest rates, recorded on Pongwe, with almost 7 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), are among the highest echinoid bioerosion rates known to date. Management had a substantial effect on habitat and echinoid community structure, as coral cover was significantly higher, macroalgal cover lower, and echinoid densities generally reduced on MPAs regardless of exposure intensity. Our findings suggest that exposed reefs are susceptible to markedly higher degrees of echinoid bioerosion; however, adequate management measures can significantly reduce these rates, consequently altering the reefs trajectory for degradation.

Both spatial and temporal impacts these species have on the structure and dynamics of the subtidal community are poorly understood. In one of the oldest MEABRs of Chile we evaluated spatial and temporal effects of controlled extraction of commercial species on subtidal macro invertebrate's diversity. Our results indicate that in a spatial scale MEABRs showed increased species richness, and important temporal changes in diversity and species composition from bivalves, ascidians and gastropods to cnidarians, sponges and bryozoans. We discuss possible mechanisms associated with the combined effects of fishery management and predation by key species on temporal composition variation in the subtidal macro invertebrate assemblage in this regulated area.

Chl. a showed a steep increasing gradient from outer to the inner regions of the PBB. The number of zooplankton taxa recorded at both areas was quite similar, but marked differences were noticed in their relative contribution to the total abundance. Eventhough the Copepoda dominated at both the areas, the non-copepod taxa differed significantly between the regions. Dominance of carnivores such as siphonophores and chaetognaths were noticed at PBB, while filter feeders such as appendicularians and decapod larvae were more abundant at MPA.

These practices focus on the selective harvest of sporophytes to allow the maintenance of a reproductive stock, facilitating recruitment and minimizing grazing of benthic herbivores. To improve coverage and accessibility, enforcement of administration measures along the northern coast of Chile requires ecological indicators to monitor the sustainability of Lessonia kelps. Over 2 years, density, biomass, recruitment, and size structure of Lessonia were sampled seasonally in coastal areas with different regimens of harvesting administration as follows: (1) Management Areas for Exploitation of Benthic Resources (MAEBR), (2) Open Access Areas (OAA), and (3) Marine Protected Areas without human intervention. The use of demographic parameters as ecological indicators allows discrimination between kelp beds where good harvesting practices have been applied by users (MAEBR), and areas where management recommendations have not been put in practice (OAA). The ecological indicators reinforced the concept of co-management in MAEBR as a viable harvesting administration system along the Chilean coast, and indicated a high-harvesting pressure in OAA. Moreover, together with other harvesting parameters, they could be useful to justify the application of other administration strategies, such as quotas or bans.",30,2014,10.1007/s10811-013-0167-4,WO+A92:R92S:000334498200012,field,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In non-MPAs, biomass of herbivorous fishes was 70-80% lower, macroalgal cover 4-9 fold higher, macroalgal-coral contacts 5-15 fold more frequent and 23-67 fold more extensive (measured as % of colony margin contacted by macroalgae), and coral cover 51-68% lower than in MPAs.

Montipora digitata experienced intermediate damage. Extent of damage from macroalgal contact was independent of coral colony size for each of the 10 macroalgal-coral pairings we established.

Using a large-scale synthesis of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, we examine variability in abundance and biomass of herbivorous reef fishes and explore evidence for fishing impacts globally and within regions. We show that biomass is more than twice as high in locations not accessible to fisheries relative to fisheries-accessible locations. Although there are large biogeographic differences in total biomass, the effects of fishing are consistent in nearly all regions. We also show that exposure to fishing alters the structure of the herbivore community by disproportionately reducing biomass of large-bodied functional groups (scraper/excavators, browsers, grazer/detritivores), while increasing biomass and abundance of territorial algal-farming damselfishes (Pomacentridae). The browser functional group that consumes macroalgae and can help to prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts appears to be most susceptible to fishing. This fishing down the herbivore guild probably alters the effectiveness of these fishes in regulating algal abundance on reefs.

There were few reserve effects on mean or mean maximum size. The results indicate a gradient of exploitation among species and sites. One non-reserve site was more heavily exploited than the other, while one reserve experienced more poaching than the other.

We report spatial and temporal variability patterns of amphipod assemblages in 4 different protection levels and discuss potential confounding effects, such as habitat features. The structure of amphipod assemblages based on density data was patchy at all spatial scales investigated, but differed markedly among protection levels.

Furthermore, P. oceanica meadow features (shoot density, leaf and epiphyte biomasses, coefficient A and litter biomass) accounted for only a low proportion of the total variability. We consequently infer that the observed patchiness is likely to occur for multiple and interconnected reasons, ranging from the ecological and behavioural traits of amphipod species to protection-dependent processes (e. g. fish predation).

Surveys were replicated at many levels, including areas inside and outside of marine reserves at 3 locations in 2 seasons, over a period of up to 14 yr, in an unbalanced design. The Bayesian modelling approach allowed the use of some familiar aspects of ANOVA, including mixed models of fixed and random effects, hierarchically nested structures, and variance decomposition, while allowing for overdispersion and excess zeros in the counts. Model selection and estimates of variance components revealed that protection by marine reserves was by far the strongest measured source of variation for relative densities of legal-sized snapper. The size of the effect varied across years among the 3 reserves, with relative densities between 7 and 20 times greater in reserves than in nearby areas. Other than the reserve effect, the temporal factors of season and year were generally more important than the spatial factors at explaining variation in counts. In particular, overall relative densities were similar to 2 to 3 times greater in autumn than in spring for legal-sized snapper, although the seasonal effect was also variable among locations and years.

To help address this, networks of no take marine reserves are being promoted as a means of conserving biodiversity and managing coastal resources. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of individual marine reserves and metaanalyses have shown that marine reserves provide positive outcomes for marine conservation. Few studies, however, have examined the effects of marine reserves with different levels of protection or examined shallow subtidal areas (1-3 m depth). Here, we examine changes within a network of no take marine reserves relative to partially protected take areas after 5 years of operation. We also examine similar open areas outside the boundaries of the marine reserve network. We show that some targeted species including red morwong (Cheilodactylus fuscus) and abalone (Haliotis rubra) were more abundant in marine reserves than elsewhere. Fish assemblages inside the marine reserve network differed from those outside the boundaries of the reserve network. This result was driven by habitat differences; abundant, schooling species of fish were more commonly encountered outside the marine reserve where urchin barrens dominated. The combination of large spatio-temporal variation in reef assemblages and variable effects of early reserve protection in shallow subtidal habitats made it challenging to detect other changes among zones. Careful consideration of variation in the design and analysis of shallow subtidal reef monitoring is necessary to ensure such programs can best inform adaptive management processes.

The results showed differences between warm (summer and autumn) and cold (winter and spring) seasons, with the autumn clearly standing out. In general, the values of the metrics density of juveniles, density of invertebrate feeders and density of omnivores increased in warm seasons, which can be attributed to differences in recruitment patterns, spawning migrations and feeding activity among seasons. The density of generalist/opportunistic individuals was sensitive to the effect of fishing, with higher values at zones with the lowest level of protection, while the density of individuals with high commercial value only responded to fishing in the autumn, due to a cumulative result of both juveniles and adults abundances during this season. Overall, this study showed that seasonal variability affects structural and functional features of the fish assemblage and that might influence the detection of changes as a result of anthropogenic pressures. The choice of a specific season, during warm sea conditions after the spawning period (July-October), seems to be more adequate to assess changes on rocky-reef fish assemblages.

MPAs directly impact, and are impacted by, the fishing industry and knowing fishers' attitudes towards MPAs is critical for their success. In general, fishing activity is permitted within the boundaries of MPAs in Scotland but with different levels of restrictions, thus impacting differently on different sectors of the fishing industry. The present study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the attitudes towards closed areas of Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears. The results show that different gear-users expressed significantly different opinions about closed areas as management tools, their ability to protect stocks and decrease conflicts. Furthermore, a logistic model revealed that, besides the gear-type fishers operate, other characteristics (educational level, location and perceptions of compliance) influence fishers' opinions about closed areas. Fishers are not a homogeneous collective and the difference in perceptions about closed areas among Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears has important implications for management. Regarding the important role MPAs will play in the long-term conservation and fisheries management plans in Europe, understanding the variability in fishers' attitudes within the same, and between different, groups will facilitate successful planning and management of MPAs.

Density, size (test diam), and biomass of sea urchin were assessed in October 2004 (just before the fishing season) and in May 2005 (immediately after the fishing season) at two locations where intense P. lividus harvest occurs and at two controls within an adjacent Marine Protected Area (MPA) where P. lividus harvest is prohibited. Density, size, and average biomass of P. lividus were significantly higher at the protected areas than at the exploited ones. In particular, large-sized specimens (test diam >5 cm) were notably less abundant at the fished locations; however, very similar results were detected for both the periods examined (i.e., before and after the fishing season), suggesting that effects of pressing activity of harvest through the past years may have produced effects much more evident than those attributable to the single fishing season.

From 2006 to 2008, average oyster recruitment and total density increased 15- and fivefold, respectively. The unprecedentedly high oyster densities in certain reserves (up to 6,500/m(2) at the end of the study) modified demographic rates such that further density increases were regulated by density-dependent survival. Oyster demographic rates varied significantly among reserves at relatively small spatial scales (20 km). Certain reserves were the strong recruiters, others the fast growers, and yet others the high survivors. Cohort dynamics altered the demographic rank order such that the demographically best reserves varied intra- and interannually. From a management perspective, the prevalence of density-dependent survival suggests that the oysters in this system are habitat rather than recruitment limited, which may minimize the utility of stock enhancement programs. Addition of habitat (i.e., artificial reefs) should focus on reserves characterized by high recruitment but density-dependent growth and survival.

In this study, we measured mean effects of reserves and the influence of distance from reserve borders on the number and size of legal (>= 82.5 mm carapace length [CL]) California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus trapped at sites across a reserve network at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, California, USA. Additionally, we controlled for habitat variability across sites (1) by measuring relative abundance of sublegal adult lobsters (i.e. those not removed through fishing) and (2) through visual SCUBA surveys on which we quantified fine-scale habitat features. Traps placed in reserves yielded more (4.81 trap(-1)) and larger (7.03 mm CL) legal-sized lobsters than traps placed outside. Multiple linear regression revealed that 2.43 more legal lobsters per trap were captured for every 1 km moved from borders towards reserve centers. Additionally, lobsters tagged and released immediately inside reserve borders were recaptured in areas open to fishing at a higher rate than lobsters tagged and released farther inside reserves. These results suggest that abundance gradients inside reserve borders were caused by net emigration of lobsters (spillover). Sub legal lobsters were more abundant inside reserves and nearer to reserve centers, but these increases were much smaller in magnitude than for legal-sized lobsters. Our results indicate that the differences we observed for legal-sized lobsters were driven primarily by reserve effects but were partially influenced by habitat heterogeneity.",23,2012,10.3354/meps09592,WOS:000303908000010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a high spatial variability in the structure and dynamics of C. zosteroides populations at small geographical scales, suggesting that environmental factors acting at the population level display a key role in population size structure, mortality and recruitment. The elevated mortality rates recorded at some locations (almost 80%) is amongst the highest recorded for perennial algae as a consequence of a single storm, emphasizing the importance of episodic catastrophic events in the maintenance of these deep-water, slow-growing populations.

Islands present within a marine protected area (MPA) offer an extremely valuable system to test the hypotheses of large-scale spatial patterns in assemblages, particularly when patterns on the islands were contrasted with those of the mainland. In fact, besides the natural causes of variability, insular locations are generally less accessible to humans than those on the mainland, with changing levels of accessibility, on the basis of the distance from the coast. This study examined the interactive effect of protection and geographical siting at Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo MPA in Sardinia, Italy, on gastropod species subjected to human harvest. Rocky-shore gastropod assemblages were sampled at locations with different level combinations of protection and accessibility. Results highlighted that assemblages in the MPA have been more significantly influenced by the geographical siting of the locations rather than by protection, as the larger dissimilarities were observed between the mainland and island locations. These results can have important implications for the conservation of marine coastal assemblages, and provide important quantitative information for future estimation of the effects of protection of MPAs.

However, their trophic functioning remains poorly understood. In the Sine Saloum estuary (Senegal), a marine protected area (MPAs) was designated in 2003 to manage fisheries resources. The present study aimed to determine the structure, trophic functioning and seasonal patterns of the fish assemblages in this MPA. Throughout the study, 28 fish species were collected, with higher values of biomass (3826 kg km(-2)) recorded during the wet season and lower values during the dry season (1228 kg km(-2)). Fish assemblages in both seasons were dominated by species with marine affinity, which accounted for 87% of the total biomass in the wet season and 70% in the dry season, with their abundance varying from 83% to 57%, respectively. Based on stable isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15), species were combined into trophic groups. Primary consumers were partitioned into suspensivores (pelagic copepods, oysters and mussels), which fed mainly on particulate organic matter, and intermediate consumers, feeding on freshly deposited organic matter and benthic microalgae (Sarotherodon melanotheron and Arca senilis). Secondary consumers were divided into three groups. The first group included mullet, which fed by grazing on benthic microalgae (benthic affinity feeders). The second group, pelagic affinity feeders, was the most heterogeneous and fed mainly on pelagic components. The last secondary consumer group termed the intermediate group, included piscivores and benthic and pelagic invertebrate feeders, which dominated the top of the food web. The food chain in October was lengthened due to the occurrence of tertiary consumers. Food webs were dominated by secondary consumers, which constituted 89% of total biomass in the dry season and 71% in the wet season. The fish food web varied largely with season in faunal composition and food chain length. This study highlighted the need to take into account the seasonal dynamic of the food web both in terms of composition and structure to assess carbon fluxes in tropical estuaries.

We conducted visual surveys of fishes along six strip transects soon after the area was designated a marine reserve in 1995. then again in 2006 following an eleven-year period of complete protection. We recorded a total of 31 406 sightings of 72 species from 30 families.

This marine reserve was established in 2000 and is located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Vertical profiles of the holes visually identified from the multibeam data were extracted to characterize hole shape and determine changes in the height, width, and slope of each hole over time and space.

Height and slope also increased between 2006 and 2009. The shape changes present in the 151 holes identified in the same location between the 2 survey years suggest that while hole shape varies due to red grouper maintenance, holes are constructed and maintained over time.

Temporal trends in coral and algal cover were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. The model included the effect of depth levels (a fixed effect), monitoring plots (a random effect) as a nested factor within depths, and time (repeated factor). We found high spatial variability in major benthic components. Overall means indicated that algae were the most abundant biotic component in nearly all areas, ranging from 30.3% at Rosario to 53.3% at San Andres. Live coral cover varied considerably from 10.1% at Santa Marta up to 43.5% at Uraba. Coral and algae cover per se are not always accurate reef indicators and therefore they need supplementary information. Temporal analyses suggested relative stability of coral and algal cover along the study but the causes for the observed trends were rarely identified. A significant decrease (p=0.042) in coral cover was only identified for some monitoring plots in Tayrona-time x plot (depth level) interaction, and importantly, few coral species explained this trend. Significant increase (p=0.005) in algal cover was observed over time for most plots in Rosario. Temporal trajectories in algal cover were influenced by depth-significant time x depth interaction-in San Andras (increase, p=0.004) and Uraba (decrease, p=0.027).

Surveys of coral reefs in northern Tanzania were conducted in 2004/5 with the aim of comparing them over an similar to 8-year period during a time of increased efforts at fisheries management and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) coral mortality event that caused 45% mortality in northern Tanzania and much of the Indian Ocean.2. Changes associated with both management, its absence, and the ENSO were found but changes were generally small and ecological measures indicated stability or improvements over this period, particularly when compared with reports from much of the northern Indian Ocean.3. Fisheries management in two areas increased the biomass of fish and benthic communities. A small fisheries closure (0.3 km(2)) displayed little change in the coral community but ecological conditions declined as measured by sea urchins and fish abundances. This change may be associated with its small size because similar changes were not measured in the large closure (28 km(2)).4. The few sites without any increased management were still degraded and one site had experienced a population explosion of a pest sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei.5. The lack of significant changes across this disturbance indicates that these reefs are moderately resilient to climate change and, therefore, a high priority for future conservation actions.

We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.",871,2009,10.3354/meps08029,WOS:000267404000004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nominal CPUE series obtained from both logbook data and fishing interviews revealed that higher CPUEs were achieved inside the MPA during some fishing seasons, but there was no consistency in the data, since spatial and temporal variability were shown. The spatial distribution of monthly CPUE data was characterized by means of geostatistical analysis. Albacore schools tended to aggregate in mesoscale patches of similar dimensions but the location of these aggregations was non-stationary both in space and time. This supports the hypothesis that albacore are not randomly spatially distributed, but that they concentrated in certain areas where they find suitable conditions of food availability.

We measured spatial and temporal variability in larval supply and recruitment of fishes to coral reefs of different protection levels and tested whether protection level influenced the relationship between supply and recruitment. We sampled pre-settlement larvae and newly settled recruits from four reefs (two reserves and two non-reserves) in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, USA. Replicate point measures of larval supply over 14 months and 17 monthly measurements of recruitment varied significantly among months and sites. Sites with the same protection level had significantly different patterns of larval supply as well as larval and recruit diversity, but recruitment magnitude differed only by protection level, where densities were greater at reserves. Differences in larval supply among sites included two particularly large peaks in larval abundance at one site, possibly associated with the observed passage of small-scale oceanographic features. To examine whether relationships between larval supply and recruitment varied by protection level, we selected one species that was present in both the light trap samples and the monthly recruitment surveys. Recruitment of the bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus was significantly and positively related to larval supply at three of the four sites thus, protection level did not influence this linkage.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether protection has the same effect on the population structure of P lividus occurring in rocky reef habitats and in R oceanica beds. These results are important to generate hypotheses about the influence of human harvesting, predatory pressure and migration processes on R lividus in the two habitats.Paracentrotus lividus was sampled at seven locations within the Gulf of Alghero (North West Sardinia) where the Capo Caccia-Isola Piana MPA (Marine Protected Area) is sited: 1 location was sited in Zone A, where no harvesting of P. lividus is allowed (NH), 3 locations were sited in Zone B, where harvesting is restricted (RH), and the other 3 were located outside the MPA where no restrictions apply to sea urchin harvesting (UH). For each combination of habitat x location, R lividus density was assessed in 10 replicates using quadrats of 1 x 1 m and the size of 20 individuals (test diameter without spines) was measured. Finally, the specimens were grouped into size-classes to examine frequency distributions at each location. Sampling was performed at the end of the sea urchin harvesting period (April-May 2006). Analyses of data have highlighted significant variability among locations for both response variables. In both habitats, no differences were found in Paracentrotus lividus abundance among levels of protection (NH vs. RH vs. UH), while a significantly higher size was found in NH rather than in RH and UH locations. Differential direct and indirect effects of protection on P. lividus size is discussed. Also, P lividus size seemed dependent on the habitat being quite larger in Posidonia oceanica than in the rocky reefs. This finding suggests that settlement and recruitment could be more highly successful events in rocky habitats, and that in P. oceanica meadows large-sized immigrants coming from the rocky habitat contribute to the population structure. The need to define the role of the P. oceanica habitat is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyses of species numbers and total cover showed that site-to-site differences were generally very much greater than differences among times within sites. There were no significant differences among different geographical areas within the reef tract (Upper, Middle and Lower Keys). Large-scale changes documented included a reduction in species numbers and total cover on both deep and shallow offshore reefs between 1997 and 1999 followed by no recovery in cover, and only scant evidence of any recovery in species numbers by 2003. These changes coincided with bleaching events in 1997 and 1998, and the passage of Hurricane Georges through the Lower Keys in 1998. The lack of recovery among offshore reefs suggests that they were no longer resilient. Multivariate analyses revealed that some sites showed relatively little temporal variation in community composition, essentially random in direction, while others showed relatively large year-on-year changes. There was little evidence of any major region-wide changes affecting assemblage composition, or of any events that had impacted all of the sampling sites in any single year. Instead, different sites exhibited differing patterns of temporal variation, with certain sites displaying greater variation than others.

A total of 266 species of 40 families of coral reef fishes formed five distinct assemblages. Spatial variations in distribution and structure of the assemblages were associated with eight significant biological and physical variables which were cover of living hard corals, encrusting corals, branching corals, Acropora, Millepora, Montipora, depth and distance from the coast of the mainland. The six factors in front are likely related to provision of shelter and nutrition, while the distance factor is likely to represent a gradient in disturbance and impacts from various mainland sources including sedimentation and pollution discharge from nearby rivers.

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance.

Functional relationships for recruitment and predation mortality were developed by multiple regression analyses. The resultant model output compares well with observed data from the fishery. The model was then applied to simulate stock development over a 50 year time period using different management policies and a variety of environmental conditions. The investigated management policies reduce fishing mortality and range from a moratorium on the Eastern Baltic cod fishery via the establishment of a permanent or a seasonal marine reserve in ICES subdivision 25 to a fishing as usual scenario. The environmental conditions incorporated were based on the size of the reproductive volume (RV) and comprise a best case and a worst case of reproductive conditions, and two more realistic scenarios, where we assumed that a historic series of RV-sizes reoccurs over the simulation period. Our results show a strong dependence of stock dynamics on the environmental conditions. Under prevailing low RV, our model projects stock extinction by the year 2020, if fishing continues as usual. Under the restrictive scenarios, where fishing mortality is reduced either directly or by implementation of a marine reserve, the stock benefits from an increase in stock size and an improved age structure. A seasonal closure of subdivision (SD) 25 as opposed to a closure of the entire Baltic Sea appears to be sufficient to prevent the Eastern Baltic cod stock from failing below safe biological limits.

Still, conclusive evidence of their functioning is lacking, amongst others due to the influence of spatio-temporal variations in fish populations and habitat heterogeneity which could hamper a sound data interpretation. We conducted a spatial analysis of the benefits of the Medes Island Marine Reserve by combining geostatistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Concurrently, we analysed effects of trends reflecting habitat heterogeneity and spatial structuring of data on spatial predictions of fish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and length. Predicted spatial patterns showed the complexity and simultaneous action of trend factors leading to mostly non-linear gradients in CPUE and length data. CPUE of total fish and CPUE and length of common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) increased close to the Integral Reserve due to direct and indirect reserve effects. CPUE and length of striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) slightly increased also near the Integral Reserve, but distinct reserve effects could not be identified due to the strong influence of artificial reefs. We conclude that the spatial dimension of the Buffer Zone, where artisanal fisheries are allowed, permits in general protection only for target species, favouring a habitat with no discontinuities from the reserve outwards. Our spatial approach to assess reserve benefits provides major insights into complex systems like coastal marine reserves in the northwestern Mediterranean. In addition, it contributes to a crucial aspect of marine conservation, viz. the decision on the spatial dimension of protected areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant variability in the fish assemblages occurred between each park consistent with the latitudinal distribution of the parks. Fish assemblages also varied significantly between sites within each park. Contrary to expectations, total species richness did not follow the expected latitudinal gradient. However, observed geographical patterns in species richness of certain families such as Labridae (greater richness in the most northern park) and Monacanthidae (greater species richness in southern parks) followed expectations. Abundant schooling species, common to all 3 parks, were important contributors to variation between sites, Temporal variation over 5 yr at 1 park was relatively minor compared to the spatial variation among the 3 parks.

Reserves had general positive effects of protection on fish targeted by fishing, and variable effects on non-target species. Differences in the structure of fish assemblages (in terms of abundance of species and trophic groups) were greater between geographic locations than when compared among all protected and adjacent fished areas at the regional scale. These results suggest that the assemblage-wide response to protection at the species level may be spatially idiosyncratic, as a function of local factors. However, the functional (trophic group) response of the fish assemblages to protection appears to be more general. Response of fish assemblages to protection was significantly related to reserve age (i.e. duration of protection) only when evaluated at functional level, whereas reserve size did not appear to influence fish assemblages at either species or functional level. Reserves can enhance trophic cascades and ecological shifts once the density of fish predators of sea urchins reaches a density threshold of about 15 adult sea breams (Diplodus sargus and D. vulgaris, the most important sea urchin predators) per 100 m(2).

Reef fish communities modifications within the MPAs are now well known but their interactions with unprotected areas still needs to be quantified. Prior to the study of reef fish movement patterns between MPAs and unprotected reefs, the present study was planed to compare the coral reef fish communities of two fished reefs (Crouy and Laregnere reefs) and one protected reef (Laregnere islet) within the Park. Twelve stations were sampled on each reef using underwater visual census techniques. Three point counts were completed at each station; one on the reef flat, one on the upper part of the reef slope and one on the lower part of the reef slope. Species richness, density and biomass of all edible species in the Pacific and of commercial species in New Caledonia were calculated. No significant difference occurred between reefs for edible fish and all three indices. Significant differences occurred for the commercial species, with higher values on the protected reef for all three indices. Species richness was 15% and 28% higher, density 65% and 107% higher and biomass 94% and 158% higher in the reserve than in the unprotected reefs. Significant differences occurred for the most valuable commercial families; Serranids, Siganids, commercial Acanthurids and commercial Labrids, which were also more important in the protected reef. These effects were less significant for the Scarids. Only few species, e.g. Chlorurus microrhinos, which is one of the most targeted parrotfish, have significant higher density and biomass in the protected area. Three species assemblages were identified using a Correspondence Analysis: one assemblage affected by cyclone Erica, one protected assemblage and one unprotected assemblage. A comparison with the results of a Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that these assemblages were primarily related to reef status and secondarily to substrate characteristics. Protection measures were responsible for a modification of reef fish organisation despite a significant effect of habitat structure. The density of commercial species in fished areas near the protected area was higher than in the reserve before the protection was effective. These results and the relative stability of the protected community during 9 years support the hypothesis of significant interactions between protected reefs and nearby unprotected reefs.

If successful, protected areas have the potential to increase the level of resource rent derived from the extraction of fishery resources.In this paper, a stochastic bioeconomic model of a multi-species fishery is used to test the performance of protected areas as a management tool in a two patch, two species fishery with heterogeneous environments. The differences in the environments occur through each patch having its own growth rates and internal dynamics. Protected areas are analyzed under density-dependent and sink-source dispersal relationships between the environments within the fishery. These relationships define the drivers of the dispersal of biomass, and as such, will influence the outcome from protected area creation.The model is applied to a section of the NSW fishing industry located in the Manning Bioregion. The NSW Government has committed to the establishment of a representative system of marine parks in coastal waters. The aim of protected area creation is to protect unique elements of NSW marine habitats. The primary focus for protected area establishment is not as a tool for fisheries management; however, it is likely to lead to some effects on the NSW commercial fishing industry. In 2004, an assessment of the Manning Self Bioregion, which spans north of the Hunter river to north of Nambucca Heads, was completed and identified an area between Stockton Beach and Wallis Lake as the likely area for a new marine parkThe results from the model under the assumption homogenous catch show that protected area can be used as a fisheries management tool in the Manning Bioregion under certain conditions. Both the nature and extent of the dispersal from the protected area are key features in determining the economic outcome from protected area creation. The greater the level of dispersal, the greater the benefits from protected area establishment as more of the biomass that occurs within the protected area is likely to flow to the surrounding fishery, offsetting the effects of reduced fishing area. The value of small sized protected areas is enhanced through the density-dependent flows. Under sink-source flows, differences in relative densities do not encourage increased flows from the protected areas due to differences in patch population density, making the level of dispersal more dependent on protected area size. Given this, when sink-source flows are likely, a minimum size protected area is required before benefits to the fishery can be obtained.The creation of a marine protected area in the Manning Bioregion is likely to have different distributional effects on the two fisheries examined in this paper. For the prey fishery, the Ocean Prawn Trawl Fishery, the benefits of protected area creation are limited by the effects of predation. As such, the protected area is less likely to increase harvests and fishery rent post establishment. Further, certain sized protected areas increased the variability of harvests, meaning that overall harvests were not only reduced but more variable. The counter occurred for the predator fishery, the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery, which is more likely to benefit from protected area creation as increased prey and the removal of fishing pressure increased the biomass of targeted species in the fishery. Despite the potential gain, in the open fishing grounds harvests of these species is likely to become more variable.For the two fisheries as a whole, the creation certain sized protected areas can yield some hedge benefits in terms of overall harvests and resource rent. However, for this to occur, a minimum size is required. Small sized protected areas are less likely to yield hedge benefits to the fishery, with medium to large more likely. The reason for this is that smaller sized protected areas do not increase biomass greatly above exploited levels, reducing the ability for biomass in the protected area to reduce normal fluctuations in populations caused through environmental stochasticity.",0,2005,,WOS:000290114102086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that under the conditions of variability tested, reserves can increase the probability of achieving target levels of biomass (60%, 35%, and 5% of carrying capacity) and can reduce catch variability in neighbouring fisheries, making future planning in the fishery more efficient. The size of the reserve required to meet each objective will depend on the initial condition of the stock and the exploitation rate in the fishery. Reserve coverage of between 20% and 40% prevent stock collapse in most cases. In heavily exploited fisheries, reserves are also likely to enhance mean catches, particularly in highly variable systems. If the stock has previously been heavily exploited, large reserves (greater than or equal to60%) may be required to significantly increase the probability of achieving target biomass levels. However, once stocks have recovered, reserve coverage may be reduced without a reduction in this probability of success.",22,2004,10.1139/f04-142,WOS:000227073300003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Violation of MPAs will typically occur near boundaries, so perimeter-to-area ratios will be important determinants of actual protection, suggesting that MPAs should be larger and likely fewer If larval dispersal is highly localized, however, MPAs will need to be more numerous, widespread, and likely smaller in order to replenish many fished areas. Thus, there is a discord between the MPA network that would best achieve external replenishment and that which would maximize compliance. I investigated these competing criteria with a spatially structured model of a hypothetical marine fishery exploiting a sedentary reef-dwelling organism. With full compliance, a network of several small MPAs protects a population of similar size to that in a single large MPA and produces higher fishery yield across a range of fishing mortality rates. As noncompliance increases, however the protected population in the network of several small MPAs approaches zero, whereas the single, large MPA population declines much less. Furthermore, at high levels of fishing mortality and noncompliance, yield with the network of several small MPAs begins to mirror that with no MPAs and drops below the yield with the single large MRA. Temporal variability in both the protected population size and yield are similar between the two designs with full compliance, but the single large MPA provides much greater stability in both metrics at high fishing mortality rates as noncompliance increases. My results highlight the important effects of noncompliance in realized MPA benefits and can explain why observed and expected effects might differ Moreover, my results support a call for increased attention to rates of noncompliance and their ecological effects and greater collaboration among natural scientists, social scientists, managers, and stakeholders in understanding and altering illegal behavior.",66,2004,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00022.x,WOS:000222979400023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, global policy has preceded the development of generic models and experience to underpin the design of effective MPAs for sustainable fisheries. Four main classes of potential benefits can be identified for MPAs in fisheries-biological support for the exploited stock, socioeconomic benefits for the fishers, biodiversity benefits for the fished ecosystems, and increased fishery stability. The extent to which any MPA will achieve these benefits depends on its design, its integration with the broader fishery management system, and the effectiveness of the existing stock management. An MPA may deliver only limited additional support for a stock that is already well managed, but an appropriately designed MPA may be able to offer other benefits to the fishery such as an ecological offset for the effects of fishing on habitats. Delivering these benefits depends on establishing a priori design principles and decision rules in relation to each specified objective that an MPA is established to achieve. Measuring the benefits requires a performance assessment and reporting system, including specific performance indicators, that is directly linked to the objectives of the MPA. The biggest single threat to the success of fisheries MPAs is model failure-the situation where MPAs are established that do not reflect the implicit and explicit sustainability objectives of the fishery. Fisheries MPAs established without comprehensive design and performance assessment systems are likely to be neither successful nor secure and are unlikely to meet medium-term or long-term sustainability objectives.",5,2004,,WOS:000223814600006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, active suspension feeders have been the main focus of research, while passive suspension feeders have received less attention. To increase our understanding of energy fluxes in temperate marine ecosystems, we have examined the temporal variability in zooplankton prey capture of the ubiquitous Mediterranean gorgonian Leptogorgia sarmentosa. Prey capture was assessed on the basis of gut content from colonies collected every 2 weeks over a year. The digestion time of zooplankton prey was examined over the temperature range of the species at the study site. The main prey items captured were small (80-200 mum), low-motile zooplankton (i.e. eggs and invertebrate larvae). The digestion time of zooplankton prey increased when temperature decreased (about 150% from 21degreesC to 13degreesC; 15 h at 13degreesC, 9 h at 17degreesC, and 6 h at 21degreesC), a pattern which has not previously been documented in anthozoans. Zooplankton capture rate (prey polyp(-1) h(-1)) varied among seasons, with the greatest rates observed in spring (0.16+/-0.02 prey polyp(-1) h(-1)). Ingestion rate in terms of biomass (mug C polyp(-1) h(-1)) showed a similar trend, but the differences among the seasons were attenuated by seasonal differences in prey size. Therefore, ingestion rate did not significantly vary over the annual cycle and averaged 0.019+/-0.002 mug C polyp(-1) h(-1). At the estimated ingestion rates, the population of L. sarmentosa removed between 2.3 and 16.8 mg C m(-2) day(-1) from the adjacent water column.

Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that species abundance and the biomass of reef fish populations is higher within than outside marine reserves, and that a north-to-south geographical gradient of these variables exists. We also explored the relationship between the fish assemblage and habitat structure, as an environmental factor likely to account for an important part of the observed variability. The mixed analyses of variance revealed that total abundance and biomass, species richness and abundance and biomass of several target species reached higher average values within marine reserves. Nevertheless, some non-protected localities (e.g. Aguilas) harboured richer and more abundant fish assemblages than some marine reserves. In addition, regional variation, attributable to differences in local carrying capacity and hydroclimatic conditions, are also shown across the studied area. Moreover, the studied assemblage is patchy at small and/or intermediate spatial scales, considering both assemblage descriptors (total abundance and biomass, species richness), and the abundance and biomass of fish species and spatial categories. Detected patterns were different depending on the species and assemblage variables analysed. Differences in habitat structure account for a significant proportion of total variability of the studied variables, and are likely to be responsible for a large part of the observed differences, especially at small-to-intermediate spatial scales. Other factors-spatial variability in larval distribution, settlement and/or post-settlement survival-are discussed in order to explain the observed differences.

This was a result of a trophic cascade thought to be an indirect effect of increased predator abundance. We assessed further changes in communities from 1996 to 2000, differences in benthic communities between reserve and adjacent unprotected sites, and the stability of these patterns from 1999 to 2001. Since 1996, densities of sea urchins Evechinus chloroticus have continued to decline in shallow areas of the reserve (< 8 m), and all sites classified as urchin barrens in 1978. are now dominated by large brown algae. Comparisons between reserve and non-reserve sites revealed differences consistent with a trophic cascade at reserve sites. The greatest differences in algal communities between reserve and non-reserve sites occurred at depths where E. chloroticus was most abundant (4 to 6 m). Reserve sites had lower urchin densities and reduced extent of urchin barrens habitat with higher biomass of the 2 dominant algal species (Ecklonia radiata and Caipophyllum maschalocarpum). At reserve sites densities of exposed E. chloroticus (openly grazing the substratum) declined so that urchin barrens were completely absent by 2001. Lower density of the limpet Cellana stellifera and higher densities of the turbinid gastropod Cookia sulcata at reserve sites are thought to be responses to changes in habitat structure, representing additional indirect effects of increased predators. The overall difference in community types between reserve and non-reserve sites remained stab le between 1999 and 2001. Localised urchin mortality events due to an unknown agent were recorded at some sites adjacent to the marine reserve. Only at 1 of these sites did exposed urchins decline below the critical density of 1 m(-2), which resulted in the total replacement of urchin barrens with macroalgae-dominated habitats. At other sites urchin barrens have remained stable. Declines in the limpet C. stellifera occurred across all sites between 1999 and 2001 and may be indirectly associated with urchin declines. Long-term changes in benthic communities in the Leigh reserve and the stability of differences between reserve and non-reserve sites over time are consistent with gradual declines in urchin densities due to increased predation on urchins, thus providing further evidence for a trophic cascade in this system. The rapid declines in urchin numbers at some unprotected sites, however, demonstrate how short-term disturbances, such as disease, may result in shifts in community types over much shorter time frames.",266,2003,10.3354/meps246001,WOS:000181085100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the population (about 80%) is located in shallow areas (less than 10 m depth) whatever the location. Shallow water populations were made of small and medium size individuals (< 50 mm in diameter) while deep water populations were made of large individuals (> 50 mm in diameter). These large individuals accounted for 57% of the population in deep areas while they only represented 11% in shallow habitats. Since the recruitment in the deep waters cannot explain the abundance of large individuals, we suggest that larger individuals originate from shallow water populations, migrating to deep habitats while growing. In addition to differences linked to depth, we also observed significant differences between localities, higher abundances of sea-urchin being observed in the marine protected area than outside (193.6 vs. 82.5 ind. per 10 m(2)). However, rather than a protection effect, such result seems to be the consequence of a lower recruitment outside the protected area as the lower abundance of juveniles was observed out of the protected area. This last observation demonstrates the existence of a micro-geographic variability in the population structure of Paracentrotus lividus and much attention should be paid on this aspect prior to test the protection effect.",16,2002,,WOS:000178254600006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diving surveys were undertaken to investigate the effects of marine reserve protection on spiny lobster (Jasus edwardsii) populations at Tonga Island Marine Reserve, northern South Island, New, Zealand over a 2 year period from December 1998 to December 2000.2. Spiny lobsters were 2.8 times more abundant overall, and mean size was 19 mm carapace length larger in shallow transects and 228 turn carapace length larger in deep transects, in the marine reserve than at adjacent fished sites. That pattern was evident despite very high variability within sites, and among sites within reserve and fished areas.3. Large reproductive males Were 10 times more abundant within the reserve compared to adjacent fished areas, suggesting that more eggs would be fertilized in the reserve than on the adjacent fished coast.4. Estimates of size-specific fecundity, combined with abundances of females, suggested that almost nine times more eggs would be produced in the reserve than in fished areas.5. Diving and commercial trapping investigations found weak trends in spiny lobster abundance consistent with gradients at reserve borders. Tagging investigations near those borders led to only one resighting of a tagged spiny lobster.6. We estimate that the mean abundance of spiny lobster in the reserve has increased by 22%, 5 years after its establishment, indicating an annual population increase of 4.4%. Over the same period, abundance of spiny lobster outside the reserve has declined by 2.9% per annum.7. Based on known spiny lobster movements, we suggest that marine reserves of more than 10 km length should be given priority over smaller reserves. Smaller reserves will, however, protect part of the population for at least a portion of their lifespan.8. Previous studies of movement of J. edwardsii suggest that spillover from the reserve should occur, and as population density increases we predict that more spiny lobsters will move out from the reserve.

Overall, there was a slight (11%) but significant increase in fish species number inside marine reserves, with all reserves sharing a common effect. There was a substantial but non-significant increase in overall fish abundance inside marine reserves compared to adjacent, non-reserve areas. When only species that are the target of fisheries were considered, fish abundance was significantly higher (by 28%) within reserve boundaries. Marine reserves vary significantly in the extent and direction of their response. This variability in relative abundance was not attributable to differences in survey methodology among studies, nor correlated with reserve characteristics such as reserve area, years since protection, latitude nor species diversity. The effectiveness of marine reserves in enhancing fish abundance may be largely related to the intensity of exploitation outside reserve boundaries and to the composition of the fish community within boundaries. It is recommended that studies of marine reserve effectiveness, should routinely report fishing intensity, effectiveness of enforcement and habitat characteristics.

Population density, species richness, and rarity were estimated for 127 species of coral reef fish on 22 patch and fringing reefs along similar to 400 km of East African coastline. The reefs included five protected areas, of which three study sites were protected for more than 25 years, and four sites were protected less than 10 years. Habitat variables were often significantly associated with fish community variables in fringing reefs, but not in patch reefs. Fish diversity was positively correlated with hard coral and coralline algal cover, and negatively correlated with sea urchin and algal turf abundance. However, multiple regression analysis suggests that protection from fishing was the single strongest factor affecting fish abundance and diversity. Consequently, many of the habitat correlations were probably due to direct and indirect effects of fishing on reef ecology, where heavy fishing results in increases in sea urchin and algal turf abundance and reduces hard coral and coralline algal abundance. Protected areas had higher abundances and species richness of commercially important triggerfish, surgeonfish, and parrotfish. There was, however, no relationship between local rarity in our study sites with rarity at the level of the western Indian Ocean for three well known fish families of angelfish, butterflyfish, and damselfish. Older reserves had more and rarer species than young reserves or fished reefs; and, consequently, the maintenance of reserves older than 10 years may be needed to sustain the full local diversity of fishes.",154,2001,10.2307/3060909,WOS:000167876900019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modeled theoretical populations are structured according to age and size. The predatory behavior rules by which they interact are implemented at the fish school level. Each species is attributed a mean distribution area within which, at each simulated year, the larval production is randomly distributed. The results of the simulations show that at high fishing rates, the setting of an MPA can enable the maintenance of the mean overall catches at a high level. In particular, for exploitation rates resulting in mortality rates greater than F-msy, implementing different sizes of MPA highlights the existence of an optimal size for the MPA. Furthermore, the comparison of the effects induced by the direct reduction of the fishing effort, and by the closing of some fishing areas, suggests that this latter management measure is more efficient in terms of catch maximization and biodiversity conservation. This theoretical advantage is supposed to result from a particularity inherent to implementation of MPAs, which would indeed enable the preservation of not only a global fraction of the populations but also a set of trophic interactions that are localized in space and time.

Abundance of the sea urchin Paracentrotus Lividus (Lamarck) was monitored at 7 sites (4 inside and 3 outside the reserve), and 2 distinct habitats (fields of big boulders and vertical walls). P. Lividus exhibited significant variability in density over time on boulders, both inside and outside the reserve, whereas its density did not vary significantly on vertical walls. P. lividus populations differed significantly in size-structure across sites, varying from unimodal to bimodal among sites and years. Density and mean size of P. lividus were not significantly different between the protected and the unprotected area in either of the 2 habitats. Abundance of the sea urchin Arbacia lixula (L.) was monitored from 1995 to 1997 on vertical walls and boulders (4 sites inside and 3 sites outside the reserve). Density of A. lixula differed significantly over time on boulders, but it did not on walls. On vertical walls, density and mean size of A. lixula were not significantly different between areas in both habitats. This study shows that in the Medes Islands region, sea urchins exhibit striking short-term fluctuations in abundance, which can lead to misinterpretation of larger-scale temporal patterns. The comparison between the protected and the unprotected area does not support the hypothesis of fish predation as the most important factor affecting P. lividus populations in the Medes Islands, as patterns of lower sea urchin density relative to the unprotected area nearby were not maintained over time.

In 1992, we used the same methodology to assess if variations occurred in this fish community between these two samplings. In both 1980 and 1992, water depth affected the relative abundance of fish communities and the number of species was roughly maintained in both sites. However, there were several other important qualitative and quantitative variations in the fish fauna over this period: (1) The abundance of species has decreased in the integral reserve whereas it has been maintained outside the reserve; (2) Nine species are more abundant in the integral reserve and nine others are more abundant outside the reserve. Among the species vulnerable to fishing, such as Labrus merula, Symphodus tinca, Mullus surmuletus, Diplodus sargus, D. vulgaris, Scorpaena porcus, Oblada melanura, 6 of them are more abundant inside the integral reserve and 4 others are more abundant outside; (3) The demographic structure of vulnerable species inside the reserve has changed: only the proportion of large fish (30 to 40 cm length) compared to medium (15 to 30 cm) and small (0 to 15 cm) fishes was higher in the integral reserve. The prohibition of recreational and professional fisheries and scuba diving has the fish community in the integral marine reserve in 1992 enhanced less than in 1980.

A key goal of marine protected areas (MPAs) is to maintain stability in species composition, via reduced turnover, to support ecosystem function. Yet, this stability is rarely measured directly under different levels of protection. Rather, evaluations of MPA efficacy generally consist of static measures of abundance, species richness, and biomass, and rare measures of turnover are limited to short-term studies involving pairwise (beta diversity) comparisons. Zeta diversity is a recently developed metric of turnover that allows for measurement of compositional similarity across multiple assemblages and thus provides more comprehensive estimates of turnover. We evaluated the effectiveness of MPAs at preserving fish zeta diversity across a network of marine reserves over 10 years in Batemans Marine Park, Australia. Snorkel transect surveys were conducted across multiple replicated and spatially interspersed sites to record fish species occurrence through time. Protection provided by MPAs conferred greater stability in fish species turnover. Marine protected areas had significantly shallower decline in zeta diversity compared with partially protected and unprotected areas. The retention of harvested species was four to six times greater in MPAs compared with partially protected and unprotected areas, and the stabilizing effects of protection were observable within 4 years of park implementation. Conversely, partial protection offered little to no improvement in stability, compared with unprotected areas.

Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management failure, including risk-prone quota setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it.",247,2005,10.1098/rstb.2004.1578,WOS:000227514700010,review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,variability,,,stability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the links between reserve effect and temporal variability of assemblages remains equivocal. The present study presents the results obtained in a long-term series of annual surveys in the Scandola Marine Reserve (Corsica, North-western Mediterranean). An underwater visual census was performed on Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. Species richness and density of target fish were positively affected by fishing prohibition in the no-take zone. The whole assemblage density and density of non-target and prey fish, prevailing in the seagrass bed, were not or negatively affected by fishing prohibition. Concomitantly, temporal stability was positively related to fishing prohibition. This stabilisation of the fish assemblage in the no-take zone had not been observed over rocky reefs in previous studies. This outcome may be linked to wandering predators of rocky areas, preying upon seagrass fish assemblages. In addition, the complete fishing ban appeared to be to only effective tool in restoring target fish stocks and maintaining a higher stability of the fish assemblage whereas partial fishing prohibition failed to meet this goal.",16,2014,10.1071/MF13080,WOS:000331621400006,field,CI,1989-1999,MPA,Scandola,24,old,1975,fully,2,0.72,7.22,small,NA,France,subtropical,Europe,Mediterranean sea,seagrass,NA,ecological,fish,mix,mix,mix,,,,variability,,coefficient of variation,stability,table 5,positive,yes,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,20.73,120.00,NA,NA,39.1,360,NA,NA,0.634540541,,BZ not taken as a control because PPA; IZ not taken because very low fishing pressure.
