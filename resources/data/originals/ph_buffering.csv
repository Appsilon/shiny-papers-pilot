However, recent discoveries of diverse and high cover reefs that already live under extreme conditions suggest that some corals might thrive well under hot, high-pCO(2), and deoxygenated seawater. Volcanic CO2 vents, semi-enclosed lagoons, and mangrove estuaries are unique study sites where one or more ecologically relevant parameters for life in the oceans are close to or even worse than currently projected for the year 2100. Although they do not perfectly mimic future conditions, these natural laboratories offer unique opportunities to explore the mechanisms that reef species could use to keep pace with climate change. To achieve this, it is essential to characterize their environment as a whole and accurately consider all possible environmental factors that may differ from what is expected in the future, possibly altering the ecosystem response.This study focuses on the semi-enclosed lagoon of Bourake (New Caledonia, southwest Pacific Ocean) where a healthy reef ecosystem thrives in warm, acidified, and deoxygenated water. We used a multi-scale approach to characterize the main physical-chemical parameters and mapped the benthic community composition (i.e., corals, sponges, and macroalgae). The data revealed that most physical and chemical parameters are regulated by the tide, strongly fluctuate three to four times a day, and are entirely predictable. The seawater pH and dissolved oxygen decrease during falling tide and reach extreme low values at low tide (7.2 pH(T) and 1.9 mg O-2 L-1 at Bourake vs. 7.9 pH(T) and 5.5 mg O-2 L(-1 )at reference reefs). Dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH fluctuate according to the tide by up to 4.91 mg O-2 L-1, 6.50 degrees C, and 0.69 pH(T) units on a single day. Furthermore, the concentration of most of the chemical parameters was 1 to 5 times higher at the Bourake lagoon, particularly for organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen but also for some nutrients, notably silicates. Surprisingly, despite extreme environmental conditions and altered seawater chemical composition measured at Bourake, our results reveal a diverse and high cover community of macroalgae, sponges, and corals accounting for 28, 11, and 66 species, respectively. Both environmental variability and nutrient imbalance might contribute to their survival under such extreme environmental conditions.

Increasing CO2 emissions are driving a range of environmental changes, and one of the key concerns is the rapid acceleration of ocean acidification and associated reduction in pH. Such changes in seawater chemistry are anticipated to have direct negative effects on calcifying organisms, which could, in turn, have negative ecological, economic and human health impacts. However, these calcifying organisms do not exist in isolation, but rather are part of complex ecosystems. Here, we use a qualitative narrative synthesis framework to explore (i) how habitat-forming organisms can act to restrict environmental stress, both now and in the future; (ii) the ways their capacity to do so is modified by local context; and (iii) their potential to buffer the effects of future change through physiological processes and how this can be influenced by management adopted. Specifically, we highlight examples that consider the ability of macroalgae and seagrasses to alter water carbonate chemistry, influence resident organisms under current conditions and their capacity to do so under future conditions, while also recognizing the potential role of other habitats such as adjacent mangroves and saltmarshes. Importantly, we note that the outcome of interactions between these functional groups will be context dependent, influenced by the local abiotic and biotic characteristics. This dependence provides local managers with opportunities to create conditions that enhance the likelihood of successful amelioration. Where individuals and populations are managed effectively, habitat formers could provide local refugia for resident organisms of ecological and economic importance under an acidifying ocean.",0,2021,10.1093/conphys/coab077,WOS:000722579300001,review,CI,mix,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,NA,ecological,mix,mix,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,pH,text ,positive,no,pH unit,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,this article is a review

This phytoremediation, by macrophytes, is expected to reduce the severity of acidification in nearshore habitats on short timescales. Characterizing the efficacy of phytoremediation can be challenging as residence time, tidal mixing, freshwater input, and a limited capacity to fully constrain the carbonate system can lead to erroneous conclusions. Here, we present in situ observations of carbonate chemistry relationships to seagrass habitats by comparing dense (DG), patchy (PG), and no grass (NG) Zostera marina pools in the high intertidal experiencing intermittent flooding. High-frequency measurements of pH, alkalinity (TA), and total-CO2 elucidate extreme diel cyclicity in all parameters. The DG pool displayed frequent decoupling between pH and aragonite saturation state (Omega(arg)) suggesting pH-based inferences of acidification remediation by seagrass can be misinterpreted as pH and Omega(arg) can be independent stressors for some bivalves. Estimates show the DG pool had an integrated Delta TA of 550 mu mol kg(-1) over a 12 h period, which is similar to 60%>the PG and NG pools.

In the case of ocean acidification (OA), submerged marine macrophytes, such as seagrasses, may create local areas of elevated pH due to their capacity to sequester dissolved inorganic carbon through photosynthesis. However, although seagrasses may increase seawater pH during the day, they can also decrease pH at night due to respiration. Therefore, it remains unclear how consequences of such diel fluctuations may unfold for organisms vulnerable to OA. We established mesocosms containing different levels of seagrass biomass (Zostera marina) to create a gradient of carbonate chemistry conditions and explored consequences for growth of juvenile and adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas), a non-native species widely used in aquaculture that can co-occur, and is often grown, in proximity to seagrass beds. In particular, we investigated whether increased diel fluctuations in pH due to seagrass metabolism affected oyster growth. Seagrasses increased daytime pH up to 0.4 units but had little effect on nighttime pH (reductions less than 0.02 units). Thus, both the average pH and the amplitude of diel pH fluctuations increased with greater seagrass biomass. The highest seagrass biomass increased oyster shell growth rate (mm day(-1)) up to 40%. Oyster somatic tissue weight and oyster condition index exhibited a different pattern, peaking at intermediate levels of seagrass biomass. This work demonstrates the ability of seagrasses to facilitate oyster calcification and illustrates how non-trophic metabolic interactions can modulate effects of environmental change.",1,2021,10.1007/s00442-021-04949-0,WOS:000655605500001,laboratory,CI,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,United States,subtropical,North America,North Pacific Ocean,seagrass,NA,ecological,seagrass,Zostera marina,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,pH,Table 1,neutral,yes,pH unit,SD,,,,,,,,,8.035,28,0.013,0.114017543,7.965,28,0.009125,0.095524866,0.07,2.21E-02,

Amelioration by seagrass ecosystems compared to non-vegetated areas occurred 65% of the time (mean increase 0.07 +/- 0.008 SE). Events of continuous elevation in pH within seagrass ecosystems, indicating amelioration of low pH, were longer and of greater magnitude than opposing cases of reduced pH or exacerbation. Sustained elevations in pH of >0.1, comparable to a 30% decrease in [H+], were not restricted only to daylight hours but instead persisted for up to 21 days.

In the face of ocean acidification (OA), such natural pH variations may modulate an organism's response to OA by providing temporal refugia. We investigated the effect of pH fluctuations, generated by the brown alga Fucus serratus' biological activity, on the calcifying epibionts Balanus improvisus and Electra pilosa under OA. For this, both epibionts were grown on inactive and biologically active surfaces and exposed to (1) constant pH scenarios under ambient (pH 8.1) or OA conditions (pH 7.7), or (2) oscillating pH scenarios mimicking BBL conditions at ambient (pH 7.7-8.6) or OA scenarios (pH 7.4-8.2). Furthermore, all treatment combinations were tested at 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Against our expectations, OA treatments did not affect epibiont growth under constant or fluctuating (BBL) pH conditions, indicating rather high robustness against predicted OA scenarios. Furthermore, epibiont growth was hampered and not fostered on active surfaces (fluctuating DBL conditions), indicating that fluctuating pH conditions of the DBL with elevated daytime pH do not necessarily provide temporal refugia from OA. In contrast, results indicate that factors other than pH may play larger roles for epibiont growth on macrophytes (e.g., surface characteristics, macrophyte antifouling defense, or dynamics of oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Warming enhanced epibiont growth rates significantly, independently of OA, indicating no synergistic effects of pH treatments and temperature within their natural temperature range.",0,2021,10.1002/lno.11669,WOS:000599349500001,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the experimental design doesn't match with our interest, no usable data or direction"

However, corresponding in situ observations of marine species or ecosystem changes that can be unequivocally attributed to anthropogenic OA are limited. Challenges remain in detecting and attributing OA effects in nature, in part because multiple environmental changes are co-occurring with OA, all of which have the potential to influence marine ecosystem responses. Furthermore, the change in ocean pH since the industrial revolution is small relative to the natural variability within many systems, making it difficult to detect, and in some cases, has yet to cross physiological thresholds. The small number of studies that clearly document OA impacts in nature cannot be interpreted as a lack of larger-scale attributable impacts at the present time or in the future but highlights the need for innovative research approaches and analyses. We summarize the general findings in four relatively well-studied marine groups (seagrasses, pteropods, oysters, and coral reefs) and integrate overarching themes to highlight the challenges involved in detecting and attributing the effects of OA in natural environments. We then discuss four potential strategies to better evaluate and attribute OA impacts on species and ecosystems. First, we highlight the need for work quantifying the anthropogenic input of CO2 in coastal and open-ocean waters to understand how this increase in CO2 interacts with other physical and chemical factors to drive organismal conditions. Second, understanding OA-induced changes in population-level demography, potentially increased sensitivities in certain life stages, and how these effects scale to ecosystem-level processes (e.g. community metabolism) will improve our ability to attribute impacts to OA among co-varying parameters. Third, there is a great need to understand the potential modulation of OA impacts through the interplay of ecology and evolution (eco-evo dynamics). Lastly, further research efforts designed to detect, quantify, and project the effects of OA on marine organisms and ecosystems utilizing a comparative approach with long-term data sets will also provide critical information for informing the management of marine ecosystems.",8,2020,10.1093/icesjms/fsaa094,WOS:000610522000003,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the review isn't considering any in situ article on the ability of seagrass to buffer the  OA

Carbonate chemistry predicts that mixture of such warm freshwater with seawater will create rapid consumption of the freshwater carbon dioxide (CO2) by the carbonate buffering capacity of the seawater. In this study, we used the Paraiba do Sul River as a laboratory to investigate how thermodynamics compare with biological processes, gas exchange, and tidal advection from mangrove. We conducted three spatial surveys covering the salinity gradient of the main channel and surrounding mangrove waters and one 24-h mooring in a mangrove creek. In the main channel, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) showed closely conservative distribution along the salinity gradient, increasing seaward. The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) followed a bell-shaped curve predicted by carbonate chemistry for conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers. During high river flow, pCO(2) sharply decreased between salinities 0 and 5 (1800 to 390 ppmv), a pCO(2) drawdown attributed to riverine outgassing and thermodynamics. Indeed, the mixing of TA-poor freshwater (363 +/- 16 mu mol kg(-1)) with TA-rich seawater creates a deficit of dissolved CO2 not related to biotic processes. During low river flow, the entire mixing zone was undersaturated in pCO(2) with an increasing trend seaward. However, observed pCO(2) values were slightly above those predicted by conservativity. Approximately half of this deviation was attributed to biological activity (net heterotrophy), and remaining deviation was assigned to the effects of gas exchange (18%) and water heating (36%). The effect of gas exchange was higher in fresh and low salinity waters, reflecting the higher outgassing/ingassing of CO2, and lower buffering capacity. Water heating was more important in mid- to high-salinities as a result of diel patterns of solar irradiance. Heterotrophy was slight and not able to outcompete thermodynamics and generate outgassing during estuarine mixing. Consistently, stable isotopic signatures of DIC (delta C-13-DIC) presented slight deviations below the conservative mixing, corroborating net heterotrophy in the main channel. Areas of CO2 uptake due to phytoplankton activity were identified but restricted to the freshwater endmember during low river flow, with lowest pCO(2) (up to 41 ppmv) and the highest chlorophyll a (up to 21.3 mu g L-1). The estuary was a CO2 sink during low river flow ( - 1.34 to -5.26 mmolC m(-2) d(-1)) and a source during high river flow (5.71 to 19.37 mmolC m(-2) d(-1)). In the mangrove creek, the pCO(2), DIC, delta C-13-DIC and TA presented deviations from the conservativity, with slopes between TA and DIC demonstrating organic carbon degradation mediated by aerobic respiration and sulphate reduction. Mangrove creek waters were a CO2 source (average of 134.81 mmolC m(-2) d(-1)), exhibiting high values of pCO(2) (up to 21,720 ppmv). The results reveal that the low buffering capacity in the main channel of tropical estuarine deltas can be the predominant driver of pCO(2), generating CO2 undersaturation along the mixing zone, a process overlooked in estuarine systems.Moreover, air-water CO2 exchange, thermal variability, and biological activities contribute to deviation of the carbonate system from conservative mixing in specific estuarine areas, also modulating pCO(2) variability.",6,2020,10.1016/j.marchem.2020.103869,WOS:000579000900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In coastal waters, acidification is often enhanced by CO2 and acids produced under high rates of biological respiration. However, less is known about buffering processes that counter coastal acidification in eutrophic and seasonally hypoxic water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Here, we use carbonate chemistry, mineralogical analyses and geochemical modelling to demonstrate the occurrence of a bay-wide pH-buffering mechanism resulting from spatially decoupled calcium carbonate mineral cycling. In summer, high rates of photosynthesis by dense submerged aquatic vegetation at the head of the bay and in shallow, nearshore areas generate high pH, an elevated carbonate mineral saturation state and net alkalinity uptake. Calcium carbonate particles produced under these conditions are subsequently transported downstream into corrosive subsurface waters, where their dissolution buffers pH decreases caused by aerobic respiration and anthropogenic CO2. Because this pH-buffering mechanism would be strengthened by further nutrient load reductions and associated submerged aquatic vegetation recovery, our findings suggest that the reduction of nutrient inputs into coastal waters will not only reduce eutrophication and hypoxia, but also alleviate the severity of coastal ocean acidification.",14,2020,10.1038/s41561-020-0584-3,WOS:000539293600010,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the experimental design doesn't match with our interest, no usable data or direction"

These effects are often ignored or treated as a calculation uncertainty in many aquatic CO2 studies. This study evaluated OrgAlk variability, sources, and characteristics in estuarine waters exchanged tidally with a groundwater-influenced salt marsh in the northeast USA. OrgAlk provided a biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling through its direct effects on pH, and thus CO2 system speciation and buffer capacity. Two main charge groups were identified including carboxylic and phenolic or amine groups. Terrestrial groundwater and in-situ production within salt marsh peat contributed OrgAlk to the tidal creek, with the former being a more significant source. Groundwater entering the marsh complex contained exceptionally high OrgAlk (> 150 mu mol kg(-1)), and these compounds were preferentially preserved within the DOC pool during groundwater transport and mixing with coastal water. OrgAlk:DOC ratios in groundwater and marshinfluenced water varied across space and time. This highlights the insufficiency of using a fixed proportion of DOC to account for organic acid charge groups. Accounting for OrgAlk altered H+ concentrations by similar to 1-41 nmol kg(-1)(equivalent to a pH change of similar to 0.03-0.26), pCO(2) by similar to 30-1600 mu atm and buffer capacity by similar to 0.00-0.14 mmol kg(-1) at the relative OrgAlk contributions of 0.9-4.3% of TA observed in the marsh-influenced tidal water. Thus, OrgAlk may have a significant influence on coastal inorganic carbon cycling. Further theoretical calculations confirm that these concentrations of OrgAlk would have sizable impacts on both carbonate speciation and, ultimately, air-sea CO2 fluxes in different coastal environments, ranging from estuarine to shelf waters. A new conceptual model linking organic and inorganic carbon cycling for coastal waters is proposed to highlight the sources and sinks of organic acid charge groups, as well as their biogeochemical behaviors and mechanistic control on the CO2 system.

We investigated biogeographic patterns of elemental composition (%N, %C, and C:N ratio) of four ecologically dominant and functionally diverse marine intertidal macrophyte species (the brown algae Fucus distichus and Hedophyllum sessile, the red alga Mazzaella splendens, and the surfgrass Phyllospadix scouleri) along 900 km of coastline of the California Current System over a 10-year period. We used a nested hierarchical design to identify the dominant spatial and temporal scales of elemental composition variability and to test the sensitivity of macrophyte stoichiometry to changing ocean conditions in upwelling, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Elemental composition was highly conserved at the species level but was also sensitive to the environment, displaying marked species-dependent responses to spatial and temporal variation in ocean conditions. Moreover, the effects of local and seasonal processes were strong and with conserved species-specific differences, likely limited coherent cross-species sensitivity to climate variability from ENSO, NPGO and PDO. Unanticipated long-term steady increases in %C and bimodal increases in %N in brown algae and similar decreases in elemental composition of the red alga generated trimodal changes in C:N for these species.

Some studies suggest complications with the B/Ca proxy in photosymbiont-bearing planktonic foraminifera, while relatively few studies have investigated B/Ca in species that lack large dinoflagellate symbionts. For the first time, we use a sediment trap time series to evaluate B/Ca of subtropical and subpolar planktonic foraminifera species that are asymbiotic (Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina incompta) and a species that hosts small intrashell photosymbionts (Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). We find that B/Ca measurements across size fractions indicate overall little to no size-dependent uptake of boron that has previously been reported in some symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina incompta and N. dutertrei B/Ca are strongly correlated with calcite saturation, pH, and carbonate ion concentration, which is in good agreement with the limited number of published core top results. While G. bulloides B/Ca trends with seasonal fluctuations in carbonate chemistry, during discrete periods considerable B/Ca offsets occur when a cryptic G. bulloides species is known to be seasonally present within the region. We confirm presence and significant B/Ca offset between cryptic species by individual LA-ICP-MS analyses. This finding calls into question the use of traditional morphological classification to lump what might be genetically distinct species for geochemical analyses.

However, separating secular trends from natural variability requires NEP and NEC records across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. One promising way to make these measurements is with autonomous pH and O-2 sensors. Crucially, the accuracy of this approach relies on knowledge of the in situ ecosystem productivity quotient (Q), which indicates the moles of O-2 consumed per mole CO2 produced. Using co-located measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity, and dissolved O-2, we empirically determined Q during a three-year field campaign on Tetiaroa Atoll, French Polynesia. Empirical values of daily net Q (-1.02 <= Q(net) <= -0.47) frequently differed from both the canonical value of -1.45 for the ocean and the value of -1 often assumed for tropical reef ecosystems. Furthermore, Q changed on hourly timescales, and integrated daily values differed between days. We hypothesize that captive bubbles on the surfaces of coral, macroalgae and other substrates can explain these variations in Q, with other influential mechanisms being mixing between parcels of water, sedimentary denitrification, and ammonium-fueled primary productivity. Our findings, which are robust to changes in the model that is used to correct for advection and gas exchange, as well as changes in model parameters, suggest that future investigations of metabolism on reefs should be based on measurements of carbonate chemistry variability, rather than O-2 evolution. Otherwise, large biases in NEP and NEC could result (> 40%).",4,2019,10.1016/j.marchem.2019.103707,WOS:000500377500005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getting a better understanding of their unique biogeochemistry is a prerequisite for foreseeing their future role in salt marsh ecosystems. Using in situ microprofiling, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of O-2, pH, and CO2 in shallow salt marsh tidal ponds in the summer time. High benthic photosynthetic activity, fueled by CO2 from the sediment, resulted in steep vertical O-2 gradients at the sediment-water interface, increasing from anoxia to extremely supersaturated peak concentrations up to 886 +/- 139 mu mol L-1 (391% atmospheric O-2 saturation) over a short distance of 6 mm. These characteristic peaks developed even at low light conditions down to 150 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The oxygen gradients were restricted to the layer of benthic microalgae on the sediment surface and did not extend into the water column, which was well-mixed throughout the day showing no vertical variation. The benthic photosynthesis and respiration controlled the oxygen concentration in the water column, creating net supersaturated conditions during the day and hypoxic conditions at night. The tidal ponds were generally well-buffered showing only attenuated pH fluctuations ranging from 6.2 to 7.3, and no persistent gradients built up, despite the high photosynthetic activity at the sediment water interface. CO2 accumulated in the sediment and was present in the water column during the morning hours, but depleted in the afternoon due to the high photosynthetic uptake. Tidal ponds also experienced event-driven changes in their biogeochemistry. Sea foam developed on the water surface during the day and accumulated on one side of the pond blocking light penetration and lowering oxygen concentrations under the foam. Inundation at high tide caused a short-lived temporal variation in O-2 and pH, which was restricted to the time of the flood. As the flooding water receded, the preceding O-2 and pH conditions were immediately restored. Altogether shallow tidal ponds comprise a marsh habitat with distinctive spatiotemporal oxygen dynamics driven by benthic photosynthesis and respiration, which differ from the surrounding vegetated marsh, and could drive changes in salt marsh biogeochemistry in response to increased pond coverage.",5,2019,10.3389/fenvs.2019.00137,WOS:000496941100001,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the experimental design doesn't match with our interest, no usable data or direction"

We then examined transgenerational effects using sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus putpuratus) as our study organism. Using enclosures on the benthos, we conditioned adult sea urchins in situ at two locations - one inside the kelp forest and one outside the kelp forest. After a 11-week conditioning period timed to coincide with gametogenesis in the adults, the urchins were collected, spawned, and cultures of their progeny were raised in the laboratory in order to assess their performance to simulated ocean acidification. In terms of the physical observations, we observed significant changes in DO and pH not only when comparing sites inside and outside of the kelp forest, but also between surface and benthic sensors at the same site. DO and pH at the benthos differed in mean, the amplitude of the diel signal, and in the profile of background noise of the signal.

The results show that the pH and TA were higher and that the pCO(2) was lower in the semi-enclosed inner lagoon (IL) than on the open north shore (NS). The analyses of carbon chemistry parameters vs. dissolved oxygen and TA vs. DIC relationships reveal that the CO2 dynamics was dominated by photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) alone on the NS but by the combined effect of P/R and sedimentary anaerobic pathways in the IL. We suggest that the observed divergent behaviors in carbon chemistry between the two sites could be attributed to differences in hydrodynamic regimes. The less energetic hydrodynamics and longer residence time in the IL would be favorable for the occurrence of sedimentary anaerobic TA generation and the subsequent TA accumulation in the overlying waters. The elevated TA may lead to a pH increase and a pCO(2) decrease, thus providing a buffering effect against ocean acidification (OA) and enhancing atmospheric CO2 sequestration at local scales. The present results demonstrate that hydrodynamic regime may play an important role in regulating biogeochemical processes in seagrass meadows, and thereby modulating their capacities in OA buffering and CO2 uptaking.",8,2018,10.1016/j.ecss.2018.06.006,WOS:000439740000005,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no control is used

The only global-scale solution to ocean acidification remains rapid reduction in CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, interest in localized mitigation strategies has grown rapidly because of the recognized threat ocean acidification imposes on natural communities, including ones important to humans. Protection of seagrass meadows has been considered as a possible approach for localized mitigation of ocean acidification due to their large standing stocks of organic carbon and high productivity. Yet much work remains to constrain the magnitudes and timescales of potential buffering effects from seagrasses. We developed a biogeochemical box model to better understand the potential for a temperate seagrass meadow to locally mitigate the effects of ocean acidification. Then we parameterized the model using data from Tomales Bay, an inlet on the coast of California, USA which supports a major oyster farming industry. We conducted a series of month-long model simulations to characterize processes that occur during summer and winter. We found that average pH in the seagrass meadows was typically within 0.04 units of the pH of the primary source waters into the meadow, although we did find occasional periods (hours) when seagrass metabolism may modify the pH by up to +/- 0.2 units. Tidal phasing relative to the diel cycle modulates localized pH buffering within the seagrass meadow such that maximum buffering occurs during periods of the year with midday low tides. Our model results suggest that seagrass metabolism in Tomales Bay would not provide long-term ocean acidification mitigation. However, we emphasize that our model results may not hold in meadows where assumptions about depth-averaged net production and seawater residence time within the seagrass meadow differ from our model assumptions. Our modeling approach provides a framework that is easily adaptable to other seagrass meadows in order to evaluate the extent of their individual buffering capacities.

This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2 levels by IPCC for 2050-2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO(2) values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO(2) levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.",67,2018,10.1002/ecm.1297,WOS:000440407000003,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the experimental design doesn't match with our interest, no usable data or direction"

However, seagrass ecosystems experience extreme variability in carbonate chemistry across short temporal and small spatial scales, which could impact the pH buffering capacity of these potential refugia. Herein, short-term (hourly to diel) and small-scale (across 0.01-0.14 km(2)) spatiotemporal carbonate chemistry variability was assessed within two seagrass meadows in order to determine their short-term potential to elevate seawater pH relative to source seawater. Two locations at similar latitudes were chosen in order to compare systems dominated by coarse calcium carbonate (Bailey's Bay, Bermuda) and muddy silicate (Mission Bay, CA, USA) sediments. In both systems, spatial variability of pH across the seagrass meadow at any given time was often greater than diel variability (e.g., the average range over 24 h) at any one site, with greater spatial variability occurring at low tide in Mission Bay. Mission Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.08 +/- 0.08; diel Delta pH = 0.12 +/- 0.01; mean +/- SD) had a greater average range in both temporal and spatial seawater chemistry than Bailey's Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.02 +/- 0.01; diel Delta pH = 0.03 +/- 0.00; mean +/- SD). These differences were most likely due to a combination of slower currents, a larger tidal range, and more favorable weather conditions for photosynthesis (e.g., sunny with no rain) in Mission Bay. In both systems, there was a substantial amount of time (usually at night) when seawater pH within the seagrass beds was lower relative to the source seawater.

However, the relative importance and influence of these processes on seawater carbonate chemistry vary across multiple functional scales (defined here as space, time, and benthic community composition), and have not been fully constrained. Here, we use Bermuda as a case study to assess (1) spatiotemporal variability in physical and chemical parameters along a depth gradient at a rim reef location, (2) the spatial variability of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) over distinct benthic habitats to infer NCC:NCP ratios [< several km(2); rim reef vs. seagrass and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) sediments] on diel timescales, and (3) compare how TA-DIC relationships and NCC:NCP vary as we expand functional scales from local habitats to the entire reef platform (10's of km(2)) on seasonal to interannual timescales. Our results demonstrate that TA-DIC relationships were strongly driven by local benthic metabolism and community composition over diel cycles.

Daily changes in pH and other carbonate parameters in coastal ecosystems, associated with processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, often greatly exceed global mean predicted changes over the next century. We assessed the strength of these feedbacks under projected elevated CO2 levels by conducting a field experiment in 10 macrophyte-dominated tide pools on the coast of California, USA. We evaluated changes in carbonate parameters over time and found that under ambient conditions, daytime changes in pH, pCO(2), net ecosystem calcification (NEC), and O-2 concentrations were strongly related to rates of net community production (NCP). CO2 was added to pools during daytime low tides, which should have reduced pH and enhanced pCO(2). However, photosynthesis rapidly reduced pCO(2) and increased pH, so effects of CO 2 addition were not apparent unless we accounted for seaweed and surfgrass abundances. In the absence of macrophytes, CO2 addition caused pH to decline by similar to 0.6 units and pCO(2) to increase by similar to 487 mu atm over 6 hr during the daytime low tide. As macrophyte abundances increased, the impacts of CO2 addition declined because more CO2 was absorbed due to photosynthesis. Effects of CO2 addition were, therefore, modified by feedbacks between NCP, pH, pCO(2), and NEC.

Seaweeds are able to modify the chemical environment at their surface, in a micro-zone called the diffusive boundary layer (DBL), via their metabolic processes controlled by light intensity. Depending on the thickness of the DBL, sessile invertebrates such as calcifying bryozoans or tube-forming polychaetes living on the surface of the blades can be affected by the chemical variations occurring in this microlayer. Especially in the context of ocean acidification (OA), these microhabitats might be considered as a refuge from lower pH, because during the day photosynthesis temporarily raises the pH to values higher than in the mainstream seawater.2. We assessed the thickness and the characteristics of the DBL at two pH levels (today's average surface ocean pH 8.1 and a reduced pH predicted for the end of the century, pH 7.7) and seawater flows (slow, 0.5 and fast, > 8 cm/s) on Ecklonia radiata (kelp) blades. Oxygen and pH profiles from the blade surface to the mainstream seawater were measured with O-2 and pH microsensors for both bare blades and blades colonized by the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea.3. The DBL was thicker in slow flow compared with fast flow and the presence of bryozoans increased the DBL thickness and shaped the DBL gradient in dark conditions. Net production was increased in the low pH condition, increasing the amount of oxygen in the DBL in both bare and epiphytized blades. This increase drove the daily pH fluctuations at the blade surface, shifting them towards higher values compared with today's pH. The presence of bryozoans led to lower oxygen concentrations in the DBL and more complex pH fluctuations at the blade surface, particularly at pH 7.7.4. Overall, this study, based on microprofiles, shows that, in slow flow, DBL micro-environments at the surface of the kelps may constitute a refuge from OA with pH values higher than those of the mainstream seawater. For calcifying organisms, it could also represent training ground for harsh conditions, with broad daily pH and oxygen fluctuations.

The anthropogenic CO2 burden in the habitat was estimated for the years 1765-2100 to quantify changes in observed high-frequency carbonate chemistry dynamics. The addition of anthropogenic CO2 alters the thermodynamic buffer factors (e.g., the Revelle factor) of the carbonate system, decreasing the seagrass habitat's ability to buffer natural carbonate system fluctuations.

Mn, Cr and As were highly reactive metals while the other metals (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co and Pb) presented stable log K-D values along the estuary. Organic matter dynamic appeared to play a key role in metals fractioning. Its decomposition during water transit in the estuary induced metal desorption, especially for Cr and As.

We studied the spatial and temporal variation of the surface water pH, salinity, total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and calcite (Omega(cal)) and aragonite (Omega(cal)) saturation, in the Brunei Estuarine System (BES), Borneo, Southeast Asia. pH and salinity for tidal to seasonal timeframes were determined from data collected half-hourly, logged at three stations (upper, middle and lower estuary); these data were correlated with rainfall incidence and intensity. Carbonate parameters were calculated from TA using discrete samples collected from six stations. pH (6.8-7.9) and salinity (4.2-28.2) increased expectedly seawards, due to tidal forcing and freshwater dilution at opposite ends of the estuary; amplitudes within a tidal cycle became expanded landwards and during spring tides. While, the overall effect of heavy daily downpours on estuarine salinity and pH was muted, cumulative rainfall during the monsoon season distinctly lowered parameter baselines; the response was again more pronounced in the upper estuary. In the mid-to-upper estuary, we observed a remarkably low pH relative to salinity, extraordinary pCO(2)super-saturation (13031 +/- 4412 mu atm) and carbonate undersaturation (Omega(cal) and Omega(cal) were 0.006-1.431 and 0.004-0.928, respectively).

At a local scale however, biological activity of macrophytes may generate pH fluctuations with rates of change that are orders of magnitude larger than the long-term trend predicted for the open ocean. These fluctuations may in turn impact benthic calcifiers in the vicinity. Combining laboratory, mesocosm and field studies, such interactions between OA, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, the sea grass Zostera marina and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were investigated at spatial scales from decimetres to 100s of meters in the western Baltic. Macrophytes increased the overall mean pH of the habitat by up to 0.3 units relative to macrophyte-free, but otherwise similar, habitats and imposed diurnal pH fluctuations with amplitudes ranging from 0.3 to more than 1 pH unit. These amplitudes and their impact on mussel calcification tended to increase with increasing macrophyte biomass to bulk water ratio. At the laboratory and mesocosm scales, biogenic pH fluctuations allowed mussels to maintain calcification even under acidified conditions by shifting most of their calcification activity into the daytime when biogenic fluctuations caused by macrophyte activity offered temporal refuge from OA stress. In natural habitats with a low biomass to water body ratio, the impact of biogenic pH fluctuations on mean calcification rates of M. edulis was less pronounced. Thus, in dense algae or seagrass habitats, macrophytes may mitigate OA impact on mussel calcification by raising mean pH and providing temporal refuge from acidification stress.",51,2018,10.1002/lno.10608,WOS:000423029300001,laboratory,CI,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Norway,temperate,Europe,baltic sea,macroalgae,NA,ecological,mix,mix,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,pH,text,positive,no,pH unit,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no error associated to the values

Epibiont colonization and early post settlement stages were assessed within the FOCE setup, as part of the larger community-level study, to better understand the outcome for a multispecies assemblage and the ecological processes that result in reported community shifts under altered carbonate chemistry. Two types of artificial collectors (tiles and scourers) were placed within three treatments: a pH-manipulated enclosure, an un-manipulated control enclosure, and an open plot in the ambient meadow. Tiles and scourers were collected after one to four months. Additionally, to see whether the outcome differed for communities in a later successional stage, previously settled scourer-collectors were also placed in the same three treatments. Enclosures acted to reduce settlement and migrant colonization. Scourers deployed for one to four months within the open-plot contained a community assemblage that could be distinguished from the assemblages within the enclosures. However, a comparison of enclosure assemblages on tiles showed evidence of a pH effect. There was lowered coverage of crustose coralline algae and fewer calcareous tube-forming polychaetes (Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus sp.) on tiles placed in the pH-manipulated enclosure compared to the un-manipulated enclosure.

Moreover, it seems that Ni concentration increases during soil evolution, being probably related to the degradation of serpentine. Instead, the water-soluble Ni measured in the leaching tests is greater in soils recently reclaimed compared to the oldest soils. Soil properties of two soil profiles from a reclaimed wetland area were examined to determine soil evolution over one century.

To forecast the functioning of coastal seagrass ecosystems in acidified oceans, more knowledge on the long-term adaptive capacities of seagrass species and their epibionts is needed. Therefore we studied morphological characteristics of Posidonia oceanica and the structure of its epibiont communities at a Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vent off Panarea Island (Italy) and performed a laboratory experiment to test the effect of OA on P. oceanica photosynthesis and its potential buffering capacity. At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet, venting of CO2 gas was controlled by tides, resulting in an average pH difference of 0.1 between the vent and reference site. P. oceanica shoot and leaf density was unaffected by these levels of OA, although shorter leaves at the vent site suggest increased susceptibility to erosion, potentially by herbivores. The community of sessile epibionts differed in composition and was characterized by a higher species richness at the vent site, though net epiphytic calcium carbonate concentration was similar. These findings suggest a higher ecosystem complexity at the vent site, which may have facilitated the higher diversity of copepods in the otherwise unaffected motile epibiont community. In the laboratory experiment, P. oceanica photosynthesis increased with decreasing pH(T) (7.6, 6.6, 5.5), which induced an elevated pH at the leaf surfaces of up to 0.5 units compared to the ambient seawater pH(T) of 6.6. This suggests a temporary pH buffering in the diffusive boundary layer of leaves, which could be favorable for epibiont organisms. The results of this multispecies study contribute to understanding community-level responses and underlying processes in long-term acidified conditions.

Macrocystis pyrifera can acquire and utilize both CO2 and bicarbonate (HCO3-) as Ci substrates for photosynthesis and growth. Given the variability in carbon delivery (due to current velocities and varying [DIC]) and demand (in the form of saturating irradiance), we hypothesized that the proportion of CO2 and bicarbonate utilized is not constant for M. pyrifera, but a variable function of their fluctuating environment. We further hypothesized that populations acclimated to different wave exposure and irradiance habitats would display different patterns of bicarbonate uptake. To test these hypotheses, we carried out oxygen evolution trials in the laboratory to measure the proportion of bicarbonate utilized by M. pyrifera via external CA under an orthogonal cross of velocity, irradiance, and acclimation treatments. Our Monterey Bay populations of M. pyrifera exhibited proportionally higher external bicarbonate utilization in high irradiance and high flow velocity conditions than in sub-saturating irradiance or low flow velocity conditions.

Despite the strong imprint of advection on the biogeochemical variability of the kelp forest, surface waters were undersaturated with CO2 in the spring through fall, indicative of the strong role of photosynthesis on biogeochemical variability.

Biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds have the capacity to reduce CO2 concentration and potentially provide refugia from OA. Further, some seagrasses have been shown to increase their photosynthetic rate in response to enriched total CO2 (TCO2). Therefore, the ability of seagrass to mitigate OA may increase as concentrations of TCO2 increase. In this study, we exposed native Zostera marina and non-native Zostera japonica seagrasses from Padilla Bay, WA (USA) to various levels of irradiance and TCO2. Our results indicate that the average maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) for Z japonica as a function of irradiance and TCO2 was 3x greater than Z. marina when standardized to chlorophyll (360 +/- 33 pmol TCO2 mg chl(-1) h(-1) and 113 +/- 10 mu mol TCO2 mg chl(-1) h(-1), respectively). Additionally, Z. japonica increased its P-max similar to 50% when TCO2 increased from similar to 1,770 to 2,051 mu mol TCO2 kg(-1). In contrast, Z. marina did not display an increase in P-max with higher TCO2, possibly due to the variance of photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance within TCO2 treatments (coefficient of variation: 30-60%) relative to the range of TCO2 tested. Our results suggest that Z japonica can affect the OA mitigation potential of seagrass beds, and its contribution may increase relative to Z. marina as oceanic TCO2 rises. Further, we extended our empirical results to incorporate various biomass to water volume ratios in order to conceptualize how these additional attributes affect changes in carbonate chemistry. Estimates show that the change in TCO2 via photosynthetic carbon uptake as modeled in this study can produce positive diurnal changes in pH and aragonite saturation state that are on the same order of magnitude as those estimated for whole seagrass systems. Based on our results, we predict that seagrasses Z. marina and Z. japonica both have the potential to produce short-term changes in carbonate chemistry, thus offsetting anthropogenic acidification when irradiance is saturating.",2,2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.00228,WOS:000457690600226,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no control used

Our results indicate that relative to present-day conditions, successful germling production was reduced fourfold under elevated temperature alone, and fivefold under combined elevated temperature and pCO(2) (i.e. future conditions''). Similarly, survival and growth of male and female gametophytes were lower under elevated temperature alone than under either present-day, elevated pCO(2) alone, or future conditions. Gametophyte sex ratios skewed slightly toward males across all treatments. Sporophyte recruitment and growth were greatest and occurred earliest under elevated pCO(2) alone, but were delayed under elevated temperature alone.

The study uses a comprehensive approach by combining tidal water sampling of CO2 parameters across seasons, continuous in situ measurements of biogeochemically-relevant parameters and water fluxes, with high-resolution modeling in an intertidal salt marsh of the U.S. northeast region. Salt marshes can acidify and alkalize tidal water by injecting CO2 (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). DIC and TA generation may also be decoupled due to differential effects of marsh aerobic and anaerobic respiration on DIC and TA. As marsh DIC is added to tidal water, the buffering capacity first decreases to a minimum and then increases quickly. Large additions of marsh DIC can result in higher buffering capacity in ebbing tide than incoming tide. Alkalization of tidal water, which mostly occurs in the summer due to anaerobic respiration, can further modify buffering capacity. Marsh exports of DIC and alkalinity may have complex implications for the future, more acidified ocean. Marsh DIC export exhibits high variability over tidal and seasonal cycles, which is modulated by both marsh DIC generation and by water fluxes. The marsh DIC export of 414 g C m(-2) yr(-1), based on high-resolution measurements and modeling, is more than twice the previous estimates.

Of this, 57Gt (65%) are stored in Indonesian peatlands. Large-scale exploitation of land, including deforestation and drainage for the establishment of oil palm plantations, is changing the carbon balance of Indonesian peatlands, turning them from a natural sink to a source via outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere and leakage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the coastal ocean. The impacts of this perturbation to the coastal environment and at the global scale are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate the downstream effects of released Indonesian peat carbon on coastal ecosystems and on the global carbon cycle. We use a biogeochemical box model in combination with novel and literature observations to investigate the impact of different carbon emission scenarios on the combined ocean-atmosphere system. The release of all carbon stored in the Indonesian peat pool, considered as a worst-case scenario, will increase atmospheric pCO(2) by 8ppm to 15ppm within the next 200years. The expected impact on the Java Sea ecosystems is most significant on the short term (over a few hundred years) and is characterized by an increase of 3.3% in phytoplankton, 32% in seagrass biomass, and 5% decrease in coral biomass. On the long term, however, the coastal ecosystems will recover to reach near pre-excursion conditions. Our results suggest that the ultimate fate of the peat carbon is in the deep ocean with 69% of it landing in the deep DIC pool after 1000years, but the effects on the global ocean carbonate chemistry will be marginal.",19,2016,10.1111/gcb.13108,WOS:000367982900026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct diel and seasonal fluctuations were observed at daily and monthly timescales respectively, indicating the influence of photosynthetic and respiratory processes on the local carbonate chemistry.

There is a suggestion that photosynthetic organisms could mitigate ocean acidification on a local scale, through seagrass protection or seaweed cultivation, as net ecosystem organic production raises the saturation state of calcium carbonate making seawater less corrosive. Here, we used a natural gradient in calcium carbonate saturation, caused by shallow-water CO2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea, to assess whether seaweed that is resistant to acidification (Padina pavonica) could prevent adverse effects of acidification on epiphytic foraminifera. We found a reduction in the number of species of foraminifera as calcium carbonate saturation state fell and that the assemblage shifted from one dominated by calcareous species at reference sites (pH similar to 8.19) to one dominated by agglutinated foraminifera at elevated levels of CO2 (pH similar to 7.71). It is expected that ocean acidification will result in changes in foraminiferal assemblage composition and agglutinated forms may become more prevalent. Although Padina did not prevent adverse effects of ocean acidification, high biomass stands of seagrass or seaweed farms might be more successful in protecting epiphytic foraminifera.",24,2015,10.1002/ece3.1475,WOS:000354209800003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially the ability of seagrasses to aerate their below-ground tissue and immediate rhizosphere to prevent sulfide intrusion from the surrounding sediment is critical for their resilience to environmental disturbance. There is a need for chemical techniques that can map the O-2 distribution and dynamics in the seagrass rhizosphere upon environmental changes and thereby identify critical stress thresholds of e.g. water flow, turbidity, and O-2 conditions in the water phase. In a novel experimental approach, we incorporated optical O-2 sensor nanoparticles into a transparent artificial sediment matrix consisting of pH-buffered deoxygenated sulfidic agar. Seagrass growth and photosynthesis was not inhibited in the experimental setup when the below-ground biomass was immobilized in the artificial sulfidic sediment with nanoparticles and showed root growth rates (similar to 5 mm day(-1)) and photosynthetic quantum yields (similar to 0.7) comparable to healthy seagrasses in their natural habitat. We mapped the real-time below ground O-2 distribution and dynamics in the whole seagrass rhizosphere during experimental manipulation of light exposure and O-2 content in the overlaying water. Those manipulations showed that oxygen release from the belowground tissue is much higher in light as compared to darkness and that water column hypoxia leads to diminished oxygen levels around the rhizome/roots. Oxygen release was visualized and analyzed on a whole rhizosphere level, which is a substantial improvement to existing methods relying on point measurements with O-2 microsensors or partial mapping of the rhizosphere in close contact with a planar O-2 optode. The combined use of optical nanoparticle-based sensors with artificial sediments enables imaging of chemical microenvironments in the rhizosphere of aquatic plants at high spatiotemporal resolution with a relatively simple experimental setup and thus represents a significant methodological advancement for studies of environmental impacts on aquatic plant ecophysiology.",50,2015,10.1021/es505734b,WOS:000349806400039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and temperature lead to changes of about 0.3-0.5 pH units throughout a year. Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment, induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units.In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment, or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full impacts of ocean acidification on an organism scale, although this might be at a cost to the individual. Furthermore, in some areas, calcifiers may potentially benefit from changes to ambient seawater pH, where photosynthetic organisms drawdown CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In high-latitude coastal waters the regulation of pH and Omega(arag) is, however, far more complex than offshore because increased biological activity and input of glacial meltwater affect pH. Effects of ocean acidification on calcifiers and non-calcifying phototrophs occupying coastal habitats cannot be derived from extrapolation of current and forecasted offshore conditions, but they require an understanding of the regimes of pH and Omega(arag) in their coastal habitats. To increase knowledge of the natural variability in pH in the Arctic coastal zone and specifically to test the influence of benthic vegetated habitats, we quantified pH variability in a Greenland fjord in a nested-scale approach. A sensor array logging pH, O-2, PAR, temperature and salinity was applied on spatial scales ranging from kilometre scale across the horizontal extension of the fjord; to 100m scale vertically in the fjord, 10-100m scale between subtidal habitats with and without kelp forests and between vegetated tidal pools and adjacent vegetated shores; and to centimetre to metre scale within kelp forests and millimetre scale across diffusive boundary layers of macrophyte tissue. In addition, we assessed the temporal variability in pH on diurnal and seasonal scales. Based on pH measurements combined with point samples of total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon and relationships to salinity, we also estimated variability in Omega(arag). Results show variability in pH and Omega(arag) of up to 0.2-0.3 units at several scales, i.e. along the horizontal and vertical extension of the fjord, between seasons and on a diel basis in benthic habitats and within 1 m(3) of kelp forest. Vegetated intertidal pools exhibited extreme diel pH variability of >1.5 units and macrophyte diffusive boundary layers a pH range of up to 0.8 units. Overall, pelagic and benthic metabolism was an important driver of pH and Omega(arag) producing mosaics of variability from low levels in the dark to peak levels at high irradiance generally appearing favourable for calcification. We suggest that productive coastal environments may form niches of high pH in a future acidified Arctic Ocean.",29,2015,10.5194/bg-12-4895-2015,WOS:000360294800003,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no error associated to the values, average pH is not available"

Understanding the ecological consequences of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will require examination of how calcifying organisms and their associated communities respond to natural variation in CO2 concentration. Many macroalgae may respond positively or neutrally to ocean acidification, but calcifying species such as coralline algae are predicted to be some of the most susceptible organisms to changing CO2. Here I test the impacts of temperature and pH variation on important photosynthetic metrics of macroalgal assemblages composed of coralline turf, Corallina vancouveriensis and the associated canopy-forming kelp, Saccharina sessilis using in situ photorespirometry and laboratory mesocosms. In situ photorespirometry was done at two locations on the Oregon (USA) coast, an area with variable upwelling of high CO2, low pH water. To complement in situ measurements, a series of laboratory mesocosms were used to disentangle the effects of pH and temperature on photosynthetic parameters across a light gradient The acute effects of low pH were also tested across a temperature gradient, revealing an exacerbated effect of short duration, low pH events on respiration rates at increasing temperature. NPP (net primary productivity) was reduced by 10-20% within in situ coralline assemblages across a natural gradient of pH (8.1-7.9), but there was a mostly neutral effect of low pH on NPP of coralline-kelp assemblages. These results indicate varied responses of coralline and coralline-kelp assemblages to temperature and pH gradients, but under limiting light conditions primary production and growth of corallines are likely to decrease under modest scenarios of CO2 increase. Assemblage composition could play an important role in modulating the impacts of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, and results from this study suggest that canopy and sub-canopy interactions could determine the response of susceptible species to changing climatic parameters.

We observed diel pH changes in shallow (5-12 m) seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows spanning 0.06 pH units in September to 0.24 units in June. The carbonate system (pH, DIC, and aragonite saturation state (Omega(Ar))) and O-2 within the meadows displayed strong diel variability driven by primary productivity, and changes in chemistry were related to structural parameters of the meadow, in particular, the leaf surface area available for photosynthesis (LAI). LAI was positively correlated to mean, max and range pH(NBS) and max and range Omega(Ar). In June, vertical mixing (as Turbulent Kinetic Energy) influenced max and min Omega(Ar), while in September there was no effect of hydrodynamics on the carbonate system within the canopy. Max and range Omega(Ar) within the meadow showed a positive trend with the calcium carbonate load of the leaves, pointing to a possible link between structural parameters, Omega(Ar) and carbonate deposition.Calcifying organisms, e. g. epiphytes with carbonate skeletons, may benefit from the modification of the carbonate system by the meadow. There is, however, concern for the ability of seagrasses to provide modifications of similar importance in the future. The predicted decline of seagrass meadows may alter the scope for alteration of pH within a seagrass meadow and in the water column above the meadow, particularly if shoot density and biomass decline, on which LAI is based.

In the second treatment, pH was manipulated around the mean (as a step-function), 0.4 pH units higher during daylight and 0.4 units lower during darkness to approximate diurnal fluctuations in a kelp forest. In all cases, growth rates were lower at a reduced mean pH, and fluctuations in pH acted additively to further reduce growth.

The coastal ocean is expected to experience periods of even lower carbonate saturation state because of the inherent natural variability of coastal habitats. Thus, in order to accurately project the impact of OA on the coastal ocean, we must first understand its natural variability. The production of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine algae and the release of DMSP's breakdown product dimethylsulphide (DMS) are often related to environmental stress. This study investigated the spatiotemporal response of tropical macroalgae (Padina sp., Amphiroa sp. and Turbinaria sp.) and the overlying water column to natural changes in reefal carbonate chemistry. We compared macroalgal intracellular DMSP and water column DMSP+DMS concentrations between the environmentally stable reef crest and environmentally variable reef flat of the fringing Suleman Reef, Egypt, over 45-hour sampling periods. Similar diel patterns were observed throughout: maximum intracellular DMSP and water column DMS/P concentrations were observed at night, coinciding with the time of lowest carbonate saturation state. Spatially, water column DMS/P concentrations were highest over areas dominated by seagrass and macroalgae (dissolved DMS/P) and phytoplankton (particulate DMS/P) rather than corals. This research suggests that macroalgae may use DMSP to maintain metabolic function during periods of low carbonate saturation state. In the reef system, seagrass and macroalgae may be more important benthic producers of dissolved DMS/P than corals. An increase in DMS/P concentrations during periods of low carbonate saturation state may become ecologically important in the future under an OA regime, impacting larval settlement and increasing atmospheric emissions of DMS.",16,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0064651,WOS:000319733000073,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of drought on coastal wetlands remains unclear because the hydrology of these wetlands is strongly influenced by regular tidal inundation. In order to test the links between hydrologic variability and changes to marsh groundwater conditions that may be stressful to the salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora, we installed piezometers and passive diffusion samplers in a salt marsh island at North Inlet, South Carolina, where AMD was observed in fall 2001. Significant variations in tidal inundation, rainfall, evapo-transpiration, groundwater dynamics, and porewater chemistry were observed. The island was typically inundated twice daily, but there were occasional 19-21 h periods in winter and spring when the marsh was not inundated and a singular event when the marsh was not inundated for three days (March 2008). Enhanced exposure resulted in seasonal redox chemistry changes, as indicated by changes in the ratio of ferrous iron [Fe(II)] to total iron [Fe(II) + Fe(III)], but our observations do not support redox and pH changes as the cause of AMD at this site. Porewater salinity varied from 14 to 40 in the upper 1 m of the marsh. Salinity was most variable near the surface and increased with depth, reflecting root zone transpiration and downward movement of porewater through the marsh mud into the underlying confined sand aquifer. Pearson Correlation tests among porewater constituents and hydrologic parameters indicated significant associations between porewater salinity, tidal inundation, rainfall, and ET, and additional associations between porewater iron concentration, speciation, and tidal inundation. Linear regression model estimates of porewater salinity for 2001-2002 did not indicate the development of hypersalinity during that period. However, these estimates did predict a dramatic increase in salinity that coincided with the beginning of drought conditions just prior to the observation of AMD, suggesting this as a cause for AMD at this site. Drought is predicted to increase over the next century; damage caused by potential increases in the frequency of drought-related AMD may limit the ability of intertidal salt marshes to accommodate sea level rise.

Natural CO2, alkalinity, and salinity gradients can significantly alter local carbonate chemistry, and thereby create a range of susceptibility for different ecosystems to OA. As such, there is a need to characterize this natural variability of seawater carbonate chemistry, especially within coastal ecosystems. Since 2009, carbonate chemistry data have been collected on the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). During periods of heightened productivity, there is a net uptake of total CO2 (TCO2) which increases aragonite saturation state (Omega(arag)) values on inshore patch reefs of the upper FRT. These waters can exhibit greater Omega(arag) than what has been modeled for the tropical surface ocean during preindustrial times, with mean (+/- std. error) Omega(arag)-values in spring = 4.69 (+/- 0.101). Conversely, Omega(arag)-values on offshore reefs generally represent oceanic carbonate chemistries consistent with present day tropical surface ocean conditions. This gradient is opposite from what has been reported for other reef environments. We hypothesize this pattern is caused by the photosynthetic uptake of TCO2 mainly by seagrasses and, to a lesser extent, macroalgae in the inshore waters of the FRT. These inshore reef habitats are therefore potential acidification refugia that are defined not only in a spatial sense, but also in time; coinciding with seasonal productivity dynamics.

In this study, the effect of seagrass productivity on seawater carbonate chemistry and coral calcification was modelled on the basis of an analysis of published data.Published data (11 studies, 64 records) reveal that seagrass meadows in the Indo-Pacific have an 83% chance of being net autotrophic, resulting in an average net sink of 155 gC m(-2) yr(-1). The capacities for seagrass productivity were analysed using an empirical model to examine the effect on seawater carbonate chemistry. Our analyses indicate that increases in pH of up to 0.38 units, and Omega(arag) increases of 2.9 are possible in the presence of seagrass meadows (compared to their absence) with the precise values of these increases dependent on water residence time (tidal flushing) and water depth. In shallow water reef environments, Scleractinian coral calcification downstream of seagrass has the potential to be approximate to 18% greater than in an environment without seagrass. If this potential benefit to reef calcifiers is supported by further study it offers a potential tool in marine park management at a local scale. The applicability of this will depend upon local physical conditions as well as the spatial configuration of habitats, and the factors that influence their productivity.

In temperate coastal seas, seaweeds are dominant primary producers that create complex habitats and supply energy to higher trophic levels. Studies on OA and macroalgae have focused on calcifying species and adult stages, but critically, they have overlooked the microscopic stages of the reproductive life cycle, which, for other anthropogenic stressors, e.g., UV-B radiation, are the most susceptible life-history phase. Also, environmental cues and stressors can cause changes in the sex ratio, which has implications for the mating system and recruitment success. Here, we report the effects of pH (7.598.50) on meiospore germination and sex determination for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (Laminariales), in the presence and absence of additional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Lowered pH (7.597.60, using HCl-only) caused a significant reduction in germination, whereas added DIC had the opposite effect, indicating that increased CO2 at lower pH ameliorates physiological stress. This finding also highlights the importance of appropriate manipulation of seawater carbonate chemistry when testing the effects of OA on photosynthetic organisms. The proportion of male to female gametophytes did not vary significantly between treatments, suggesting that pH was not a primary environmental modulator of sex. Relative to the baseline (pH 8.19), gametophytes were 32% larger under moderate OA (pH 7.86) and 10% larger under extreme OA (pH 7.61). We suggest that metabolically active cells can compensate for the acidification of seawater. This homeostatic function minimizes the negative effects of lower pH (high H+ ions) on cellular activity. The 69% reduction in germination success under extreme OA suggests that meiospores of M. pyrifera may be resistant to future OA.",84,2012,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02594.x,WOS:000300671600005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DO and pH were strongly, positively correlated, revealing that organisms on this upwelling shelf are not only exposed to low pH but also to low DO. The dominant scale of temporal DO and pH variability occurred on semi-diurnal, diurnal and event (days-weeks) time scales. Daily ranges in DO and pH at 7 m water depth (13 mab) could be as large as 220 mu mol kg(-1) and 0.36 units, respectively. Sources of pH and DO variation include photosynthesis within the kelp forest ecosystem, which can elevate DO and pH by up to 60 mu mol kg(-1) and 0.1 units over one week following the intrusion of high-density, nutrient-rich water. Accordingly, highly productive macrophyte-based ecosystems could serve as deoxygenation and acidification refugia by acting to elevate DO and pH relative to surrounding waters. DO and pH exhibited greater spatial variation over a 10 m increase in water depth (from 7 to 17 m) than along a 5 km stretch of shelf in a cross-shore or alongshore direction. Over a three-month time period, mean DO and pH at 17 m water depth were 168 mu mol kg(-1) and 7.87, respectively. These values represent a 35% decrease in mean DO and 37% increase in [H+] relative to near-surface waters. High-frequency variation was also reduced at depth. The mean daily range in DO and pH was 39% and 37% less, respectively, at 17m water depth relative to 7 m. As a consequence, the exposure history of an organism is largely a function of its depth of occurrence within the kelp forest. With knowledge of local alkalinity conditions and high-frequency temperature, salinity, and pH data, we estimated pCO(2) and calcium carbonate saturation states with respect to calcite and aragonite (Omega(calc) and Omega(arag)) for the La Jolla kelp forest at 7 m and 17 m water depth. pCO(2) ranged from 246 to 1016 mu atm, Omega(calc) was always supersaturated, and Omega(arag) was undersaturated at the beginning of March for five days when pH was less than 7.75 and DO was less than 115 mu mol kg(-1). These findings raise the possibility that the benthic communities along eastern boundary current systems are currently acclimatized and adapted to natural, variable, and low DO and pH. Still, future exposure of coastal California populations to even lower DO and pH may increase as upwelling intensifies and hypoxic boundaries shoal, compressing habitats and challenging the physiological capacity of intolerant species.",132,2012,10.5194/bg-9-3917-2012,WOS:000310471800014,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,control are in the kelp forest

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO(2), reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO2. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with a priori expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA.

The Beaver Creek Wetlands Complex consists of dozens of marshes and ponds built in a former Licking River flood-plain, in the hills of east Kentucky, USA. In natural wetland ecosystems, aquatic primary production is highest in emergent and submerged vegetations zones; where daybreak dissolved oxygen (DO) is often near zero, and DO may rise to well over 100% saturation past mid-day. Open-water areas, dominated by phytoplankton, have less dramatic diel DO fluctuations-often without pre-dawn anoxia. Compared to open water, temperatures fluctuate less dramatically in vascular vegetation, due to shading and suppression of wind and waves. Measurements of ecosystem metabolism (diel changes in DO and pH) in three aquatic habitats of the constructed wetlands (emergent vegetation, submerged vegetation, open water) were compared to these natural ideals. In Beaver Creek Wetlands, water temperature patterns were not as dramatic as in natural habitats, nor did they did follow a similar trend. Waters in emergent vegetation (29.5 degrees C) were warmest; submerged vegetation coolest (26.5 degrees C); open-water intermediate (27.4 degrees C). Diel DO and pH patterns were not similar to natural habitats. Highest net primary production (NPP) and gross primary production (GPP) were measured in emergent vegetation waters (mean GPP= 7.58 g m(-2) d(-1)); lowest in submerged vegetation (mean GPP = 5.48 g m(-2) d(-1)); and intermediate in open-water (mean GPP= 6.95 g m(-2) d(-1)). Diel pH changes were greatest in the highly productive emergent waters (median maximum daily difference of 0.36), and not as pronounced in submerged vegetation and open-water (median maximum change = 0.16 and 0.22, respectively). Water-column respiration was generally about double NPP. Like natural ecosystems, near anoxic DO concentrations were consistently measured in emergent and submerged plants before dawn; whereas open-water zones were generally >4 mg l(-1).

L.",Tidally driven water column hydro-geochemistry in a remediating acidic wetland,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,"Managed tidal inundation is a newly evolved technique for remediating coastal acid sulphate soil (CASS) wetlands. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the hydro-geochemical pathways and spatiotemporal dynamics of residual H+ and metal(loid) mobilisation into the tidal fringe surface waters of these uniquely iron-rich landscapes. Here, we examine the hydrology and water column chemistry across the intertidal slope of a remediating CASS wetland during several tide cycles. There was extreme spatial and temporal dynamism in water column chemistry, with pH fluctuating by similar to 3 units (similar to 3.5-6.5) during a single tide cycle. Acute acidity was spatially confined to the upper intertidal slope, reflecting surface sediment properties, and tidal overtopping is an important pathway for mobilisation of residual H+ and Al3+ to the water column. Marine derived HCO3- was depleted from surface waters migrating across the intertidal slope and a strong gradient in HCO3- was observed from the tidal fringe to the adjacent tributary channel and nearby estuary. Tidal forcing generated oscillating hydraulic gradients in the shallow fringing aquifer, favouring ebb-tide seepage and driving rapid, heterogeneous advection of groundwater on the lower intertidal slope via surface connected macropores. A combination of diffusive and advective flux across the sediment-water interface led to persistent, elevated surface water Fe2+ (similar to 10-1000 mu M). The geochemical processes associated with Fe2+ mobilisation displayed distinct spatial zonation, with low pH, proton-promoted desorption occurring on the upper intertidal slope, whilst circum-neutral pH, Fe(III)-reducing processes dominated the lower intertidal slope. Arsenic was also mobilised into surface waters on the lower intertidal slope under moderate pH (similar to 6.0) conditions and was strongly positively correlated with Fe2+. Saturation index values for aragonite were substantially depressed (-1 to -5) and significantly negatively correlated with elevation, thereby presenting a barrier to re-colonisation of the upper intertidal slope by calcifying benthic organisms. These findings highlight the spatially complex hydrological and geochemical controls on surface water quality that can occur in tidally inundated acid sulphate soil environments.

Each of these features could potentially influence acid-base regulation during respiratory acidosis either by facilitating or constraining HCO3 (-) accumulation, respectively. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the capacity of P. notatus to regulate blood acid-base status during exposure to increasing levels of hypercapnia (nominally 1-5% CO2). Fish exhibited a well-developed ability to increase plasma HCO3 (-) levels with values of 39.8 +/- A 2.8 mmol l(-1) being achieved at the most severe stage of hypercapnic exposure (arterial blood PCO2 = 21.9 +/- A 1.7 mmHg). Consequently, blood pH, while lowered by 0.15 units (pH = 7.63 +/- A 0.06) during the final step of hypercapnia, was regulated far above values predicted by chemical buffering (predicted pH = 7.0). The accumulation of plasma HCO3 (-) during hypercapnia was associated with marked increases in branchial net acid excretion (J H-NET(+)) owing exclusively to increases in the titratable alkalinity component; total ammonia excretion was actually reduced during hypercapnia. The increase in J H-NET(+) was accompanied by increases in branchial carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymatic activity (2.8x) and CA protein levels (1.6x); branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity was unaffected. Rectal fluids sampled from control fish contained on average HCO3 (-) concentrations of 92.2 +/- A 4.8 mmol l(-1). At the highest level of hypercapnia, rectal fluid HCO3 (-) levels were increased significantly to 141.8 +/- A 7.4 mmol l(-1) but returned to control levels during post-hypercapnia recovery (96.0 +/- A 13.2 mmol l(-1)). Thus, the impressive accumulation of plasma HCO3 (-) to compensate for hypercapnic acidosis occurred against a backdrop of increasing intestinal HCO3 (-) excretion. Based on in vitro measurements of intestinal base secretion in Ussing chambers, it would appear that P. notatus did not respond by minimizing base loss during hypercapnia; the increases in base flux across the intestinal epithelium in response to alterations in serosal HCO3 (-) concentration were similar in preparations obtained from control or hypercapnic fish. Fish returned to normocapnia developed profound metabolic alkalosis owing to unusually slow clearance of the accumulated plasma HCO3 (-). The apparent inability of P. notatus to effectively excrete HCO3 (-) following hypercapnia may reflect its aglomerular (i.e., non-filtering) kidney coupled with the normally low rates of urine production in marine teleosts.",31,2010,10.1007/s00360-010-0492-8,WOS:000283139900010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sediment P compounds, pH and Eh were analysed over depth along five transects of two areas in the Saigon River Delta and compared with leaf P levels. A three-dimensional spatial approach was used to investigate pH and Eh effects on P compound distribution at different sediment depth and locate layers of predominant P uptake. Along an inundation gradient, submergence durations of 254 to 2 days per year caused a large Eh gradient within the top 20 cm, whereas Eh response was small within 20-45 cm depth. At individual layers, a correlation between Eh and Al/Fe-P was only found in the upper depth interval (0-20 cm). No significant effect of Eh or Al/Fe-P on Morgan-P (available P) was detected. Minor effects on P composition changes by the Eh were caused through generally strongly reduced sediment at deeper layers (> 20 cm). In contrast, pH variations produced extreme differences in both, Ca-P and available P content at layers of apparently predominant P uptake (> 20 cm). As available P was correlated with Ca-P (p < 0.001), leaf P (p < 0.001) and pH (non linear correlation) it is likely that the pH sensitive Ca-P fraction is a more effective source for mangrove tree growth than Al/Fe-P.

The explanation of this apparent discrepancy was shown to be the high biological sulfide oxidizing capacity in combination with a high chemical buffering capacity.The data presented illustrate that the buffering capacity of sediments towards free sulfide is the combined result of the chemical and biological processes. The ratio between these were found to depend on the degree of eutrophication. It was shown that the chemical buffering capacity towards sulfide is severely overestimated when based on the pool of chemically reactive iron, a more realistic value is obtained by estimating the total amount of sulfide that can be added before free sulfide can be detected. A clear difference was observed between the numbers of colorless sulfur bacteria and the activity of the entire population.

A fine-scale porewater profile of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) is calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data and is in good agreement with coarse-scale TCO2 profiles measured in squeezed porewater. The measuring uncertainty for TCO2 is within 5%. The measurements of the pH microelectrode also agree in general with those of a glass mini-electrode. The mini-electrode, however, measures smaller pH changes as a result of mixing the sediments.Very low pH values (< 6.0) are measured in this salt marsh-influenced sediment and are correlated to the oxidation of Mn2+, Fe2+, and possibly, solid sulfides. Concentration profiles and fluxes of TCO2, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- are calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data. These millimeter-scale profiles demonstrate that the calculation of benthic flux of TCO2 based on porewater TCO2 profiles and on a HCO3- (or a concentration weighted) diffusion coefficient can be erroneous. When porewater pH is very low(< 7.0) in the near-surface sediment, as is the case in many organic-rich coastal sediments, TCO2 transport is accomplished significantly through the diffusion of CO2 and can be greatly enhanced due to a sharp concentration gradient and a large diffusion coefficient of CO2.

Phosphate and;iron mobility were measured in the water and sediment phosphate was fractionated. Under oxic conditions, pH variations changed the distribution of phosphate in the sediment. At pH = 6, a calcium bound phosphate mobilization was Found by the dissolution of this fraction, while the liberate phosphate became iron-bound. A part of phosphate adsorbed onto the iron hydroxides was transferred to organic fractions when pH changed from 7 to 8. Under anoxic conditions, iron hydroxides are responsible for some release of phosphate. The redox potential necessary to obtain this release decreased with an increase in pH: release occurred at pH 7 and -50 mV, at pH 8 and -100 mV and at pH 9 and -150 mV. Oxic conditions induced phosphate uptake from sediments. Such oxic conditions can be restored quickly in the sediments after an anoxic period. In contrast, restoration of anoxic conditions is slow.Thus, decreasing phosphate inputs can induce sediment phosphate release into the water under appropriate redox and pH conditions.

In addition, data on the chemical and biological buffering capacity towards free sulphide were collected in sediment slurries from defined depth layers using a biological sulphide and oxygen monitor (BOSM) equipped with electrodes for oxygen, sulphide, redox and pH. The data showed that a substantial population of aerobic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria was present, yet buffering towards free sulphide could mainly be attributed to chemical processes: in particular, reactions with iron were of importance. Interestingly, the potential microbiological rate of sulphide oxidation was orders of magnitude higher than the rate of sulphate reduction reported for this ecosystem.The ecological implications of these observations for the Bassin d'Arcachon are that the powerful biological buffering capacity towards the free sulphide present will become effective after the chemical buffering capacity has been depleted.

The relationship between pH(i) and pH(o) was steep, with slopes varying between 0.8 and 1.2. Similarly, varying pH(o) by changing Pco(2) at constant [HCO3-](o) or changing [HCO3-](o) at constant PCO2 led to rapid, monotonic changes in pH(i). The relationship between pH(i) and pH(o) was once again steep, with slopes varying between 0.8 and 1.2. However, simultaneous changes in Pco(2) and [HCO3-](o) at constant pH(o) did not cause any significant changes in steady-state pH(i). In imaging studies, single, isolated TRCs responded to changes in pH(i), with parallel changes in pH(i) in the soma and apical process. In addition, changes in pH(o) induced parallel changes in pH(i) throughout TBFs. These data suggest that the steady-state TRC pH(i) is a function of pH(o). Changes in TRC pH(i) may be involved in acid sensing, and salivary [HCO3-] may play a role in the maintainance of steady-state TRC pH(i) and in the neutralization of acid-induced changes in pH(i).",28,1997,,WOS:A1997XV71000027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lampreys and teleost fish, haemoglobins have low buffering capacities and large Bohr/Haldane effects, Na+/H+ exchange plays an important role in the control of haemoglobin oxygen-affinity in these vertebrate groups. The large Bohr/Haldane effect also facilitates carbon dioxide transport: the blood (or erythrocyte) pH increases upon deoxygenation, thus increasing the concentration of bicarbonate formed at a given carbon dioxide tension, In lampreys, the bicarbonate permeability of the erythrocyte membrane is low, As a consequence, extracellular acid loads cannot be buffered by haemoglobin, In contrast, teleost erythrocytes possess a functional anion exchange, allowing extracellular proton loads to be buffered by haemoglobin, However, because the buffering capacity of teleost haemoglobins is low, buffering of extracellular acid loads is less effective in teleost fish than in elasmobranch fish and in air-breathing vertebrates whose haemoglobins have a high buffering capacity, However, the high buffering capacity of the haemoglobins diminishes the possibility of regulating haemoglobin oxygen-affinity via secondarily active Na+/H+ exchange, because intracellular pH changes, caused by proton efflux, remain small.",76,1997,,WOS:A1997WH71900020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, studies on the technology of tissue culture oi mangrove are found only in a few reports. Furthermore, mangrove has the trait of halo-tolerance different from other terrestrial higher plants because it grows in areas of brackish water. Therefore, the breeding of halo-tolerant varieties should be possible, when introduced to other higher plants by technologies of mass production of plant bodies having this trait, cell fusion, and so forth become possible.First, the conditions of protoplast preparation from the mesophyll of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk., in the family Rhizophoraceae among mangrove tree species were examined. Under the conditions for the preparation using many single isolates of protoplasts, the juvenile tissues of mesophylls were used as follows. Enzymes of 2% Acremoniumcellulase, 0.5% Macerozyme R-10, 0.5% Usukizyme, and 0.5% Pectinase were dissolved in 0.05 M maleic acid buffer of pH 6.0 containing 0.5 M MgSO4. The material was treated for three hours with this enzyme mixture. The number of protoplasts obtained by this method were about 1x10(6) in Ig, fresh weight, of the mesophyll tissue. Furthermore, when protoplasts were prepared from the developed mesophyll tissue grown under different culture conditions with different NaCl concentrations, differences in the traits of the osmotic pressure of the cell membrane in the protoplasts were recognized.",1,1995,,WOS:A1995TK12200008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MIA was a more potent inhibitor of both trout apparent erythrocyte proton extrusion (IC50 = 20.1 +/- 1.1 mumol l-1, N = 6) activity (as evaluated by measuring plasma pH changes after addition of catecholamine in vitro) and specific H-3-MIA binding (IC50 = 257 +/- 8.2 nmol l-1, N = 3) than amiloride, which possessed a proton extrusion IC50 of 26.1 +/- 1.6 mumol l-1 (N = 6) and a binding IC50 of 891 +/- 113 nmol l-1 (N = 3). The specific Na+ channel blocker phenamil was without effect on adrenergic proton extrusion activity or specific H-3-MIA binding.

Acute hypoxia (PO2 = 1.2 kPa; 30 min) did not affect the K(D), yet resulted in a 65 % increase in the number of presumptive Na+/H+ antiporters. Normoxic eel erythrocytes, similarly suspended in Na+-free saline, possessed only 17,133 +/- 3,716 presumptive Na+/H+ antiporters (N = 6), 45 % of that of trout erythrocytes, with a similar K(D) (246 +/- 41 nmol l-1, N=6). These findings suggest that inter- and intra-specific differences in the responsiveness of the teleost erythrocyte beta-adrenergic signal transduction system can be explained, in part, by differences in the numbers of Na+/H+ exchange sites.",5,1994,10.1007/BF00004448,WOS:A1994NE83500002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seedlings and 1-yr-old plants were cultured without substrate for 57 days in seawater media with unmanipulated CO2(aq) levels and approximately 2X, 4X and 10X equilibrium (i.e. 11 mum CO2(aq)) levels. Fractionation of stable carbon isotopes generally increased as a function of CO2(aq), ranging from 12.1 to 21.0 parts per thousand for the year-old plants and from 8.1 to 15.4% parts per thousand for the seedlings. The larger isotopic fractionation effects exhibited by the year-old plants, as compared to those exhibited by seedlings, may have reflected reduced contributions of isotopically heavy seed reserves. Because of inter-mesocosm pH variability, mean CO2(aq) levels in the unmanipulated mesocosm were about 15 % higher, although mean levels of total dissolved inorganic carbon were about 24% lower, than in the 2X mesocosm. Comparatively larger fractionations exhibited by seedlings and year-old plants in the unmanipulated mesocosm suggest a greater importance for CO2(aq) and a correspondingly lower relative importance of HCO3- as the initial substrate for carbon fixation in this species.",10,1993,10.1016/0022-0981(93)90192-Q,WOS:A1993LP04800002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also measured a Pb-210 depth profile (suggesting a burial velocity of 0.94 cm yr-1) and experimentally determined the rate constant for sulfate reduction (0.062 yr-1).Waves and turbulence have mixed sediment and pore waters to a depth of 15 cm. However, both stoichiometric and transport-reaction models argue that molecular diffusion dominates solute transport beneath this mixed zone and that the pore waters are open to diffusion despite rapid burial. Diagenetic modeling shows further that diffusion accounts for 95% of the SO42-, SIGMAH2S, and SIGMACO2 fluxes below the mixed layer. Comparison of model results with sulfur burial fluxes indicates that at least 94% of the generated SIGMAH2S diffuses out of the sediments. The pore-water SIGMACO2 is also within 5% of that predicted by our models. The C:N ratio of the decaying organic matter is calculated to be between 3.86 and 6.87, which is less than half that obtained by analysis of the solids.The carbonate chemistry of the pore waters suggests that they are nearly saturated with respect to aragonite in the mixed zone, even though this mineral has not been identified in the solids.

In neutral water, proton excretion causes a marked reduction in gill water pH. If water pH is 2.5 units lower than blood pH, however, then this proton excretion is inhibited and all water pH changes can be accounted for by CO2 hydration and ammonia protonation. Proton excretion across the gills is insensitive to 0.1 mmoll-1 amiloride and SITS but sensitive to vanadate, acetazolamide and water pH; thus, we conclude that proton excretion is mediated by an active proton pump on the apical membrane of the gill epithelium similar to that reported for the frog skin. Higher concentrations of amiloride (0.5 and 1 mmoll-1) reduced both ammonia and acid excretion, presumably because of inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral border of the gill epithelium.",137,1991,,WOS:A1991GR43700007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
