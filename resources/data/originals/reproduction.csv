However, the extent to which individual MPAs are connected remains mostly unknown. Here, we use a biophysical model tuned with empirical data on species dispersal ecology to predict connectivity of a vast spectrum of biodiversity in the European network of marine reserves (i.e., no-take MPAs). Our results highlight the correlation between empirical propagule duration data and connectivity potential and show weak network connectivity and strong isolation for major ecological groups, resulting from the lack of direct connectivity corridors between reserves over vast regions. The particularly high isolation predicted for ecosystemstructuring species (e.g., corals, sponges, macroalgae and seagrass) might potentially undermine biodiversity conservation efforts if local retention is insufficient and unmanaged populations are at risk. Isolation might also be problematic for populations' persistence in the light of climate change and expected species range shifts. Our findings provide novel insights for management directives, highlighting the location of regions requiring additional marine reserves to function as stepping-stone connectivity corridors.

Elias; von Dorrien, Christian; Oesterwind, Daniel",Marine Protected Areas: At the Crossroads of Nature Conservation and Fisheries Management,.,.,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are designated parts of the ocean that restrict human activities to a certain degree. MPAs are established around the world using a wide range of legislative instruments and thus come in a variety of forms and shapes. Despite being regarded as the ""cornerstone"" of global marine conservation efforts, they currently cover less than 10% of the ocean surface. Individual MPAs aim to achieve goals ranging from the protection of specific habitats or species to sustaining certain commercial activities, such as fishing. By default, the establishment of MPAs intertwines social, ecological and economic considerations. Yet, the emphasis put on each of these domains can vary substantially when setting on-the-ground objectives, frequently creating conflict among stakeholders. In this manuscript, we first discuss current international conservation targets as well as potential future goals and delve into the question of how to assess the effectiveness of MPAs. Subsequently, we discuss the ambivalent role of this widely applied management tool at the crossroads between biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Placing MPAs in a social-ecological framework, we call for clear and measurable goals to evaluate MPAs from an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, we present the Baltic Sea, with its high degree of anthropogenic impact, long fishing history and comparatively extensive MPA coverage, as an interesting case study to investigate the role of MPAs in promoting a sustainable management of the ocean.",0,2021,10.3389/fmars.2021.676264,WOS:000662882700001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,not about connectivity

However, certain areas within the Florida Keys, especially the Dry Tortugas and many upper mesophotic habitats (30-60 m), have maintained relatively healthy coral communities, even in the face of recent severe and widespread coral disease outbreaks. Relatively little is known about the genetic connectivity of corals among these sites or the potential for mesophotic sites to act as refugia by contributing to metapopulation recovery and persistence. Using a paired shallow and upper mesophotic sampling design, we assessed the genetic connectivity of a dominant, broadcast spawning coral species, Montastraea cavernosa, across the Northern and Southern Dry Tortugas, Lower Florida Keys, and Upper Florida Keys. A genetic dataset based on a suite of > 9000 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci indicated that the level of vertical genetic connectivity between paired shallow and upper mesophotic populations varied significantly based on location. Shallow and upper mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in the Northern Dry Tortugas and the Upper Keys were genetically similar. In contrast, populations were significantly differentiated across depth in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas. While upper mesophotic populations in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas were distinct from their shallow counterparts, there was evidence of relatively high levels of genetic connectivity to both the shallow and upper mesophotic populations downstream in the Upper Keys. These results suggest that while vertical connectivity between paired shallow and mesophotic populations can vary, certain upper mesophotic populations may fill an important role in maintaining coral metapopulations throughout the Florida Keys and should be considered in future management strategies.",0,2021,10.1007/s00338-021-02112-y,WOS:000658282800001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

Therefore, connectivity between habitat patches is becoming even more important. China began building national parks with the primary purpose of protecting nationally representative natural ecosystems and maintaining the integrity of their structure, processes and functions. Research is necessary to improve the internal connectivity of national parks and to propose suggestions for existing functional zoning and biological corridors. In this study, Qianjiangyuan National Park was selected as an example park, and landscape fragmentation was evaluated exponentially and simulated visually. The habitat characteristics of protected species in the region, morphological spatial pattern analysis and the delta of the probability of connectivity were used together to identify key habitat patches and their importance levels in the study area. Potential habitat corridors in the region were then obtained using least-cost path analysis and gravity modeling methods based on the distribution of key habitat and the migration costs of target species. The results of this study show that the disturbed landscape of the study area is dominated by tea plantations and drylands, with central roads being an important factor affecting the overall landscape connectivity. In terms of the distribution of key habitat patches, the mountains have a high value. In terms of area, their size is not directly proportional to their importance for maintaining landscape connectivity in the region, but large area patches are generally of higher importance. In terms of distance, key habitats that are closer to each other have a stronger correlation and a greater possibility for species migration. Combined with the functional zoning of Qianjiangyuan National Park, the setting of strictly protected areas and recreational areas is reasonable, and traditional use areas and ecological conservation areas could be appropriately adjusted according to the distribution of key habitats. The important corridor in the middle of the ecological conservation area is crucial for the overall connectivity of the national park, and the connectivity between strict protected areas will depend on successful protection of the ecological conservation area.",0,2021,10.3390/su13115944,WOS:000660761400001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

S.; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove; Beger, Maria",The benefits of heterogeneity in spatial prioritisation within coral reef environments,.,.,"Coral reefs are highly vulnerable habitats, threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.",0,2021,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109155,WOS:000654277500004,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about target criteria for MPA design

One characteristic of MPA networks is that MPAs are spatially configured such that they provide the greatest protection possible for multiple species. Yet, it can be difficult to determine optimal MPA network arrangement due to insufficient information on multi-species habitat use and their dispersal abilities as larvae and adults. Here, we propose a modelling approach that involves determining the optimal MPA network configuration for multiple species assemblages, located at different depths and having differing dispersal abilities. As a case study, we applied this methodology in Pacific Canada where we identified optimal MPA configurations to protect 40 species having different pelagic larval duration (proxy for dispersal) at 3 different depth class groupings (proxy for habitat use). Taken together, we found dispersal ability had a larger impact on optimal MPA network configuration for species spending a long time as larvae compared to species spending a short time as larvae. We identify which 10% of this area is most important to conserve to maintain connectivity for a multi-species MPA network and show that half of these sites remain important to conserve in the future as climate change alters connectivity patterns. This model for MPA network design is feasible with limited data which is beneficial for application to other regions and ecosystems.",0,2021,10.1007/s00227-021-03890-3,WOS:000650831800001,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Decades of population genetic studies have revealed generally low levels of genetic structure at large spatial scales (hundreds of kilometres). Yet this result, typically based on discrete sampling designs, does not necessarily imply extensive dispersal. Here, we adopt a continuous sampling strategy along 950 km of coast in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea to address this question in four species. In line with expectations, we observe weak genetic structure at a large spatial scale. Nevertheless, our continuous sampling strategy uncovers a pattern of isolation by distance at small spatial scales (few tens of kilometres) in two species. Individual-based simulations indicate that this signal is an expected signature of restricted dispersal. At the other extreme of the connectivity spectrum, two pairs of individuals that are closely related genetically were found more than 290 km apart, indicating long-distance dispersal. Such a combination of restricted dispersal with rare long-distance dispersal events is supported by a high-resolution biophysical model of larval dispersal in the study area, and we posit that it may be common in marine species.

The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An Australia-wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100 m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta-analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28% greater abundance and 53% greater biomass of fished species compared to adjacent areas open to fishing. However, benefits of protection were not observed across all reserves (heterogeneity), so full subsets generalized additive modelling was used to consider factors that influence marine reserve effectiveness, including distance-based and ecological metrics of connectivity among reserves. Our results suggest that increased connectivity and depth improve the aforementioned marine reserve benefits and that these factors should be considered to optimize such benefits over time. We provide important guidance on factors to consider when implementing marine reserves for the purpose of increasing the abundance and size of fished species, given the expected increase in coverage globally.

Yet, a lack of information on how key habitat characteristics (e.g., area, vertical relief, age) influence the ability of restored habitats to deliver these ecosystem services hinders efforts to maximize the return on restoration investments. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the influence of reef type (natural or restored), taxa, and restored reef size, vertical relief, age, and tidal zone on the presence and magnitude of recruitment enhancement for nekton (i.e., fish and swimming crabs). Both intertidal and subtidal reefs, as well as restored and natural reefs, enhanced nekton recruitment, though there was variation among taxonomic groups with reef types. Recruitment enhancement was more common across taxa on restored (six families) than on natural (one family) reefs. Resident nekton families were more consistently enhanced than transient families. Nekton enhancement varied with a number of restored reef characteristics. Recruitment enhancement increased with greater reef size across taxa, decreased with higher vertical relief for two families, showed maximum recruitment around a single intertidal reef age for one family, and showed minimum recruitment around a single subtidal reef age for three families. Understanding variation across species in response to key design elements will improve restoration success and enhance return on investment.

Network analysis became more important in modeling connectivity, but it is still uncertain which network metrics are reliable predictors of persistence. Here we quantify the impact of connectivity and larval life history on marine metapopulation persistence across the complex seascape of southeast Australia. Our work coupled network-based approaches and eigenanalysis to efficiently estimate metapopulation-wide persistence and the subpopulation contributions. Larval dispersal models were used to quantify species-specific metapopulation connectivity for five important fisheries species, each summarized as a migration matrix. Eigenanalysis helped to reveal metapopulation persistence and determine the importance of node-level network properties. Across metapopulations, the number of local outgoing connections was found to have the largest impact on metapopulation persistence, implying these hub subpopulations may be the most influential in real-world metapopulations. Results also suggest the length of the pre-competency period may be the most influential parameter on metapopulation persistence. Finally, we identified two major hot spots of local connectivity in southeast Australia, each contributing strongly to multispecies persistence.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the distribution and provide an estimation of abundance of the invasive octocoral C. riisei along the Ecuadorian coast, as well as the relationship between its abundance and different environmental variables. In a field survey, high abundances of C. riisei colonies were reported growing over corals and sessile communities at 5 of 43 sampling sites.

Uni- and multivariate model-based tools were applied to analyze the patterns of benthic fauna in relation to environmental factors. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between echinoderm species richness and depth, oxygen, and salinity. Changes in echinoderm community composition were significantly explained by oxygen, longitude, and chlorophyll-a. We observed notable species turnovers at similar to 101 and similar to 86 degrees W, where assemblages tend to be more variable across stations. This turnover possibly reflects the effects of physical barriers to dispersion (e.g., currents) and habitat changes. Echinoderm assemblages observed around Easter and Desventuradas Islands presented a high occurrence of potentially endemic taxa and distinct species assemblages.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the longterm behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space. Tiger sharks were associated with shallow seagrass habitats where available, but frequently transited between and connected different habitat types.

Thus, maintaining connectivity among coral populations over the long term is a strategy that should be adopted in order to protect diversity and ecological processes. Although coral reefs in Colombia are highly diverse, the population genetics baseline data of keystone species such as Orbicella faveolata are limited.To provide current information about the connectivity between populations of O. faveolata in the Colombian Caribbean, the genetic diversity and distribution of O. faveolata was evaluated with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), principal components, and migration estimations using 113 genets distributed in six populations. Also, a genetic structure analysis that included the available data for the Caribbean population was conducted, seeking to understand how the Colombian populations relate to the broader region.According to the global fixation index (F-ST) for the Colombian Caribbean, there was no genetic structure (F-ST = 0.002). Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) showed that Corales del Rosario Archipelago (CR), Este de Isla Fuerte (EIF), San Bernardo Archipelago (SB), and Varadero Reef (VR) were grouped with Oeste de Isla Fuerte (OIF), with Bushnell (BS) representing the most divergent cluster. Migration analysis showed relatively high migration from VR to CR and SB, highlighting the importance of VR as a genetic reservoir for the region. Structure analysis showed that the Colombian population presented a specific genetic identity (F-ST = 0.254), suggesting that the Colombian Caribbean population could be a peripheral population that contributes significantly to genetic variation and is connected through a complex connectivity process.In conclusion, the estimated genetic connectivity reflects the influence of sea surface dynamics over the interpopulation exchange dynamics and the role of protected and nonprotected coral reef in the Colombian Caribbean.

Turtles display substantial fidelity to the original foraging sites, often traversing other known foraging sites when returning from the breeding migration. A small proportion of turtles also utilise more than one foraging site. Our data indicate that the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi is broadly coincident with the foraging areas of turtles offering substantial protection from fishery activities and that the marine protected area in Ras Al Khaimah would be more effective in protecting green sea turtles if it extended offshore and along the coast.

Energetic constraints on shark pup dispersal from pupping areas.,.,.,"Many sharks and other marine taxa use natal areas to maximize survival of young, meaning such areas are often attributed conservation value. The use of natal areas is often linked to predator avoidance or food resources. However, energetic constraints that may influence dispersal of young and their use of natal areas are poorly understood. We combined swim-tunnel respirometry, calorimetry, lipid class analysis and a bioenergetics model to investigate how energy demands influence dispersal of young in a globally distributed shark. The school shark (a.k.a. soupfin, tope), Galeorhinus galeus, is Critically Endangered due to overfishing and is one of many sharks that use protected natal areas in Australia. Energy storage in neonate pups was limited by small livers, low overall lipid content and low levels of energy storage lipids (e.g. triacylglycerols) relative to adults, with energy stores sufficient to sustain routine demands for 1.3-4days (meanñSD: 2.4ñ0.8days). High levels of growth-associated structural lipids (e.g. phospholipids) and high energetic cost of growth suggested large investment in growth during residency in natal areas. Rapid growth (~40% in length) between birth in summer and dispersal in late autumn-winter likely increased survival by reducing predation and improving foraging ability. Delaying dispersal may allow prioritization of growth and may also provide energy savings through improved swimming efficiency and cooler ambient temperatures (daily ration was predicted to fall by around a third in winter). Neonate school sharks are therefore ill-equipped for large-scale dispersal and neonates recorded in the northwest of their Australian distribution are likely born locally, not at known south-eastern pupping areas. This suggests the existence of previously unrecorded school shark pupping areas. Integrated bioenergetic approaches as applied here may help to understand dispersal from natal areas in other taxa, such as teleost fishes, elasmobranchs and invertebrates.",0,2021,10.1093/conphys/coab017,MEDLINE:33959285,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Past research has focused on 'inside the fence' habitat and bird populations, overlooking the potential for ecosanctuaries to augment bird populations 'outside the fence'. We assessed the amount of habitat around both fenced and unfenced ecosanctuaries in New Zealand, how connected the ecosanctuaries were to the wider landscape, and the overall landscape connectivity around ecosanctuaries, for six bird species at 18 sites (15 fenced; 3 unfenced), assuming a predator-free landscape. We found low levels of high-quality habitat around many fenced ecosanctuaries. There was no high-quality habitat at all around some ecosanctuaries for several bird species. Ecosanctuaries on peninsulas (with reduced fencing costs) tended to have a smaller proportion of the surrounding area in habitat and lower functional connectivity than unfenced ecosanctuaries and ring-fenced sites; meaning the reduced fencing costs at peninsular sites needs to be balanced against less habitat, on average, beyond the ecosanctuary. Managers deciding where to locate ecosanctuaries need to consider both the ecosystems within and those surrounding the site, and connectivity between the two.

Understanding marine traffic dynamics and estimating the associated risk of NIS dispersal reveals points of leverage for preventive NIS management. This study presents a method to quantify the risk of ship hull fouling-mediated NIS dispersal and identifies main dispersal hubs in marine traffic networks. We use the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) as a case study to test the applicability of this method.Ship position data derived from the automatic identification system (AIS) served as a basis for a network consisting of nodes (moorings and anchorages) and edges (ship routes). Wetted surface areas (WSA) describe the parts of vessel hulls submerged by water and were used to parameterize dispersal risks of individual vessels. We combined the constructed network with a numeric dispersal model and sequentially removed network elements to test their effectiveness on decreasing the overall dispersal capacity.Marine traffic hotspots, such as ports and popular marine visitor sites, represented the main dispersal hubs and incoming edges into the GMR crucial links for the overall dispersal capacity. The removal of passenger vessels had the strongest effect on the overall dispersal capacity, reducing it to 1%.Based on our findings, we suggest management recommendations to curb the spread of marine NIS in the GMR, including the implementations of (a) vessel hull controls at main dispersal hubs (ports); (b) species monitoring programmes at popular marine visitor sites and (c) hull husbandry regulations for passenger vessels.Synthesis and application. In an increasingly connected world, the development of risk assessments for marine non-indigenous species (NIS) dispersal is a crucial step towards the sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems in Galapagos and other places.

Despite coastal ecosystems containing well known trophic cascades, there remains uncertainty about the abiotic and biotic factors governing the occurrence and strength of these cascades. Here, we sought to explain the variability of trophic cascades in benthic marine ecosystems by conducting a meta-analysis of experimental (n = 17) and observational (n = 22) studies that recorded herbivore and producer populations in the presence and absence of a predator. From these data (147 predator-herbivore-producer measurements), we show that predators decreased herbivore populations between 2.1-4.76 times and increased producer populations by 1.62-2.83 times their original biomass, abundance, or density. Contrary to past research, these values are comparable to other ecosystems. Biotic factors related to species body size were most influential in determining herbivore population responses to the presence of predators, while abiotic factors, including nutrient concentration, best determined producer population responses. Our results also show that producers responded more strongly to changes in herbivore populations in high-nutrient and low-temperature environments. We found that herbivore populations in marine reserves were 2.83 times lower on average compared to areas outside the reserve, while producer populations were on average 1.90 times higher.

We then used time (and number of turtles) in area analysis on each of these components to quantify the important areas of use, at both rookery and regional/stock scales. We also assessed the representativeness of the calculated distributions, based on the available sample sizes.Results 86% of post-nesting turtles had oceanic or coastal movement to neritic foraging grounds and 14% had local residency to their rookery. The foraging distribution consisted of the inshore waters of most of northwestern Australia. Our sample sizes used for inter-nesting distribution were adequate for 90% of rookeries, but still larger sample sizes were needed for post-nesting distributions.Main conclusions Despite some limitation with sample size, our analyses have provided a quantitative and robust approach to designate marine areas of importance for an endangered species. The spatial extent of the inter-nesting areas was encompassed by existing spatial protection for green turtles during the breeding season, but existing Biologically Important Areas are largely underestimating the foraging areas.

Motivations for restoration from environmental stakeholders most often include recovering lost habitats and associated biodiversity and supporting ecosystem function. In coastal communities, another important justification is recovery of traditional and low-impact fisheries but this has received less attention.Many restoration projects across Europe focus on the translocation of adult stocks, under the assumption that the limit to population growth and recovery is adult growth and survival. This may not necessarily be the case, especially where knowledge of large extant adult populations exists as in the Blackwater, Crouch, Roach and Colne Marine Conservation Zone in Essex, UK. Identifying what limits population growth for restoration and recovery is an important conservation tool.Here, the first size-dependent survival, growth and fecundity data for free-living O. edulis from a novel field experiment are used to parameterize an Integral Projection Model that examines the sensitivity of a flat oyster population to variation in individual vital rates and to potential harvesting - an original objective of a coastal community-led restoration project.Given the high adult fecundity in this species, population recovery is most sensitive to changes in recruitment success; however, elasticity (proportional sensitivity of the population) is more evenly spread across other parameters when recruitment is already high. Based on locally agreed management objectives, recovery to double the current stock biomass should take 16-66 years (mean = 30 years) without active intervention.

Samples were taken from five stations that differed in depth (5, 10, and 15 m) and location (exposed area and sheltered area), aboard a shrimp fishing boat. Over the 20-year period, the percentage of fine sediment increased in all stations. In total, we captured 865H. pudibundusindividuals in the P1 and 4,222 in the P2. The higher abundance seen in the P2 may have been caused by the effects of an intense ENSO event in Ubatuba, as well as co-occurring protective actions against fisheries activities in the region. The spatial distribution also changed after 20 years: In the P1,H. pudibunduswere more concentrated in the 15 m station and exposed area, but they shifted to the sheltered area in the P2. This change may be related to the increase of fine sediments in this area, and to the fact that it is naturally protected from fisheries. According to the correspondence analysis, the abundance of males and juveniles was correlated with spring and winter, respectively. In the P1, females were more abundant in spring, whereas in the P2 they were more abundant in summer, which may be explained by a higher nutrient availability to the larvae in the summer of the P2. Our comparisons over the 20-year interval revealed that the spatio-temporal distribution ofH. pudibundushas changed and that the population is well established in Ubatuba Bay.",0,2020,10.1111/maec.12617,WOS:000579823300001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

However, larval dispersal patterns are variable, which leads to temporal fluctuations in the contribution of a single reserve to the replenishment of local populations. Identifying management strategies that mitigate the uncertainty in larval supply will help ensure the stability of recruitment dynamics and minimize the volatility in fishery catches. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to show extreme variability in both the dispersal patterns and recruitment contribution of four individual marine reserves across six discrete recruitment cohorts for coral grouper (Plectropomus maculatus) on the Great Barrier Reef. Together, however, the asynchronous contributions from multiple reserves create temporal stability in recruitment via a connectivity portfolio effect. This dampening effect reduces the variability in larval supply from individual reserves by a factor of 1.8, which effectively halves the uncertainty in the recruitment contribution of individual reserves. Thus, not only does the network of four marine reserves generate valuable larval subsidies to neighboring habitats, the aggregate effect of individual reserves mitigates temporal fluctuations in dispersal patterns and the replenishment of local populations. Our results indicate that small networks of marine reserves yield previously unrecognized stabilizing benefits that ensure a consistent larval supply to replenish exploited fish stocks.",8,2020,10.1073/pnas.1920580117,WOS:000579507500007,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

The success of MPAs in achieving biodiversity conservation objectives is strongly dependent on effective management. However, evaluation frameworks for MPA management measures are often procedurally or governance focused with limited consideration of biological criteria. Here we review guiding ecological principles of MPA network design and how they can be applied to the evaluation of MPA management measures for effective biodiversity conservation. We have developed a Qualitative Statement Framework that makes recommendations for applying ecological principles to MPA management measures, using the Scottish nature conservation MPA network as a case study. Our statements to guide MPA management measure evaluation relate to principles: representation, ecologically significant areas, rare, threatened or declining features replication, connectivity, adequacy/viability and resilience. We suggest that using the ecological principles for MPA design in management measure evaluation addresses a gap in current management evaluation tools. This approach would be particularly useful in situations where management measures are applied to MPAs post-designation and where MPAs are managed as zoned or multi-use sites. Future MPA management evaluations should incorporate criteria to demonstrate how management measures meet each of the ecological principles.",0,2020,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103625,WOS:000577148600010,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,aim to inform MPA design

In the case of sedentary marine populations, connectivity stems not only from the stochastic nature of the physical environment that affects dispersal of early life stages, but also from the spawning stock attributes that affect reproductive output (e.g. passive eggs and larvae) and survivorship. Early life stages are virtually impossible to track in the ocean. Therefore, numerical ocean current simulations coupled with egg and larval Lagrangian transport models remain the most common approach for the assessment of marine larval connectivity. Inferred larval connectivity may differ depending on the type of connectivity considered; consequently, the prioritisation of sites for the conservation of marine populations might also differ. Here, we introduce a framework for evaluating and designing MPA networks based on the identification of connectivity hotspots using graph theoretic analysis. As a case study, we used a network of open-access areas and MPAs off Mallorca Island (Spain), and tested its effectiveness for the protection of the painted comber Serranus scriba. Outputs from network analysis were used to (1) identify critical areas for improving overall larval connectivity, (2) assess the impact of species' biological parameters in network connectivity and (3) explore alternative MPA configurations to improve average network connectivity.

The present study evaluated the effect of a mangrove NTR on the conservation of juvenile fish abundance, commercial fish biomass and biodiversity at the assemblage level, and the abundance of juveniles, target and non-target adults at the family level. The evaluation incorporated one aspect of seascape connectivity, namely proximity to the sea, or in this case, the Gulf of Paria. Linear mixed models showed that the NTR had a positive effect only on species richness at the assemblage level. However, juvenile fish abundance, commercial fish biomass, taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity were not enhanced in the NTR. The inclusion of connectivity in these models still failed to identify any positive effects of the NTR at the assemblage level. Yet, there were significant benefits to juvenile fish abundance for 5 of 7 families, and for 1 family of non-target adults. Possible explanations for the limited success of the NTR for fish assemblages include failing to account for the ecology of fish species in NTR design, the drawbacks of 'inside-outside' (of the NTR) experimental designs and the fact that fishing does not always impact non-target species. It is important to recognise that mangrove NTRs do not necessarily benefit fish assemblages as a whole, but that finer-scale assessments of specific families may reveal some of the proclaimed benefits of NTRs in tropical estuaries.",0,2020,10.3354/meps13436,WOS:000621226100010,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Although the area protected in MPAs is growing, the movement of individuals (or larvae) among MPAs, termed connectivity, has only recently been included as an objective of many MPAs. As such, assessing connectivity is often neglected or oversimplified in the planning process. For promoting population persistence, it is important to ensure that protected areas in a system are functionally connected through dispersal or adult movement. We devised a multispecies model of larval dispersal for the Australian marine environment to evaluate how much localscale connectivity is protected in MPAs and determine whether the extensive system of MPAs truly functions as a network. We focused on nonmigratory species with simplified larval behaviors (i.e., passive larval dispersal) (e.g., no explicit vertical migration) as an illustration. Of all the MPAs analyzed (approximately 2.7 million km(2)), outside the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef, <50% of MPAs (46-80% of total MPA area depending on the species considered) were functionally connected. Our results suggest that Australia's MPA system cannot be referred to as a single network, but rather a collection of numerous smaller networks delineated by natural breaks in the connectivity of reef habitat. Depending on the dispersal capacity of the taxa of interest, there may be between 25 and 47 individual ecological networks distributed across the Australian marine environment. The need to first assess the underlying natural connectivity of a study system prior to implementing new MPAs represents a key research priority for strategically enlarging MPA networks. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multispecies connectivity into conservation planning to identify opportunities to better incorporate connectivity into the design of MPA systems and thus to increase their capacity to support long-term, sustainable biodiversity outcomes.",2,2021,10.1111/cobi.13580,WOS:000565959100001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,only assesses connectivity within the network

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are key tools for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, yet the fisheries benefits remain debateable. Many MPAs include a fully protected area (FPA), restricting all activities, within a partially protected area (PPA) where potentially sustainable activities are permitted. An effective tool for biodiversity conservation, FPAs, can sustain local fisheries via spillover, that is the outward export of individuals from FPAs. Spillover refers to both: ""ecological spillover"": outward net emigration of juveniles, subadults and/or adults from the FPA; and ""fishery spillover"": the fraction of ecological spillover that directly benefits fishery yields and revenues through fishable biomass. Yet, how common is spillover remains controversial. We present a meta-analysis of a unique global database covering 23 FPAs worldwide, using published literature and purposely collected field data, to assess the capacity of FPAs to export biomass and whether this response was mediated by specific FPA features (e.g. size, age) or species characteristics (e.g. mobility, economic value). Results show fish biomass and abundance outside FPAs was higher: (a) in locations close to FPA borders (<200 m) than further away (>200 m); (b) for species with a high commercial value; and (c) in the presence of PPA surrounding the FPA. Spillover was slightly higher in FPAs that were larger and older and for more mobile species.

We used a 300 km long passive acoustic telemetry network to measure site fidelity and dispersal distances of adult red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) tagged within two estuarine no-take zones at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Seventy-eight tagged fish were tracked an average of 549 days with some individuals followed for over four years. Fish spent most of their total time at liberty inside no-take zones with a mean residency of 125-178 consecutive days after release, and 67%-95% of their total time, depending on species. Sixty-four individuals (82%) also utilized adjacent public waters, dispersing up to 650 km, although dispersal rates averaged less than 0.10 km day(-1) for all three species. Red drum and black drum movements across reserve boundaries were clearly bi-directional with individuals averaging 4 and 30 excursions per year, respectively, into fished areas. Both species spent more time outside reserve boundaries during their reproductive periods, suggesting that these no-take zones protect individuals that subsequently spawn over a wider geographic area. Our findings demonstrate that coastal marine reserves have the potential to provide substantial protection for highly mobile non-reef fishes. They further suggest that reserves designed to safeguard fish during non-reproductive periods may be most practical for estuarine species whose home ranges increase during spawning seasons.

Integrated management strategies aimed at ensuring long-term service provision to society do not currently consider the importance of dispersal and larval connectivity. A spatial optimization model is introduced to maximise the potential provision of ecosystem services in coastal areas by accounting for the role of dispersal and larval connectivity. The approach combines a validated coastal circulation model that reproduces realistic patterns of larval transport along the coast, which ultimately conditions the biological connectivity and productivity of an area, with additional spatial layers describing potential ecosystem services. The spatial optimization exercise was tested along the coast of Central Chile, a highly productive area dominated by the Humboldt Current. Results show it is unnecessary to relocate existing management areas, as increasing no-take areas by 10% could maximise ecosystem service provision, while improving the spatial representativeness of protected areas and minimizing social conflicts. The location of protected areas was underrepresented in some sections of the study domain. principally due to the restriction of the model to rocky subtidal habitats. Future model developments should encompass the diversity of coastal ecosystems and human activities to inform integrative spatial management. Nevertheless, the spatial optimization model is innovative not only for its integrated ecosystem perspective, but also because it demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate time-varying biophysical connectivity within the optimization problem, thereby linking the dynamics of exploited populations produced by the spatial management regime.

Spatial analysis revealed clusters of high seed densities (""hot spots"") in Upper Laguna Madre, TX, and Santa Rosa Sound, FL, and clusters of low seed densities (""cold spots"") in Lower Laguna Madre and Aransas Bay, TX. Hot spots were dominated byH. wrightii, whereas cold spots were dominated byThalassia testudinum(turtle grass). We frequently found intact seed coat halves, suggesting germination; however, we also encountered broken seed coat pieces, characteristic of seed predation. Genotypic surveys within and adjacent to seed hot spots revealed genetically diverse adult populations 6 years post seed bank sampling. Our data show thatH. wrightiiseed reserves are heterogeneous across the northern Gulf of Mexico and that the factors driving variation in seed bank density, viability, and germination remain poorly understood.

We obtained comparable data about the distribution and abundance of this species collected 20 years apart, to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPA, for its preservation and possible changes in the populational profile. Biotic and abiotic data were obtained monthly, in September 1995-August 1996 (period 1 = 1oP), and in September 2016-August 2017 (period 2 = 2oP), from five transects within Ubatuba Bay. In total, 710 and 2,362 individuals were caught in the 1(o)P and 2(o)P, respectively. Despite this increase in abundance, aspects of the spatial distribution did not change substantially. The high abundance recorded at 5 m of depth was probably due to the creation of the MPA and to the accumulation of detritus at this depth. The high abundance seen in the transect sheltered from waves may be related to sediment heterogeneity, which was higher in this transect, and to the fact that this area is naturally protected from fisheries. In the 1oP, the highest abundances were recorded in spring and summer, whereas in the 2oP, they occurred in autumn and winter. This change may be explained by the entrance of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), which drives shrimps towards shallower areas. During the 2oP, a fishing ban occurred in autumn (March 1st until May 31st), which is also when the SACW retreats and water temperature and salinity increase. These two factors combined may have been responsible for the increased shrimp abundance. In conclusion, both conservation practices (MPA and fishing ban) along with the existence of an area naturally protected from fisheries seem to have positively affected the population ofR. constrictus, leading to an increase in abundance over the 20-year interval.",0,2020,10.1111/maec.12605,WOS:000559024200001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

The reduction of complexity may be achieved by partitioning the metapopulation into groups of highly connected patches called ""subpopulations."" To have relevance for management, these subunits must be defined from ecological or evolutionary principles. The probabilities of dispersal-mediated propagule interchange between sites, commonly organized into a connectivity matrix, entail a timescale that is usually ignored in subpopulation analyses, limiting their utility and possibly leading to misinterpretation and wrong management decisions. Recognition of the essentially dynamical role played by metapopulation connectivity naturally leads to the incorporation of the generational timescale into the partitioning analysis. An algorithm is proposed to determine the subpopulations-both their cardinality and their composition-as a function of the generational timescale and of a limiting probability of connection, illustrated with a novel empirical estimate of mesopelagic connectivity. The proposed framework allows the unambiguous determination of the timescales corresponding to dispersal barriers and the identification of effective ecological units across the spectrum of management-relevant time horizons.",0,2020,10.1086/709548,WOS:000548984500006,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

These pressures have caused widespread declines in reef health, resulting in the increased use of spatial management tools such as marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs have proven generally effective if well designed and enforced, but there are limited long-term studies investigating how the presence of small-scale MPAs affects fish populations and reef communities. Using a 12-year time series, we found that small-scale (10-50 ha) community-managed MPAs along the Danajon Bank of the Philippines preserved average fish biomass within their boundaries over time relative to surrounding fished reefs. Unprotected areas are, however, showing significant long-term biomass decline. MPAs were also found to preserve more key trophic groups and larger-bodied commercially targeted reef fish families. Fish biomass of piscivore, scavenger and invertivore trophic groups inside individual MPAs is, however, still declining at a similar rate as outside. Surprisingly, long-term benthic cover and growth form composition were not significantly affected overall by MPA presence, despite the sporadic use of highly destructive dynamite fishing in this region. Coral cover has remained historically low (21-28%) throughout the study, following widespread bleaching mortality. While management tempered overall abundance declines, we found that irrespective of MPA presence, there was a generalised decline of both large- and small-bodied fish size groups across the study region, most steeply within the 20-30 cm length fish, and a shift towards proportionally higher abundances of small (5-10 cm) fish. This indicates a combination of over-exploitation, inadequate MPA size and coverage for larger fish, and the lingering effects of the 1998 bleaching event.

For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.",0,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13706,WOS:000553283200001,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,model

Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families.

We herein characterize the larva transport patterns associated with surface currents that control connectivity in the reserve.

Connectivity between these three groups is evident only for the longest PLD examined (360 d). Connectivity from seamounts to coastal ecosystems is weak, with a maximum of 2% of larvae originating from seamounts reaching coastal ecosystems.

Information on PLD and age of larvae collected at MR and LP are used to assess their putative origin.

Ideally, an MPA should protect all key habitats necessary for a marine species to complete its life cycle. The identification of these key habitats is complex, especially during the early life of marine fishes.A widely distributed tropical and important low trophic-level fish species, Spratelloides delicatulus (Clupeidae), was used to evaluate the significance of various coastal habitats for its larvae and juveniles in the Con Dao Archipelago MPA in Vietnam. Early stages (larvae and juveniles) were sampled monthly over one year (June 2016 to May 2017) using light traps in three main habitats (seagrass beds, coral reefs and harbour). The species was identified using morphometry and DNA barcoding. Age and growth variables were estimated using otolith daily growth increments.A total of 3,581 fish were caught. The species was not found in captures between January and February, directly linked to the decrease in seawater temperature and was most abundant from April to June. For a subsample of 248 fish (7-38 mm standard length), ages ranged from 7 to 108 days.Captures and back-calculated birthdates using otolith daily increments showed that S. delicatulus spawns during the period of high seawater temperature, from March to October. The species colonizes all three habitats during the early stages (0-26 days old), with growth rate lowest on the seagrass beds. Nevertheless, the species occupies seagrass beds exclusively during the older stages.The conservation of seagrass beds in the Con Dao archipelago is essential for protection of juvenile stages of this species but this habitat is presently not included in the MPA patches. Establishment of a continuum of protected areas linking habitats, rather than the existing patches is needed to conserve the complete life cycle of this species in the Con Dao MPA. 1.2.3.4.5.",0,2020,10.1002/aqc.3361,WOS:000536014300001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,aim to inform MPA design

It is driven by ocean currents, which often have very complex patterns within reef systems. Only biophysical models that simulate both the fine-scale details of ocean currents and the life-history traits of larvae transported by these currents can help to estimate connectivity in large reef systems. Here we use the unstructured-mesh coastal ocean model SLIM that locally achieves a spatial resolution of similar to 100 m, 10 times finer than existing models, over the entire Florida Reef Tract (FRT). It allows us to simulate larval dispersal between the similar to 1,000 reefs composing the FRT. By using different connectivity measures and clustering methods, we have identified two major connectivity pathways, one originating on the westernmost end of the outer shelf and the other originating on the inner shelf, North of the Lower Keys. We introduce new connectivity indicators, based on the PageRank algorithm, to show that protection efforts should be focused on the most upstream reefs of each pathway, while reefs best suited for restoration are more evenly spread between the Lower and Upper Keys. We identify one particular reef, North of Vaca Key, that is a major stepping stone in the connectivity network. Our results are the first reef-scale connectivity estimates for the entire FRT.

Because of its high invasion capacity, we used it as a model to identify the connectivity among nine marine protected areas (MPAs) situated in four countries in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. This study provides evidence of local genetic differentiation of P. volitans in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. A total of 475 lionfish samples were characterized with 12 microsatellites, with 6-20 alleles per locus. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were found in 10 of the 12 loci, all caused by heterozygous excess. Moderate genetic differentiation was observed between Chiriviche, Venezuela and Xcalak, Mexico localities (F-ST = 0.012), and between the Los Roques and the Veracruz (F-ST = 0.074) sites. STRUCTURE analysis found that four genetic entities best fit our data. A unique genetic group in the Gulf of Mexico may imply that the lionfish invasion unfolded both in a counterclockwise manner in the Gulf of Mexico. In spite of the notable dispersion of P. volitans, our results show some genetic structure, as do other noninvasive Caribbean fish species, suggesting that the connectivity in some MPAs analyzed in the Caribbean is limited and caused by only a few source individuals with subsequent genetic drift leading to local genetic differentiation. This indicates that P. volitans dispersion could be caused by mesoscale phenomena, which produce stochastic connectivity pulses. Due to the isolation of some MPAs from others, these findings may hold a promise for local short-term control of by means of intensive fishing, even in MPAs, and may have regional long-term effects.",0,2020,10.1002/ece3.5829,WOS:000534741200002,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,only assesses connectivity within the network

Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27) of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82% of real-world examples of climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs, highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers, and we discuss how these could be overcome.

This means evaluating their genetic population structure and gene flow, and the degree of connectivity among natural beds. To do this, the spatial genetic population structure of seven natural Mytilus chilensis beds within the mussels' present distribution range along the Chilean coast was evaluated. Genetic differences were established between populations with cytochrome oxidase I (COD gene sequences (Fst = 0.099) and microsatellites (Fst = 0.048), showing that locations that consistently presented greater differentiation were those at the extremes of the geographical distribution. An ""isolation by distance"" pattern was not observed in the COI and microsatellite data. We suggest that because of the high resolution of these markers, the differences between locations may be explained by high reproductive variance, which determines local changes in each reproductive cycle of the species. These changes would account for the differences between the natural beds. Furthermore, differentiated genetic types were observed in some locations, demonstrating the presence of local processes in some cases, perhaps caused by gene flow restrictions resulting from the local geomorphological and oceanographic conditions. The gene structure and connectivity of natural beds in sessile species with larval dispersion are strongly determined by local retention characteristics. For this reason, the data generated in this study can be used to improve population management. These data can also be used to support and motivate the creation of a marine protected area containing natural beds of this species with sufficient levels of genetic diversity.",2,2020,10.2983/035.039.0108,WOS:000526050800008,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,assesses genetic structuring but not role of MPA

RAD-seq analysis of 94 Nassau grouper sampled from nine locations in The Bahamas generated a working dataset of 13,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Similar levels of genetic diversity were found among sampled locations. Evidence of population sub-structuring across The Bahamas was demonstrated and supported by discriminate analysis of principal components (DAPCs) along with analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs). Associated acoustic telemetry data indicated Nassau grouper tagged at an active FSA in the central Bahamas during the 2016-2017 spawning season migrated to the Exumas at the conclusion of the spawning period. Telemetry data suggest the likely origins of five individuals, which traveled one-way distances of up to 176 km from the FSA in the central Bahamas to two sites within a no-take marine protected area (MPA).

We apply a range of empirically-grounded scenarios for future larval dispersal to fishery models of seven species currently managed through marine reserves in the nearshore waters in Southern California, USA. We show that networks of reserves optimized for future climate conditions differ substantially from networks designed for today's conditions. However, the benefits of redesign are modest: a set of reserves designed for current conditions commonly produces outcomes within 10% of the best redesigned network, and far outperforms haphazardly designed networks.

However, successive decades of poor management and overfishing led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity and the collapse of finfish fisheries. In response, concerned local residents on the Isle of Arran, which lies in the middle of the Clyde, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) in 1995. After 13 years of campaigning, a small (2.67 km(2)) area in Lamlash Bay became Scotland's first no-take zone (NTZ) in 2008, and only the second in the UK. Since protection, biodiversity has increased substantially, along with the size, age and density of commercially important species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus, and the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Arguably more important, however, is the influence the Lamlash Bay NTZ and COAST have had on UK marine protection in general. Most notably, detailed research has created a case study that clearly demonstrates the benefits of protection in an area where little such evidence is available. This case has been used repeatedly to support efforts for increased protection of UK waters to help rebuild marine ecosystems and enhance their resilience in an uncertain future. In Scotland specifically, lobbying by COAST led to the designation of a much larger marine protected area (MPA, > 250 km(2)) around the south of Arran, one of 30 new MPAs in the country. Evidence from Lamlash Bay has supported development of strong protection for these MPAs, seeing off lobbyist efforts to weaken management.

Knowledge of genetic connectivity (gene flow) amongst populations of VME-associated taxa, such as squat lobsters, will contribute to ongoing management decision-making related to the protection of VMEs. To better understand the genetic diversity and genetic structure of squat lobster populations (Munida isos, Munida endeavourae and Munida gracilis) at different spatial scales (biogeographic provinces, regions and geomorphic features) in the southwest Pacific Ocean, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region and nuclear microsatellite markers were employed.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of COI variation revealed no significant genetic differentiation, whereas AMOVA of microsatellite variation revealed significant genetic differentiation amongst the three species, but at different spatial scales. Based on microsatellite variation, a range of analyses [Structure, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)] provided some evidence of limited genetic differentiation at different spatial scales across the three species. Low to moderate levels of assignment success (similar to 40-60%) based on microsatellite variation were achieved for the three Munida species, suggesting high levels of gene flow and possible panmixia.

To help maintain and restore marine populations and communities MPAs should form ecologically coherent networks. How to estimate and implement connectivity in MPA design remains a challenge. Here a new theoretical framework is presented based on biophysical modelling of organism dispersal, combined with a suite of tools to assess different aspects of connectivity that can be integrated in MPA design. As a demonstration, these tools are applied to an MPA network in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM MPA). The tools are based on the connectivity matrix, which summarizes dispersal probabilities, averaged over many years, between all considered areas in the geographic target area. The biophysical model used to estimate connectivity included important biological traits that affect dispersal patterns where different trait combinations and habitat preferences will produce specific connectivity matrices representing different species. Modelled connectivity matrices were used to assess local retention within individual MPAs, which offers indications about the adequacy of size when MPAs are considered in isolation. The connectivity matrix also provides information about source areas to individual MPAs, e.g. sources of larvae or pressures such as contaminants. How well several MPAs act as a network was assessed within a framework of eigenvalue perturbation theory (EPT). With EPT, the optimal MPA network with respect to connectivity can be identified. In addition, EPT can suggest optimal extensions of existing MPA networks to enhance connectivity. Finally, dispersal barriers can be identified based on the connectivity matrix, which may suggest boundaries for management units. The assessment of connectivity for the HELCOM MPA are discussed in terms of possible improvements, but the tools presented here could be applied to any region.",6,2020,10.1002/aqc.3286,WOS:000506858900001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,aim to inform MPA design

From March 2017 to June 2018, 45 permit tagged within 16 km of the lower Florida Keys were detected at stationary acoustic receivers throughout the south Florida region, the majority of which remained within the Special Permit Zone, where more extensive fisheries harvest regulations are implemented. There was a high level of connectivity between nearshore flats (i.e., <3 m water depth) and the Florida reef tract (FRT; 15-40 m water depth), with 75% of individuals detected in both habitats. These locations probably function primarily as foraging and spawning habitats, respectively. Permit occupancy on the FRT peaked during the months of March-September, with the highest number of individuals occurring there in April and May. Specific sites on the FRT were identified as potentially important spawning locations, as they attracted a high proportion of individuals that exhibited frequent visits with high residency durations.

Due to its large size and complex life history characteristics, it is vulnerable to overfishing and has undergone substantial population declines in parts of its range. Knowledge of the species' movement ecology is currently limited to only 2 previous studies, and very little is known about populations in the western Indian Ocean. The present study aimed to use passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the importance of a remote coral reef to a population of humphead wrasse in the Republic of Seychelles, and subsequently assess the efficacy of a proposed marine protected area at this location for protection of the species. Tagged fish (n = 20) exhibited persistent (> 500 d) site fidelity, with low dispersal distances (mean +/- SD: 6.44 +/- 4.0 km) and restricted core activity spaces (50% Brownian bridge kernel utilization density: 0.91 +/- 0.61 km(2)). Additionally, the study site was home to a group of large (total length 97.9 +/- 20.6 cm) and currently unexploited humphead wrasse that showed longterm predictable site fidelity and thus could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. The establishment of a proposed no-take marine protected area at the study site would encompass the core home range area of all tagged humphead wrasse and could effectively conserve this stronghold of Endangered fish to ensure the persistence of the species in Seychelles waters.",1,2020,10.3354/esr01035,WOS:000619513900001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,"no MPA, no control"

However, with increasing environmental change driven by local and global stressors, it is critical to understand whether MPAs can continue to provide social, economic and conservation benefits in the long-term. Here, we compare coral reef benthic and fish assemblages across 17 paired MPA-fished control sites on three heavily populated, high elevation ""mainland"" islands, and four lowly populated, low elevation ""offshore"" islands that differed in their exposure to recent typhoons. Despite lower cover of macroalgae in MPAs compared to fished areas, especially on mainland islands, there were no consistent differences in benthic assemblages or total hard coral cover between paired MPA and fished reefs. Typhoons had severe negative effects on live hard coral cover, regardless of island type or MPA protection, and typhoon impacted reefs supported different fish assemblages and lower total biomass of fish, compared to non-impacted reefs. Although fish assemblage structure and total biomass differed between mainland and offshore islands, MPAs consistently supported a higher total biomass of fish than fished areas, with the magnitude of the MPA effect lower on typhoon impacted reefs. Our findings suggest that despite inherent differences in environmental conditions between mainland and offshore island coral reefs, MPAs can provide benefits to fish biomass, even when reefs are affected by typhoons.

Location Canadian Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Oceans from the intertidal zone to upper bathyal depths, encompassing 13 marine ecoregions. Methods We compiled 35 benthic datasets that encompass 3,337 taxa (70% identified to species and 21% to genus) from 13,172 samples spanning 6,117 sites. Partitioning the analyses by different gear types, ecoregions or sites, we used Hill numbers to examine spatial patterns in alpha-diversity. We used resampling and extrapolation to standardized sampling effort and examined the effects of depth, latitude, chemical energy (export particulate organic carbon [POC] flux), thermal energy (bottom temperature) and seasonality of primary production on the benthic biodiversity. Results The Canadian Arctic harboured the highest benthic diversity (e.g. epifauna and common and dominant infauna species), whereas the lowest diversity was found in the Atlantic. The Puget Trough (Pacific), Beaufort Sea, Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Northern Labrador and Southern Grand Bank (Atlantic) were the ""hotspots"" of diversity among the ecoregions. The infauna and epifauna both exhibited hump-shaped diversity-depth relationships, with peak diversity near shelf breaks; latitude (positively) predicted infaunal diversity, albeit weakly. Food supply, as inferred from primary production and depth, was more important than thermal energy in controlling diversity patterns. Limitations with respect to calculating POC flux in coastal (e.g. terrestrial runoff) and ice-covered regions or biological interactions may explain the negative POC flux-infaunal diversity relationship. Main Conclusions We show previously unreported diversity hotspots in the Canadian Arctic and in other ecoregions. Our analyses reveal potential controlling mechanisms of large-scale benthic biodiversity patterns in Canada's three oceans, which are inconsistent with the prevailing view of seafloor energy-diversity relationships.

The best models for both species included upwelling variability among years (i.e., persistent versus pulsed upwelling). The effects of upwelling variability differed depending on coastal geography. In the lees of headlands, foraging rates were highest and more stable with respect to upwelling variability. For all other coastal configurations, pulsed upwelling was associated with higher foraging rates. Thus, periods of relaxation in upwelling appear to be important for these sites.

Connectivity rate, measured as the exchange of individuals between spawning and nursery grounds, is therefore a crucial determinant of stock size. However, connectivity of early-life stages is hard to explore due to sampling limitations and insufficient knowledge on potential larval sources. Here we present new insights into pre- and post-settlement dispersal of the common sole (Solea solea L.) at a spatial scale of 5-500 km in the Southern North Sea. Patterns at a scale of < 100 km were considered local, whereas patterns further than 100 km were considered regional.

Interregional differences in otolith composition (especially for Mg, Mn and Ba) suggest that sole migration following settlement is limited in the Southern North Sea. Elemental signatures of the same fish indicated mixing during larval dispersal. Each nursery ground recruited an important mix of juveniles from three of the four chemically distinct natal sources identified from the larval otolith signatures.

In this context, beyond passive restoration measures such as the creation of marine protected areas, it is urgent that we explore active restoration measures to enhance and accelerate the recovery of sessile marine species. Bryozoans are among the most common sessile invertebrates in rocky bottom ecosystems and are considered habitat-forming species that are highly vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as recreational diving, ghost fishing nets, and global warming, which makes them highly vulnerable to other impacts. Despite their ecological importance and vulnerability, to date restoration actions for bryozoans have rarely been explored. In this study, different restoration techniques were developed and tested, with a focus on two types of effective methodologies previously applied to other marine invertebrates: recruitment enhancement and the transplantation of adult colonies, in both cases using the Mediterranean bryozoan Pentapora fascialis as a model species. First, different types of artificial surfaces were installed in different coralligenous habitats to test the enhancement of recruitment, concluding that plastic grids are the best substrate in terms of facilitating the recruitment of new bryozoan colonies. Second, different methodologies were tested for adult transplantation. The most successful was to fix colonies to a suitable substrate with a nylon thread attached to the colony ex situ (i.e. on the boat). Using this technique a trial restoration programme was undertaken, involving transplanting adult colonies collected from a ghost fishing net trapped on the bottom, which showed a high survival rate of similar to 50% after 6 months.

The use of a non-invasive methodology, which does not cause damage or alterations on benthic communities, is particularly necessary in vulnerable ecosystem studies and MPA monitoring.This study analyzed the assemblage structure of a Placogorgia sp. population using a 3D photogrammetry-based method. The study was carried out through the analysis of the video transects obtained at the Le Danois Bank, using the Politolana underwater towed vehicle during the July 2017 ECOMARG survey.

Populations of the ecologically important purple urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) have fluctuated widely, most recently with a population boom in the late 1990s, followed by a mass mortality that persists to the present day. Eight general hypotheses have been proposed to account for the urchin decline including cold temperature limiting reproduction, ephemeral algal exudates disrupting urchin fertilization, low larval availability (due to over-harvesting and/or episodic recruitment), high mortality of settlers and juveniles due to hypoxia, hyperoxia, or predation (a trophic cascade hypothesis), and increased mortality due to pathogens (stress hypothesis). The cold-temperature and the trophic cascade hypotheses appear unlikely. The remaining hypotheses, however, all seem to play a role, to some degree, in driving the urchin decline. Ulvoid exudates, for example, significantly reduced urchin fertilization and few larvae were found in plankton tows (2012-2015), indicating low larval availability in summer. Whilst settling urchins regularly recruited under shallow-subtidal rocks until 2011, no settlers were found in these habitats from 2011 to 2014 or in field experiments (2012-2018) using various settlement substrata. Seawater quality was poor in shallow areas of the lough with extreme oxygen fluctuations (diel-cycling hypoxia), and 1-day experimental exposures to DO values < 1 mg L-1 were lethal to most juvenile urchins. Multiple increases of the predatory spiny starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) population in recent decades may also have contributed to the demise of the coexisting juvenile urchins. Finally, urchins of all sizes were seen suffering from dropped spines, tissue necrosis, or white-coloured infection, suggestive of stress-related pathogen mortality. There was a paucity of broken tests, indicating limited predation by large crustaceans; the large number of adult urchins 'missing' and few P. lividus tests on the north shore points to possible urchin removal by poachers and/or starfish predation. While these ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic processes occur on open coast rocky shores, many are exacerbated by the semi-enclosed nature of this fully marine sea lough due to its limited flushing. Multiple factors, including low larval availability and rapidly expanding starfish populations, coupled with degraded habitat quality (ephemeral algal mats and extreme oxygen fluctuations), indicate that the purple urchin populations will not recover without an improvement in the water quality of Lough Hyne Marine Reserve, the restocking of urchins, and protection from poaching.",3,2019,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106271,WOS:000482495700032,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Isolation, in combination with other factors, may preclude recruit subsidies, thus slowing recovery when base populations are small and causing a mismatch between performance and stakeholder expectations. Mona Island is a small, oceanic island located within a partial biogeographic barrier-44 km from the Puerto Rico shelf. We investigated if Mona Island's no-take zone (MNTZ), the largest in the U.S. Caribbean, was successful in increasing mean size and density of a suite of snapper and grouper species 14 years after designation. The La Parguera Natural Reserve (LPNR) was chosen for evaluation of temporal trends at a fished location. Despite indications of fishing within the no-take area, a reserve effect at Mona Island was evidenced from increasing mean sizes and densities of some taxa and mean total density 36% greater relative to 2005. However, the largest predatory species remained rare at Mona, preventing meaningful analysis of population trends. In the LPNR, most commercial species (e.g., Lutjanus synagris, Lutjanus apodus, Lutjanus mahogoni) did not change significantly in biomass or abundance, but some (Ocyurus chrysurus, Lachnolaimus maximus), increased in abundance owing to strong recent recruitment.

Despite substantial research within the Marine park, little rigorous evaluation has been undertaken of the rezoning's biological impact - the difference increased protection has made to biodiversity relative to that expected without protection. We review available data of measures of biological impact from 'new' no-take zones established in the rezoning and those established under previous zoning. We found 48 studies reporting 782 measures of impact based on comparisons of biological indicators in no-take zones with fished areas. Overwhelmingly, impacts were neutral (57%) or positive (33%). Few data supported causal relationships between new no-take zones and improvements in biological indicators (48 of 159 impacts). The probability of a positive impact increased with time from establishment of no-take zones. Limited conclusions can be drawn from other data. We evaluated whether these measures of impact were robust based on analysis of six key principles of impact evaluation. Sampling was not designed to support causal inferences.

One county promoted a net subsidy program of preferred mesh sizes with a distinct purchase and distribution date, while the other supported the ongoing maintenance of fisheries closures. This provoked a BACI design where standard fisheries statistics were measured 3 years prior to and 2.5 years after the net subsidy, or the life expectancy of these nets. Only similar to 50% of the purchased nets were utilized, indicating a replacement rather than addition of capital and low need. For example, net fishing effort did not change and there was an overall demographic change in gear use away from traps toward lower cost spearguns. Net subsidized fisheries displayed a 9% increase in the mean length of captured fish but also a decline in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) and personal incomes and no change in prices, yields, and per area incomes. In contrast, the fisheries surrounding closures displayed increased fishing effort and a 4% decline in fish lengths but increased CPUE, yield, incomes, and per area revenues. The net cost of maintaining closures was less than the gear subsidy purchase. Significant time x treatment interactions in all indicators support the conclusion that gear subsidies, apart from larger fish sizes, worsened the fisheries, while closures improved it.

Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) have been created in European waters under the Habitats Directive to protect bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, which forms two ecotypes, pelagic and coastal. The SACs have been designated in coastal waters based on photo-identification studies that have indicated that bottlenose dolphins have relatively high site fidelity. However, individuals can carry out long-distance movements, which suggests potential for demographic connectivity between the SACs as well as with other areas. Connectivity can be studied using genetic markers. Previous studies on the species in this area used different sets of genetic markers and therefore inference on the fine-scale population structure and demographic connectivity has not yet been made at a large scale. A common set of microsatellite markers was used in this study to provide the first comprehensive estimate of genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins in European Atlantic waters. As in previous studies, a high level of genetic differentiation was found between coastal and pelagic populations. Genetic structure was defined at an unprecedented fine-scale level for coastal dolphins, leading to identification of five distinct coastal populations inhabiting the following areas: Shannon estuary, west coast of Ireland, English Channel, coastal Galicia, east coast of Scotland and Wales/west Scotland. Demographic connectivity was very low among most populations with <10% migration rate, suggesting no demographic coupling among them. Each local population should therefore be monitored separately. The results of this study have the potential to be used to identify management units for bottlenose dolphins in this region and thus offer a significant contribution to the conservation of the species in European Atlantic waters. Future studies should prioritize obtaining biopsies from free-living dolphins from areas where only samples from stranded animals were available, i.e. Wales, west Scotland and Galicia, in order to reduce uncertainty caused by sample origin doubt, as well as from areas not included in this study (e.g. Iroise Sea, France).

While the density of some fish species may increase following coral loss, most species decline. Determining which species are 'winners' and 'losers' following disturbances is fundamental to inform projections of future reef community structure, biodiversity, and productivity. Here, we analyse a long-term (2006-2018), spatially extensive (approximate to 700 km) 'natural experiment' in which the responses of 11 wrasse taxa to acute disturbance events and no-take marine reserve (NTMR) protection were quantified on fringing coral reefs in the Palm (18 degrees 34 ' S, 146 degrees 29 ' E), Whitsunday (20 degrees 08 ' S, 148 degrees 56 ' E), and Keppel Island (23 degrees 10 ' S, 150 degrees 57 ' E) groups, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The responses of wrasse densities to benthic habitat change were taxa specific and temporally consistent. Disturbance-mediated reductions in live hard coral cover and/or habitat complexity resulted in density declines for Hemigymnus melapterus, Hemigymnus fasciatus, Cheilinus fasciatus, Labroides spp., Oxycheilinus digramma, and Thalassoma spp. Conversely, Halichoeres spp. densities correlated positively with increased relative cover of sand and rubble, while Stethojulis spp., Anampses spp., Epibulus insidiator, and Bodianus spp. displayed variable responses to habitat changes. No wrasses exhibited an NTMR effect and predator density, irrespective of NTMR status, only influenced five taxa across all island groups.

However, empirical evidence for effective resilience management is still limited. To inform effective management strategies, mechanisms that underlie resilience to global change that can be influenced by management-ready actions must be identified and tested through observations, experiments, and modeling.

Marine reserves have become important tools in mitigating these pressures, and one of the most critical factors in determining their spatial design is the degree of connectivity among populations. However, the spatial scale and strength at which populations are potentially connected by dispersal remain uncertain. In this paper, the potential connectivity of corals was assessed through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those reefs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Western Indian Ocean coral reefs formed about 13 clusters for larvae with short pelagic larval duration (PLD; 5 days) but grouped into stable larger clusters at 15, 30, and 60 days PLDs, with strong westward dispersal from the northern tip of Madagascar and Comoro Islands toward the East African coast. Reefs at Mafia-Latham Island (Tanzania), Angoche-Nacala and Pemba-Mucufi (Mozambique), Anjouan and Ngazidja (Comoros), and Glorieuses (France) were the most significant for multigenerational connectivity, as measured by betweenness centrality. The small islands Agalega and Tromelin were completely disconnected from other sites at all PLDs. These findings identify priority conservation areas and actions to help support coral reef resilience through a connected network of marine protected areas.Plain Language Summary Given that the health of coral reefs have declined due to a combination of global and local stressors, managing this ecosystem and associated resources is crucial. The establishment of marine protected areas is one widely used conservation instrument. This study assesses the potential connectivity of coral reefs within the Western Indian Ocean region using a biophysical model (i.e., a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled with an ocean circulation numerical model). The results show that coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean form a relatively well connected network, with reefs at Mafia-Latham Island (Tanzania), Angoche-Nacala and Pemba-Mucufi (Mozambique), Anjouan and Ngazidja (Comoros), and Glorieuses (France) being the most significant for multigenerational connectivity.

In response, managers and scientists aim to recreate grassland habitat, yet these reconstructed grasslands are often species-poor and lose diversity through time. One potential mechanism to promote biodiversity in grasslands is spillover, or the targeted dispersal of species across habitat boundaries from areas of high to low biodiversity. There is potential for native species to disperse via spillover from high-quality remnant habitat and establish in reconstructions, thus increasing biodiversity. However, plant dispersal and establishment are often context dependent, and the conditions that promote spillover in grasslands are largely unknown. Here we examine the contexts under which spillover can enhance biodiversity in grasslands. Specifically, we investigate whether the species richness of reconstructions and individual plant dispersal traits alter spillover. To do so, we surveyed plant species richness at reconstructed grasslands of varying diversity adjacent to remnant grasslands. We found that spillover from remnants supplies reconstructions with rare species that would otherwise not be present, but only in reconstructions with lower overall richness. Furthermore, spillover was more likely to occur for species with wind dispersed seeds than species with unassisted seed dispersal. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the context dependency of both dispersal and establishment processes are critical to understanding when and where spillover can promote biodiversity in reconstructed systems. Understanding these contexts will help land managers leverage natural dispersal to mitigate biodiversity loss by anticipating which species are likely to arrive in reconstructions without assistance and when they are likely to establish.",5,2019,10.1111/1365-2664.13469,WOS:000479864300001,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

Strengthening management measures necessitate understanding the variability of larval connectivity and bridging global connectivity models to local scales. An individual-based Lagrangian biophysical model was used to simulate connectivity between coral reefs for three organisms with different early life history characteristics: a coral (Acropora millepora), a sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla), and a reef fish (Epinephelussp). Connectivity metrics and reef clusters were computed from the settlement probability matrices. Fitted power law functions derived from the dispersal kernels provided relative probabilities of connection given only the distance between reefs, and demonstrated that 95% of the larvae across organisms settled within a third of their maximum settlement distances. The magnitude of the connectivity metric values of reef cells were sensitive to differences both in the type of organism and temporal variability. Seasonal variability of connections was more dominant than interannual variability. However, despite these differences, the moderate to high correlation of metrics between organisms and seasonal matrices suggest that the spatial patterns are relatively similar between reefs. A cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity of sink and source connections synthesized the inherent variability of these multiple large connectivity matrices. Through this, similarities in regional connectivity patterns were determined at various cluster sizes depending on the scale of interest. The validity of the model is supported by 1) the simulated dispersal kernels being within the range of reported parentage analysis estimates; and, 2) the clusters that emerged reflect the dispersal barriers implied by previously published population genetics studies.

MPAs are expected to replenish nearby exploited populations through the natural dispersal of young, but the models that make these predictions rely on assumptions that have recently been demonstrated to be incorrect for most species of fish. A meta-analysis showed that fish reproductive output scales hyperallometrically with fish mass, such that larger fish produce more offspring per unit body mass than smaller fish.

For this reason, the European Union Habitat Directive included them among priority habitats to be preserved. Although their ecological role is well established, connectivity patterns are still poorly investigated, representing a limit in conservation planning. The present study pioneers a novel approach for the analysis of connectivity in marine bioconstructor species, which often lack suitable genetic markers, by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques. We assess the geographical patterns of genomic variation of the sunset cup coral Leptopsammia pruvoti Lacaze-Duthiers, 1897, an ahermatypic, non-zooxanthellate and solitary scleractinian coral species common in coralligenous habitats and distributed across the Mediterranean Sea. Location The Italian coastline (Western and Central Mediterranean). Methods We applied the restriction site-associated 2b-RAD approach to genotype over 1,000 high-quality and filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 population samples. Results The results revealed the existence of a strongly supported genetic structure, with highly significant pairwise F-ST values between all the population samples, including those collected about 5 km apart from each other. Moreover, genomic data indicate that the strongest barriers to gene flow are between the western (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian Sea) and the eastern side (Adriatic Sea) of the Italian peninsula. Main conclusions The strong differentiation found in L. pruvoti is similar to that found in other species of marine bioconstructors investigated in this area, but it strongly contrasts with the small differences found in many fish and invertebrates at the same geographical scale. All in one, our results highlight the importance of assessing connectivity in species belonging to coralligenous habitats as, due to their limited dispersal ability, they might require specific spatial conservation measures.",6,2019,10.1111/ddi.12918,WOS:000472770700008,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,assesses genetic structuring but not role of MPA

However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population.

The analysis was based on a particle tracking model incorporating four years of daily horizontal surface currents from the global scale HYCOM 1/12 degrees. We carried out two approaches, the first one used the period of larval duration (PLD) and the second the time of flexion of the notochord as the limit time of dispersion of the particles. Additionally, peak spawning seasons (December-Febraury for E. striatus and March-July for L. analis), lunar phases and georeferenced spawning aggregations sites were considered for releasing the virtual larvae. Our findings suggest that in general, the network of MPAs of the MBRS are well connected, however, the connectivity network structure presented variations in the relative role of each MPA, and their played role will depend on the specie reproductive period, the oceanographic conditions and the assumed biological approximation (such as PLD or flexion).

Efficacy of MPAs is frequently gauged by measuring the direct ecological responses of fish communities. However measuring the indirect, or knock-on effects from protection can provide additional insight into MPA effectiveness at the community level. Here we applied trait-based and community analyses to investigate MPA effectiveness by evaluating both direct and indirect effects of protection on fish assemblages using baited remote underwater stereo-video data from inside and outside 5 no-take MPAs along the South African coastline. The trait-based analyses indicated the presence of a significant overall direct effect (increased abundance of mature individuals targeted by fisheries) and indirect effects (reduction of the abundance of species not targeted by fisheries) inside MPAs, and highlighted that fish maturity is an essential trait to incorporate when assessing direct effects of protection. However, investigation of the species data of the individual MPAs showed positive reserve effects at the community level (both direct and indirect effects) in only 3 MPAs. For the most part these results conform with current theories on the factors that contribute to MPA effectiveness. Yet, one old, large and isolated no-take MPA showed no direct effects of protection, which is attributed to the lack of adequate offshore reef habitat throughout this MPA.

However, the distribution of MPAs in the Brazilian EEZ is still unbalanced regarding the proportion of protected ecosystems, protection goals and management types. Moreover, the demographic connectivity between these MPAs and their effectiveness regarding the maintenance of biodiversity are still not comprehensively understood. An individual-based modeling scheme coupled with a regional hydrodynamic model of the ocean is used to determine the demographic connectivity of reef fishes based on the widespread genus Sparisoma found in the oceanic islands and on the Brazilian continental shelf between 10 degrees N and 23 degrees S. Model results indicate that MPAs are highly isolated due to extremely low demographic connectivity. Consequently, low connectivity and the long distances separating MPAs contribute to their isolation. Therefore, the current MPA design falls short of its goal of maintaining the demographic connectivity of Sparisoma populations living within these areas. In an extreme scenario in which the MPAs rely solely on protected populations for recruits, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively contribute to the resilience of these populations or other reef fish species sharing the same dispersal abilities.

For ARs to function as substitute habitat for degraded natural reefs, they should perform as dose as possible to local natural reefs, however this is seldom investigated. Here we evaluated the performance of new custom-designed reef structures (CDARs) as fish habitat. As a benchmark for their success, we compared fish abundance, diversity and community composition on CDARs to another commonly used AR type (Reef Balls (RBs)) and nearby natural reefs. Fish were monitored on all reef types over two recruitment seasons at three locations in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Overall, there were no consistent differences in fish density among reef types, although densities on both AR designs were markedly lower than natural reefs at some locations. However, fish species richness on the CDARs was, on average, 2x higher than natural or RB reefs. There were large dissimilarities in fish community composition among reef types across all locations and years. These dissimilarities declined over time with the CDARs becoming more similar to natural communities than to RB reefs. Our results suggest that CDARs can play a role in reef fish conservation where natural reefs are under threat, supporting natural community structure and enhancing local biodiversity. Overall, our findings suggest that la cation of deployment, rather than design, has a more significant influence on fish abundances on ARs, whereas reef design is an important determinant of species diversity and community structure irrespective of location. ARs represent an important management tool for enhancing fisheries productivity and conservation in areas where reef habitat has been degraded or lost. However, failure to incorporate consideration of reef location and design into future AR deployments may lead to poor performance and failure to achieve restoration or conservation goals.

Sustainable ocean development in the Faroe-Shetland Channel Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (FSC NCMPA; northeast Atlantic), which harbors sponge aggregations, now requires adaptive management in the face of encroachment of multisectorial activities in this area (e.g., fishing, oil and gas, shipping) and climate change. We examined sponge morphotype composition, richness, diversity, density and body-size distribution inside and outside the FSC NCMPA, and the role of environmental variability and human impact in these sponge aggregations. Analyses were based on the examination of 465 high resolution images from 13 towed-camera transects. A catalog for regional sponge morphotypes was also developed and applied for these analyses. Analysis revealed that morphotype composition did not differ between inside and outside the FSC NCMPA but richness, diversity and densities of massive/spherical/papillate and flabellate/caliculate sponges were higher inside than outside the boundary. The sponge aggregations occurred within a narrow zone between 450 and 530 m depth, within relatively warm and saline water masses. Furthermore, multiple size cohorts of sponges were recorded inside the FSC NCMPA, in contrast to the single cohort outside. Distance-based linear modeling showed that demersal fisheries, substratum, salinity and temperature explained a statistically-significant amount of variation (48%, p < 0.001) of sponge density across the study area. Findings on density and size cohorts suggest that the FSC NCMPA boundary currently encloses the most vulnerable area, which also demonstrates normal ecosystem functions (e.g., recruitment). However, sponges were constrained to a narrow environmental niche shaped by fisheries and interactions of FSC NCMPA water masses with the slope that in turn likely determine, food supply to the sponge aggregations. Our study illustrated the vulnerability of the FSC NCMPA sponge aggregations to fisheries and changes to water mass properties over time.

Up to now, studies on gorgonian ecology in the Mediterranean Sea have been focused mainly on the SCUBA diving depth range. Although increased availability of remotely operated vehicles allowed access to the deeper areas, gorgonian assemblages located on continental shelf and slopes are still barely known. Gorgonian assemblages on continental shelves are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, especially bottom trawling and longline fishing. To implement effective management and conservation policies it is crucial to understand patterns of genetic structure among populations since connectivity enhances the resilience of populations. Paramuricea macrospina is a key structuring gorgonian in the Menorca Channel's (Balearic Archipelago) outer continental shelf where it covers vast extensions, reaching very high densities. Combining two mitochondrial makers and 10 microsatellites, this study gives the first insight into the genetic diversity and population structure of P. macrospina between 60 and 100 m depth in the Menorca Channel and at a horizontal spatial scale of about 60 Km. Overall, we demonstrate a low genetic diversity and a lack of genetic structure among populations, which may be explained by the geomorphology and hydrodynamic features of the Menorca Channel (e.g. internal waves, high currents). Our study suggests some connectivity among P. macrospina populations in accordance with the high recruitment rates observed. This connectivity may increase the resilience and foster the recovery of impacted populations since the study area will become a Marine Protected Area of the Natura 2000 network in the near future.

Central sites act as sources, while northern sites are sinks; the main source of migrants was the southern-most site.

We also found that the largest marine reserves (>1000 km(2)) are the most isolated. These findings have important implications for the assessment of evolutionary, ecological, and socio-economic long-distance benefits of marine reserves.

Here, we analyzed the patterns of genetic variability in the marine snail Gibbula divaricata from five coastal locations in the central-south Adriatic Sea (central Mediterranean) and one in the adjacent northern Ionian Sea, using 21 described polymorphic microsatellite loci. Observed and expected heterozygosity varied from 0.582 to 0.635 and 0.684 to 0.780, respectively. AMOVA analyses showed that 97% of genetic variation was observed within populations. Nevertheless, significant, although small, genetic differentiation was found among nearly all of the pairwise F-ST comparisons. Over a general pattern of panmixia, three groups of populations were identified: eastern Adriatic populations, western Adriatic populations, and a third group represented by the single northern Ionian Sea population. Nonetheless, migration and gene flow were significant between these groups. Gibbula divaricata is thought to have a limited dispersal capacity related to its lecithotrophic trochophore larval stage. Our results indicated high levels of self-recruitment and gene flow that is mainly driven through coastline dispersion, with populations separated by the lack of suitable habitats or deep waters. This stepping-stone mode of dispersion together with the high levels of self-recruitment could lead to higher levels of population structuring and differentiation along the Adriatic Sea. Large effective population sizes and episodic events of long-distance dispersal might be responsible for the weak differentiation observed in the analyzed populations. In summary, the circulation system operating in this region creates natural barriers for dispersion that, together with life-history traits and habitat requirements, certainly affect connectivity in G. divaricata. However, this scenario of potential differentiation seems to be overridden by sporadic events of long-distance dispersal across barriers and large effective population sizes.",3,2019,10.3389/fgene.2019.00177,WOS:000460878400001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

Although metapopulation theory predicts how stochastic dispersal can alter the stability of metapopulations, little is known about how dispersal-related traits such as spawning time and larval duration interact with spatiotemporal connectivity to affect metapopulation growth and stability. We used stochastic models and stage-structured metapopulation dynamics to study the interacting effects of ocean currents and dispersal traits on regional growth and stability. We derived stochastic metapopulation growth and stability, which predict the strong impact of local density regulation on the response of metapopulation to dynamic connectivity: temporal variance, positive (negative) covariance, and negative (positive) autocorrelation in connectivity deflate (inflate) density-independent growth. Yet, stability decreases (increases) with temporal variance and positive (negative) covariance of connectivity. We applied our derived metrics to simulated connectivity along the coast of British Colombia (Canada) over a range of spawning time (ST) and pelagic larval duration (PLD). Our analysis shows strong interactions between statistical components of connectivity, dispersal-related traits, and metapopulation growth and stability. The non-monotonic response of metapopulation stability to PLD was driven by mean of connectivity over short PLDs (<36 days), with a decrease in mean connectivity and stability with PLD. Over longer PLDs, temporal variance in connectivity had a dominant effect, with both a decrease in temporal variance of connectivity and an increase stability with PLDs > 36 days. We therefore use a trait-based framework and partitioning the relative importance of spatial and temporal components of stochastic marine dispersal, to inform species response through climate-induced changes in larval transport and in dispersal-related traits.",5,2019,10.1007/s12080-018-0393-0,WOS:000459514000009,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

Recently, extremely high abundances of Atlantic sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus have persisted over a wide range of their distribution, including 2 adjacent areas on Browns Bank, Canada, that were closed to fishing from 2014 to 2016. We hypothesized that the closures, named C2 and C3, would work as expected, i.e. scallop abundance would decrease through time due to natural mortality, while yield would substantially increase due to growth. To test this, we compared the density (number of scallops per unit area), crowding levels (number of scallops around an individual scallop), and shell growth of scallops through the closures. Despite similar scallop densities in each area, crowding levels were significantly higher within area C2 than in C3. This contrasting result suggests the intensity of scallop aggregation was significantly higher in area C2. This area also had individuals with reduced shell height growth in the final year of the closure. Combined, the results show yield was lost between Years 2 and 3 in area C2 while yield increased through time in area C3. The different levels of crowding between the 2 areas may explain the different growth patterns; factors causing discrepancies in scallop growth can be related to aggregation intensity.

We captured over 7000 Bonefish via seine netting, marked them with dart tags, and relied on fishing guides and anglers to report recaptures on Abaco, Grand Bahama, and Andros. Mark-recapture results from the three islands showed that 60-80% of Bonefish were recaptured within 5km of their tagging site. Across the three islands, mean distance between mark and recapture was less than 11km, suggesting space use that is tractable for effective marine reserve implementation. We also found that pre-spawning sites housed individuals from multiple homesites that were separated by distances up to 75km. With these connections in mind, conserving Bonefish spawning biomass necessitates habitat protection in multiple home areas, along migratory corridors, and at pre-spawn and spawning locations.

With the recent development of fine-scale acoustic tracking, ecologists and fishery managers have gained a powerful tool to explore how exploited species behave in newly created artificial habitats. Here, we report for the first time the space used by the black scorpionfish (Scorpaena porcus) and red scorpionfish (Scorpaena scrofa), two highly important exploited species in the Mediterranean Sea that are often managed with ARs. The Vemco VR2W positioning system (VPS) was used to examine the fine-scale movement patterns (home range) and residency time of these species. S. porcus (182-271 mm total length; n = 14) and S. scrofa (252-445 mm total length; n = 7) were tracked for up to 91 d in ARs located in Edremit Bay, northern Aegean Sea, Turkey. The results revealed high site fidelity during the tracking period and high variability (among individuals) in their home range areas, which ranged from 933 m(2) to 28,674 m(2) (Kernel Utilization Distribution 95%) for S. porcus and from 1895 m(2) to 17,487 m(2) for S. scrofa, with a mean and s.d. of 9591 +/- 8998 m(2) and 8104 +/- 6113 m(2), respectively. The variability in the home range areas was explained neither by the fish length nor diel phase (day vs. night), although residency indexes suggested stronger site fidelity in large S. scrofa. While the lack of size-dependent home range behavior could be explained by the limited size of the range (imposed by the telemetry system), the lack of diel differences in their home range sizes could be explained by the ambush predatory behavior of both species. Our findings suggested that ARs may facilitate the profitability of fisheries in both species by retaining adults and enhancing recruitment of newly settled fish, as suggested by the movement patterns and habitat utilization indexes considered in this study.",4,2019,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.10.008,WOS:000451934800003,model?,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

However, these studies beg the question as to how the selection imposed by harvesting and the dispersal rates between two patches influence stock abundance and the maximum fishery yield from the perspective of mathematical model. In this paper, a prey-predator model with selective harvesting by incorporating two discrete state delays in age and size for both the species in unreserve area has been established. Considering the resources exploitation and ecological observation, a hybrid optimal problem with Lagrange function and state delays together with characteristic times is formulated. We then develop an efficient numerical method by the lights of optimal state delay control method and Pontryagin-type minimum (maximum) principle. Finally, we discuss the impacts of selection for harvesting ages and efforts as well as migration coefficients on the fishery abundance and maximal yield by a series of simulations. Our results manifest: (1) after establishing protected areas, the oscillating amplitudes of prey and predator in unprotected areas are lessened and the stocks of predator in both areas are greatly enhanced with increasing of dispersal rates. (2) selective harvest tactics is appropriate for the strong intensity harvest in order to increase the abundance of all populations; (3) at the specific ages, optimal harvest efforts can enhance greatly fishery yield for the harvested population. However, the too late harvest for populations can reduce fishery sustainable yield, and this undesirable effects should be considered alongside harvest efforts when developing hunting regulations or policies; (4) the appropriate age selections will bring about the higher yield when the over-exploitation is implemented; (5) creating reserved areas only for preys greatly enhances fishery stocks and the sustainable yield than the other two patterns. However, setting reserved areas merely for the predator population is undesirable for increasing the fishery stock and yield.

However, before-after control-impact studies that explore the biological and fishery effects of MPAs to surrounding fisheries are scarce. We present results from a fine-scale spatial gradient study conducted before and after the implementation of a 5 km(2) lobster MPA in southern Norway. A significant nonlinear response in lobster abundance, estimated as catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from experimental fishing, was detected within 2 years of protection. After 4 years, CPUE values inside the MPA had increased by a magnitude of 2.6 compared to before-protection values. CPUE showed a significant nonlinear decline from the centre of the MPA, with a depression immediately outside the border and a plateau in fished areas. Overall fishing pressure almost doubled over the course of the study. The highest increase in fishing pressure (by a magnitude of 3) was recorded within 1 km of the MPA border, providing a plausible cause for the depression in CPUE. Taken together, these results demonstrate the need to regulate fishing pressure in surrounding areas when MPAs are implemented as fishery management tools.",10,2019,10.1098/rspb.2018.2455,WOS:000465428900023,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Average shell length in a population was not related to FP, but shell lip thickness (an index of conch age) declined significantly with FP. Repeated surveys in three fishing grounds revealed that densities of mature conch have declined in all of those locations and the populations have become younger with time. Densities have also declined significantly in three repeated surveys (over 22 years) conducted in a large no-take fishery reserve. Unlike fished populations, the protected population has aged and appears to be declining for lack of recruitment. In all fishing grounds except those most lightly fished, densities of adult conch are now below that needed for successful mating and reproduction.

Ecological connectivity governs the exchange of individuals among spatially fragmented habitats and is often highlighted as an important element in the design of MPAs. However, the degree to which measured or modelled representations of connectivity are applied to marine management decisions worldwide remains unclear. We reviewed the scientific and management literature to explore the application of connectivity in MPAs located in six countries or regions with advanced marine spatial planning. Only 11% of the 746 MPAs we examined considered connectivity as an ecological criterion, increasingly so since 2007. Landscape measures such as habitat linkages were used most frequently by managers and genetic and modelling approaches by scientists. Of the MPAs that considered connectivity, 71% were for state marine conservation areas or reserves in California and commonwealth marine reserves in Australia. This pattern indicates substantial geographic bias. We propose that the incorporation of connectivity in conservation planning needs to become more accessible to practitioners and provide four recommendations that together will allow scientists and managers to bridge this gap: 1. determine whether to prioritize connectivity as an ecological criterion, 2. identify the role of an MPA in supporting connectivity, 3. identify the appropriate spatial and temporal scale of connectivity, and 4. improve regional knowledge of connectivity patterns. We also propose a framework to facilitate the communication of metrics and patterns of connectivity between scientists and practitioners to apply the best available information in the design and adaptive management of MPAs and networks of MPAs.

Larval transport information is available at annual and decadal scales for eight Cuban sites for five species of snappers. Connectivity patterns were examined: (a) within Cuban regions, (b) among Cuban regions, and (c) among other countries. We compared this information with the distribution of protected areas relative to spawning sites, site management attributes, and potential alternatives. Of eight focal spawning sites, seven are in protected areas and one is proposed. Southeast and north-central Cuba had highest estimated within-region retention levels. Southwest and northwest sites exported relatively more larvae out-of-region. Southern regions produced larvae that reached Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Haiti. All northern regions can export larvae to the southern Bahamas. The regions and sites within are geomorphologically diverse with variable fishing and socio-economic attributes. Information on stock status and protected area efficacy is limited and field assessments of aggregation status are needed for multispecies spawning sites.

Yet, while these mega-reserves have collectively made a major contribution toward meeting global targets for marine conservation, their effectiveness for the protection of highly mobile, pelagic species remains largely unknown. This study reports on the spatial behavior and reproductive status of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) inhabiting a proposed LSMPA around Ascension Island (tropical Atlantic), with the aim of evaluating the conservation benefits for this economically important species. Using a combination of satellite archival tags and conventional mark-recapture it was shown that individual tuna can remain within Ascension Island waters for periods of between 100 and 200 days, with core residency areas (50% utilization distributions) generally extending <200 km from shore. The vast majority of activity occurred within 92.6 km (50 nmi) of the island and coincided with a no-take zone established around the island in 2016. However, dispersive movements out of this zone were observed in some satellite-tagged individuals, possibly marking the beginning of more extensive oceanic migrations. Gonad staging of 342 individuals sampled over a 32 month period found no evidence of reproductively active (ripe) individuals, strongly suggesting that tuna foraging around Ascension Island migrate elsewhere to breed. Study results provide further evidence of the importance of oceanic islands as residency areas for pelagic megafauna, helping to justify their inclusion within LSMPAs. In the absence of local recruitment, however, these individuals will remain susceptible to exploitation on spawning grounds located outside of reserves, ultimately limiting their effectiveness and thus calling for further research to identify and protect the areas where species are most vulnerable.",11,2018,10.1002/aqc.2936,WOS:000453874900005,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

To investigate genetic connectivity of the depth-generalist coral species Montastraea cavernosa, populations from both shallow (15-30m) and mesophotic coral ecosystems (30-70m) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were analyzed with microsatellite genotyping. A series of upstream and downstream sites were chosen in marine protected areas including Carrie Bow Cay, Belize; Flower Garden Banks and nearby mesophotic bank habitats; Pulley Ridge; and Dry Tortugas. Patterns of genetic diversity within the northwest GOM supported relatively open coral populations with high levels of gene flow between shallow and mesophotic depth zones, consistent with strong oceanographic patterns and hypothesized availability of coral reef habitats in the GOM. Conversely, genetic differentiation within Belize and the southeast GOM indicate relative isolation of shallow and mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in these regions. Structure analysis showed dominant genetic clusters within each region that did not correlate strongly with depth zones, and identified a cluster of unknown origin contributing to high differentiation at Pulley Ridge. Migration modeling predicted historical region-wide panmixia for most regions, with Pulley Ridge appearing to be a potential sink population. The GOM appears to demonstrate stronger evidence of vertical connectivity compared to elsewhere in the Tropical Western Atlantic, which may be the result of oceanographic variability and/or lack of local selection at depth.

However, empirical studies have not supported the expected negative relationship between the local effect and mobility. We propose that differential, habitat-dependent movement (i.e., a higher movement rate in the fishing grounds than in the MPA) might explain the disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results. We evaluate this hypothesis by building two-patch box and stepping-stone models and show that increasing disparity in the habitat-specific movement rates shifts the relationship between the local effect and mobility from negative (the previous theoretical results) to neutral or positive (the empirical pattern). This shift from negative to positive occurs when differential movement offsets recruitment and mortality differences between the two habitats. Thus, local effects of MPAs might be caused by behavioral responses via differential movement rather than by, or in addition to, reductions in mortality. In addition, the benefits of MPAs, in terms of regional abundance and fishing yields, can be altered by the magnitude of differential movement. Thus, our study points to a need for empirical investigations that disentangle the interactions among mobility, differential movement, and protection.",5,2018,10.1002/ecy.2477,WOS:000449937900008,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Anthropogenic activities have caused the degradation of the world's ecosystems, accelerating the loss of biodiversity. In marine ecosystems, fishing has had strong impacts on fish populations and their habitats; however, not all species have responded equally to fishing pressure. 2. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) are of high commercial value throughout the North Atlantic. Despite having relatively similar life cycles, the state of stocks of these three species varies enormously, with whiting faring better than cod. Within the Firth of Clyde (south-west Scotland), this imbalance is especially accentuated, where small whiting now make up the greater proportion of the biomass. 3. In this study, cod, haddock, and whiting recruitment to coastal areas, growth, and bait attraction were explored within a marine protected area (MPA) in the Firth of Clyde. Over the course of the summers of 2013 and 2014, whiting and haddock arrived at coastal areas earlier than cod, and grew more quickly. Cod were on average the smallest gadoid observed, and whiting the largest. Whiting also had more predominant scavenging behaviour. 4. These results, in combination with other life-history traits, indicate that whiting may be at a competitive advantage over cod, and this may partly explain the imbalance of gadoids in the Firth of Clyde. This study highlights the importance of considering life-history differences in multi-species fisheries management, and how appropriately managed MPAs could help to restore fish population and assemblage structure.",2,2018,10.1002/aqc.2926,WOS:000448262100016,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Analyses of FD offer a potentially useful tool to identify functional changes in diverse, complex, and disturbed marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, yet this metric is rarely applied to evaluate community change. Here, we documented spatio-temporal variability in the trophic function of fish assemblages to identify changes in coral reef communities inside the Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) in the U.S. Virgin Islands between 2002 and 2010, which included an intense coral bleaching event in 2005. We combined six trait categories related to the trophic function of 95 fish species together with species biomass estimated from underwater surveys to calculate assemblage-level descriptors of functional richness (FRic), dispersion (FDis), and evenness. We tested the effects of habitat type, time, and their interaction on fish FD using a non-parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance. We found statistically significant differences for FRic and FDis between habitat types and survey years. Coral reef and other hard bottom areas supported highest levels of trophic functional richness and variation, but low functional redundancy. Fish species exhibited high functional uniqueness within the functional trait space suggesting that a significant decline in fish diversity in the BIRNM would likely result in loss of trophic functions from the fish community. Detection of temporal variations in functional trait composition subsequent to the mass coral bleaching event in 2005 indicates that FD descriptors are sensitive enough to track shifts in the emergent trophic organization of fish communities. In the BIRNM, the trophic organization in fish assemblages did not return to the pre-bleaching state even after five years of monitoring. We demonstrate a novel way to monitor resilience to disturbance by plotting and tracking the centroid of the functional trait space through time.

It is well established that habitat restoration results in higher finfish biomass and diversity where oyster reefs replace bare substrata. Therefore, restoring oyster reefs with a view to also improving fish stocks is often a key goal of oyster restoration. However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs. Integrating these ecological and coastal management concepts into oyster reef restoration will enhance outcomes for fishes and increase stakeholder engagement and cost-effectiveness.",21,2018,10.1111/faf.12301,WOS:000443114900013,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,synthetise conditions in which oyster reef can enhance fish recruitment to inform MPA design

We find high site fidelity of individuals within each of these two coastal populations to their respective MPA. We also find low levels of demographic dispersal between the populations, but it remains unclear whether any new gametes are exchanged between populations through these migrants (genetic dispersal).

Patterns of larval connectivity varied both between months and annually but were predominately directed south to north following wind patterns. Predicted self-recruitment was variable, as up to 100% of spat in a given region displayed signatures consistent with natal origin within that same region. Predicted connectivity patterns varied significantly based on atlases generated from outplanting on stationary moorings vs. surface drifters. For example, drifter-predicted connectivity followed biophysical larval dispersal models more closely than mooring-predicted connectivity, while mooring-predicted connectivity displayed a higher diversity in larval sources.

Although spiny lobster subpopulations are highly connected at the basin scale, several nations located in the northern Caribbean and ecoregional networks could persist independently of the larger basin-wide metapopulation. Based on these results, we propose transnational neighborhoods for spiny lobster management. Our analysis suggests that the dynamics and management of those subpopulations neighborhoods are not intrinsically dependent on upstream connectivity even though current rates of upstream larval supply are very high.",5,2018,10.1111/conl.12567,WOS:000446827300008,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

While intuitive that larval supply and settlement rates should be positively correlated, previous studies have demonstrated that many factors, such as competition for limited space on hard substrata, may decouple this relationship. Oculina arbuscula is a temperate, broadcast spawning coral and is the only structurally complex Scleractinian occurring on hard bottom reefs of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), a region located in the North Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern coast of the U.S.A. Planula larvae of this species must settle on hard-bottom substrate that is densely colonized by a diversity of sessile benthic invertebrates, including sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians. To investigate the relative roles of larval supply and competition for space on the recruitment dynamics of O. arbuscula, settlement to and survival on 30 x 30 cm plots was monitored over 5 years on a reef off the coast of Georgia, U.S.A. Treatments consisted of 10 replicates of each of the following: 1) unmanipulated natural substrate, 2) natural substrate initially cleared of encrusting competitors such as sponges and tunicates, and 3) artificial substrate composed of concrete paving tiles. These plots were photographed 3-5 times per year between July 2004 and June 2009. These images showed that O. arbuscula recruits throughout the year in the SAB with a peak in September/October. While recruitment rates were higher than death rates in all treatments and resulted in a net gain of O. arbuscula colonies, recruitment to artificial substrate far-exceeded that found on natural surfaces. The high recruitment rates observed on artificial substrate ruled out the possibility that maintenance of O. arbuscula populations on natural surfaces is limited by larval supply. Competition with other sessile invertebrates, such as ascidians and sponges, also appeared to contribute to differences in recruitment among treatments, however, comparisons between cleared and unmanipulated control plots on natural substrate suggested that the competition effect was small. Based on these findings as well as anecdotal observations suggesting that sediment accumulates less on the artificial substrate, the alternative hypothesis that O. arbuscula populations in this system are controlled by physical factors, especially sedimentation, is proposed and warrants further investigation.",2,2018,10.1016/j.jembe.2018.06.006,WOS:000440960500013,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

However, the connectivity of corals between MPAs is still poorly known, especially in the Marine Conservation Corridor of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (MCCETP). Here, we assess the potential connectivity of corals across equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean-circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those MPAs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Our results show that the equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs form a relatively well-connected network, at least 40% of coral larvae released per year end up within the boundaries of an MPA. MPAs like Malpelo and Gorgona islands included in the MCCETP were found to be critical for connectivity of corals because of their high between-ness centrality and potential role as stepping-stones between coastal MPAs and offshore MPAs such as the Galapagos Islands. Two pelagic larval duration (PLD) scenarios (40 and 130 days) indicate a quasi-unidirectional larval flow from coastal MPAs toward oceanic MPAs, where the only resilient MPAs (Coiba and Malpelo islands) depend mostly on subsidiary recruitment from MPAs located along the coast of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. In the two PLD scenarios, Cocos Island maintains a very low resilience potential. Our results indicate the imperative need to include coastal MPAs in the MCCETP network initiative, since connectivity and resilience of coral reefs in the equatorial eastern Pacific region rely heavily on coastal MPAs.",10,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0202995,WOS:000443071400080,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,only assesses connectivity within the network

Yet, without the ability to demonstrate connectivity, it is impossible to be certain that sites designated within a MPA network do in fact constitute a network, when they may-irrespective of the diversity and rarity of the taxa within them-be in reality a set of unlinked habitats and associated species assemblages. However, the process of assessing connectivity between MPAs, and which taxa to include in assessments of connectivity, is often difficult and can be dependent on a variety of factors that can be outside the control of managers, stakeholders and policymakers. Among the many methods that have been used to assess connectivity, genetic markers are often used to infer connectivity indirectly by estimating the degree of genetic differentiation between populations of a species or by inferring the origin(s) of migrants using assignment methods. While modem molecular methods can be extremely robust and are now routinely used to address conservation issues, genetic data are, to the authors' knowledge, rarely used to inform designation of MPA networks.

In the present study, the level of connectivity of the endemic lobster Panulirus pascuensis Reed, 1954 from remote islands in the southern Pacific Ocean was estimated, focusing on the Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMH), considered here as a source of recruits to Easter Island. The connectivity of adult lobster populations between Eastern Island (EI) and Salas y Gomez Island (SG), in the center of MMH, was studied by quantifying the reciprocal migration rates using variability of microsatellite loci and a biophysical individual-based model of larval transport based on the outputs of a regional high-resolution oceanic model. Considering a system composed only of adult populations located in both islands, the genetic analysis showed that 3% of the adults from EI came from SG; however, only 0.02% in the opposite direction. Neglecting the effect of other islands (e.g., Pitcairn Island located at 2000 km west of EI), the self-recruitment was estimated at 97% in EI and 99.8% in SG. The results of the Lagrangian analysis of the oceanic model simulations are consistent with the concept of asymmetric connectivity, although there is appreciable variation in recruitment among years. Both genetic and oceanographic approaches revealed large variance in connectivity from SG to EI. The asymmetric connectivity from SG to EI emphasizes the importance of the MMH Marine Park for lobster conservation in SG, and that it also supports recruitment of P. pascuensis to EI.",5,2018,10.5343/bms.2017.1114,WOS:000447254900016,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

A FR was implemented on Akumal reef in 2015 limiting fishing for six years with the specific aim of increasing the biomass of commercial and sport-recreational interest fish species. However, no previous reference data were considered to establish an ecological baseline to quantify progress towards this aim, or to implement any other policy necessary to ensure compliance with this objective. To fill this gap, Akumal FR's current level of potential success was assessed (relating reef fish community characteristics and habitat components characteristics). FR's potential success was quantified as low due to the absence of 50% of listed commercial-sport fish species, critical biomass values for recorded species on the list, and generally low reef fish abundance and biomass values. In addition, current habitat condition is critical because of coral-algal phase shift, changes in coral community structure, and loss of reef structure and the associated reefs refuge function for fish species. Considering the performance of existing no-take marine reserves, Akumal low FR's potential success implies that a much longer no-take period (than the established six years), will be necessary to allow reef fish populations to recover biomass and attain functional levels within the ecosystem that could support on-going fishing impact. Based on this, a number of recommendations were established in order to strengthen the management provisions to allow the reef to attain a better condition, including an extension of the no-take period, enforcement of non-extractive uses, and simultaneous implementation of coastal management strategies.",2,2018,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.04.030,WOS:000437057200014,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Quantifying spatial and temporal variation in settlement is therefore important to fully understand population dynamics, inform fisheries management targets, and design effective spatial management strategies. Data on nearshore patterns of fish settlement are lacking for the northern California Current System (CCS), which is characterized by complex oceanographic currents and a seasonal, intermittent upwelling regime. Thus, to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of fish settlement in the northern CCS in relation to oceanographic conditions, we measured settlement of 5 fish taxa to 2 regions of the Oregon coast over 5 settlement seasons (late spring to early fall, 2012-2016). Temporal patterns of settlement reflected taxon-specific degrees of episodic settlement, with cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus exhibiting the most uniform settlement across each season, and splitnose Sebastes diploproa and redbanded S. babcocki rockfishes exhibiting the most episodic settlement. Fish settlement tended to be greater during short periods of downwelling (upwelling relaxation events) for all but the largest fish taxa. Within settlement season, variation in size-at-settlement tracked taxon-specific temporal patterns of arrival but was unrelated to water temperature. Differences in fish settlement between small marine reserves and nearby unprotected areas was region- and taxon-specific, highlighting the fact that size and habitat heterogeneity should be considered in the design of marine reserves.

In order to manage these species as effectively as possible (e.g., by designing and implementing effective networks of marine protected areas), we must know how many offspring are produced within each local population (i.e., local demography), and where those offspring disperse (i.e., larval connectivity). Although there is much interest in estimating connectivity in the relatively simple sense of identifying the locations of spawning parents and their settling offspring, true measures of demographic connectivity that account for among-site variation in offspring production have been lacking. We combined detailed studies of local reproductive output and larval dispersal of a coral reef fish to quantify demographic connectivity within a regional metapopulation that included four widely spaced islands in the Bahamas. We present a new method for estimating demographic connectivity when the levels of dispersal among populations are inferred by the collection of genetically tagged offspring. We estimated that 13.3% of recruits returned to natal islands, on average (95% CI = 1.1-50.3%), that local retention was high on one of the islands (41%, 95% CI = 6.0-97.0%), and that larval connectivity was appreciable, even between islands 129km apart (mean = 1.6%, 95% CI = 0.20-8.8%). Our results emphasize the importance of properly integrating measurements of production with measurements of connectivity. Had we not accounted for among-site variation in offspring production, our estimates of connectivity would have been inaccurate by a factor as much as 6.5. At a generational timescale, lifetime offspring production varied substantially (a fivefold difference among islands) and the importance of each island to long-term metapopulation growth was dictated by both larval production and connectivity. At the scale of our study (local populations inhabiting 5-ha reefs), the regional metapopulation could not grow without external input. However, an exploratory analysis simulating a network of four marine protected areas suggested that reserves of >65ha each would ensure persistence of this network.

However, many reserves are characterized by several problems mainly related to inadequate zonings that often do not protect high biodiversity and propagule supply areas precluding, at the same time, economic important zones for local interests. The Gulf of Naples is here employed as a study area to assess the effects of inclusion of different conservation features and costs in reserve design process. In particular eight scenarios are developed using graph theory to identify propagule source patches and fishing and exploitation activities as costs-in-use for local population. Scenarios elaborated by MARXAN, software commonly used for marine conservation planning, are compared using multivariate analyses (MDS, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP) in order to assess input data having greatest effects on protected areas selection.MARXAN is heuristic software able to give a number of different correct results, all of them near to the best solution. Its outputs show that the most important areas to be protected, in order to ensure long-term habitat life and adequate propagule supply, are mainly located around the Gulf islands. In addition through statistical analyses it allowed us to prove that different choices on conservation features lead to statistically different scenarios. The presence of propagule supply patches forces MARXAN to select almost the same areas to protect decreasingly different MARXAN results and, thus, choices for reserves area selection.The multivariate analyses applied here to marine spatial planning proved to be very helpful allowing to identify i) how different scenario input data affect MARXAN and ii) what features have to be taken into account in study areas characterized by peculiar biological and economic interests.

The use of reserves as conservation tools is widespread. However, evaluating the effectiveness of reserve implementation for long-lived species has been problematic as it requires sampling programmes over long timescales that are appropriate to species' longevity and recovery rates. In the sea, towed bottom fishing gears alter the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by benthic communities and habitats. Marine reserves have been used to manage these impacts but our understanding of the drivers of their effectiveness for the conservation of temperate reefs is incomplete.2. We examined the effectiveness of marine reserves for recovery of temperate reef fauna in relation to their life history. We used an underwater video to sample six species with different life histories across 60 sites that varied in the duration of protection from towed mobile fishing gear at 0, 1, 8 and 10 years.3. Species with a high dispersal potential and less habitat specific requirements such as soft corals and king scallops recovered to close to their carrying capacity in < 3 years. In contrast, the longer-lived Ross coral and pink seafans increased in abundance but had not fully recovered; with their projected recovery time being 17-20 years.4. Ongoing recovery was evident for long-lived species as their mean body size increased significantly across all treatments, whereas shorter-lived species such as queen scallops did not change in size and were assumed to have fully recovered.5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the recovery rates of biota depend on life-history factors, such as larval longevity and dispersal potential. Recovery for species that had low dispersal potential and specific habitat requirements was slow and could take > 20 years. This suggests activities such as bottom trawling or dredging should be avoided where such species occur if their conservation is an objective. In contrast, species with high dispersal potential and less habitat specific requirements had shorter recovery timescales of c. 2-3 years and would be more amenable to managed trawl frequencies in areas where activities such as fishing occur.",15,2018,10.1111/1365-2664.13087,WOS:000430059500003,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Here, we review the genetic patterns and processes that shape the natural populations of marine organisms in Cuba, including penaeid shrimps, reef fishes, marine turtles, and bottlenose dolphins. Investigations performed over the last 20 yrs indicate three general patterns of population structure across the Cuban coast: a north-south break, an east-west split in the south, and local genetic differentiation. These patterns have been shaped by factors that include the size of the island, current patterns, lack of suitable habitats for reproduction, larval recruitment, and foraging behaviors. No single trait can predict dispersal and population structure across these diverse groups, but in every case, there are key life-history features that guide connectivity. These include limited larval dispersal in damselfishes and shrimps, social structure in dolphins, and natal homing in marine turtles.

Because this phase is difficult to observe directly, it is frequently simulated through numerical models, most of which consider larvae as passive or only vertically migrating. However, in several locations, including the Mediterranean Sea, many species have been shown to swim fast and orient. Here we use a Lagrangian model to study connectivity patterns among three Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and compare simulations in which virtual larvae are passive to simulations in which oriented swimming is implemented. The parameterization of behavior is based on observations for two groups of species of the family Sparidae: species with small larvae (i.e., 9-11 mm), displaying a maximum swimming speed of 6cm s(-1) and a pelagic larval duration of 13-19 days (e.g., Diplodus annularis L., Oblade melanura L.) and species with large larvae (i.e., 14-16 mm), displaying a maximum swimming speed of 10 cm s(-1) and a PLD of 28-38 days (e.g., Spondyliosoma cantharus L.). Including larval behavior in the model (i) increased the overall proportion of successful settlers, (ii) enhanced self-recruitment within the MPAs, but also (iii) increased the intensity, and (iv) widened the export of eggs and larvae (recruitment subsidy) from the MPAs; overall, it significantly changed connectivity patterns.

With at least three main species targeted by artisanal fisheries in the region with distinct life histories, the lack of basic biological information about the distribution, metapopulation size and structure of each species could impede effective fisheries management to avoid overexploitation. We tested if different life histories of three species of octopus could help predict observed patterns of genetic diversity, population dynamics, structure and connectivity and how this information could be relevant to the sustainable management of the fishery. We sequenced two mitochondrial genes and genotyped seven nuclear microsatellite loci to identify the distribution of each species in 20 locations from the Gulf of California and the west coast of the Baja California peninsula. We tested five hypotheses derived from population genetic theory based on differences in the fecundity and dispersal potential for each species. We discovered that Octopus bimaculoides with low fecundity and direct development (without a planktonic phase) had lower average effective population size and genetic diversity, but higher levels of kinship, population structure, and richness of private alleles, than the other two species. These features indicated limited dispersal and high local recruitment. In contrast, O. bimaculatus and O. hubbsorum with higher fecundity and planktonic phase as paralarvae had higher effective population size and genetic diversity, and overall lower kinship and population structure than O. bimaculoides. These observations supported higher levels of gene flow over a larger geographical scale. O. bimaculatus with the longest planktonic paralarval duration and therefore larger dispersal potential had differences in the calculated parameters possibly associated with increased connectivity. We propose O. bimaculoides is more susceptible to over exploitation of small, isolated populations and could have longer recovery times than the other two species. This species may benefit from distinct fishery management within each local population. O. bimaculatus and O. hubbsorum may benefit from fishery management that takes into account metapopulation structure over larger geographic scales and the directionality and magnitude of larval dispersal driven by ocean currents and population connectivity among individuals of each locality. The distribution of each species and variations in their reproductive phenology is also important to consider when establishing marine reserves or seasonal fishing closures.",10,2018,10.7717/peerj.4295,WOS:000425362200001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not about effect of MPA on connectivity

Achieving these goals requires well-connected networks of marine reserves that maximize larval connectivity, thus allowing exchanges between populations and recolonization after local disturbances. However, global warming can disrupt connectivity by shortening potential dispersal pathways through changes in larval physiology. These changes can compromise the performance of marine reserve networks, thus requiring adjusting their design to account for ocean warming. To date, empirical approaches to marine prioritization have not considered larval connectivity as affected by global warming. Here, we develop a framework for designing marine reserve networks that integrates graph theory and changes in larval connectivity due to potential reductions in planktonic larval duration (PLD) associated with ocean warming, given current socioeconomic constraints. Using the Gulf of California as case study, we assess the benefits and costs of adjusting networks to account for connectivity, with and without ocean warming. We compare reserve networks designed to achieve representation of species and ecosystems with networks designed to also maximize connectivity under current and future ocean-warming scenarios. Our results indicate that current larval connectivity could be reduced significantly under ocean warming because of shortened PLDs. Given the potential changes in connectivity, we show that our graph-theoretical approach based on centrality (eigenvector and distance-weighted fragmentation) of habitat patches can help design better-connected marine reserve networks for the future with equivalent costs. We found that maintaining dispersal connectivity incidentally through representation-only reserve design is unlikely, particularly in regions with strong asymmetric patterns of dispersal connectivity. Our results support previous studies suggesting that, given potential reductions in PLD due to ocean warming, future marine reserve networks would require more and/or larger reserves in closer proximity to maintain larval connectivity.",25,2018,10.1111/gcb.13989,WOS:000423994700024,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about impact of climate change on connectivity in MPA networks

Alpine habitats often have a high level of protection, yet extensive environmental heterogeneity and the limited dispersal ability of many endemic species makes it unclear whether PA networks provide sufficient connectivity to protect vulnerable species. We assess landscape connectivity in the European alpine PA network by combining measures of habitat and genetic connectivity using community landscape genetics approaches. Examining 27 plant species, we compare levels of genetic diversity in PA and non-PA sites, and rank non-PA sites for their potential value in facilitating genetic and habitat connectivity, as well as preserving species richness in 893 alpine plants. Non-PA sites do not significantly enhance overall levels of genetic variability across species. However, spatial genetic turnover (allele frequency variation across space) is influenced by geographical and environmental distance, suggesting that genetic connectivity, and by extension landscape connectivity, is impacted by gaps in the PA network. A subset of non-PA sites, when measured for habitat connectivity, genetic connectivity and species richness using spatial graphs, substantially increase landscape connectivity for alpine plants, although there are discrepancies among metrics in ranking sites. We provide the first example of the evaluation and prediction of new PM including levels of intraspecific genetic diversity for a whole community.

Using biophysical modelling and genetic analyses, we assessed potential and realized connectivity among MPA populations of a benthic foundation species, the Mediterranean endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica.Location: Adriatic and Ionian seas (central Mediterranean).Methods: We assessed potential and realized connectivity among eight P.oceanica meadows, mostly located in MPAs. Potential connectivity was assessed over a time horizon of 10years via an individual-based biophysical model whose physical component relies on fine-scale spatio-temporal ocean circulation fields. Genetic assessments of realized connectivity were carried out by means of a set of 14 neutral microsatellite loci, as well as a larger dataset of 19 loci including outlier loci that did not conform to expectations under neutrality.Results: Our findings point out a relatively high potential connectivity through long-range dispersal of floating fruits. Genetic connectivity analyses show a complex scenario with an apparent lower realized connectivity. The P.oceanica meadow within Torre Guaceto MPA (TOG), a well-enforced MPA within our study area, showed one of the highest levels of genotypic richness, indicative of high levels of sexual reproduction and/or recruitment of foreign genotypes.

A comparison of fisheries and conservation objectives in three coastal MPAs in Thailand,.,.,"Mangrove forest ecosystems support aquatic species important to tropical fishing communities, but habitat degradation and over-fishing have caused coastal fishery stocks to decline. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are widely promoted as a management option to reverse this situation. Using swimming crabs as indicator species, this paper explores the ecological effectiveness of two community-led MPAs and one co-managed MPA in Ranong and Phang-nga Provinces in southern Thailand. Comparisons were made of two fisheries objectives: catch per unit effort (CPUE); and size frequency distribution of Portunus spp. and Scylla olivacea; and one conservation objective: catch composition on benthic aquatic species, between each managed area and an associated control site to look for effects of management. Eight replicates of each survey were undertaken in each site: four in the wet season, from May to July 2011; and four in the dry season, from February to March 2012.Two of the MPAs, one a no-take zone and one a gear limitation zone, and both managed by local communities, showed a significant increase in CPUE of target species compared with their controls to the benefit of local fishers. There was little evidence of management impact on the composition of benthic aquatic species so community management is not achieving wider conservation in terms of increased biodiversity. The third MPA, a seasonal no-take zone, co-managed by local communities and local government, showed no significant effect on either CPUE of target species, or composition of benthic aquatic species when compared to its control. For size frequency distribution, a higher abundance of all size classes of Portunus pelagicus was observed in all MPAs compared to their control sites. The size distribution of animals suggests that the community-managed MPAs are supporting recruits and contributing to the fisheries by reducing the rates of growth overfishing. To conclude, the two community-led MPAs benefitted fishers but had no effect on marine biodiversity, while the co-managed MPA did not benefit fishers or marine biodiversity. However, all three MPAs showed increase crab abundance in each size class. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the potential contribution of MPAs to fished populations beyond their boundaries is still highly controversial; empirical measures are scarce and modelling studies have produced a range of predictions, including both positive and negative effects. Using a combination of genetic parentage and relatedness analysis, we measured larval subsidies to local fisheries replenishment for Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus: Sparidae) from a small (5.2 km(2)), well-established, temperate, coastal MPA in northern New Zealand. Adult snapper within the MPA contributed an estimated 10.6% (95% CI: 5.5-18.1%) of newly settled juveniles to surrounding areas (approx. 400 km(2)), with no decreasing trend in contributions up to 40 km away. Biophysical modelling of larval dispersal matched experimental data, showing larvae produced inside the MPA dispersed over a comparable distance. These results demonstrate that temperate MPAs have the potential to provide recruitment subsidies at magnitudes and spatial scales relevant to fisheries management.

Hypotheses about the importance of older female rockfish to population persistence have led to arguments that marine reserves are needed to ensure the sustainability of rockfish populations. However, the implications of these hypotheses for rockfish population dynamics are still unclear. We modeled two mechanisms by which reducing the proportion of older fish in a population has been hypothesized to influence sustainability, and explored whether these mechanisms influenced mean population dynamics and recruitment variability. We explored whether populations with these mechanisms could be managed more sustainably with a marine reserve in addition to a constant fishing mortality rate (F) than with a constant F alone. Both hypotheses can be seen as portfolio effects whereby risk of recruitment failure is spread over a portfolio of maternal ages. First, we modeled a spawning window effect whereby mothers of different ages spawned in different times or locations (windows) with local environmental conditions. Second, we modeled an offspring size effect whereby older mothers produced larger offspring than younger mothers, where length of a starvation period over which offspring could survive increased with maternal age. Recruitment variability resulting from both models was 55-65% lower than for models without maternal age-related portfolio effects in the absence of fishing and increased with increases in Fs for both models. An offspring size effect caused lower output reproductive rates such that the specified reproductive rate input as a model parameter was no longer the realized rate measured as the reproductive rate observed in model results; this quirk is not addressed in previous analyses of offspring size effects. We conducted a standardization such that offspring size effect and control models had the same observed reproductive rates. A comparison of long-term catch, the probability of falling below a biomass threshold, and recruitment variability over a range of exploitation rates for models with an age-related portfolio effect showed no benefit of a marine reserve implemented in addition to a constant F (as compared to a constant F alone) for populations with sedentary adults and sedentary or mobile larvae.",3,2017,10.1002/eap.1593,WOS:000412080200001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

We found lower levels of abundance per anemone in the MPA compared to the fishing zones for both species (n=1,525 anemones, p=.032). The parentage analysis also showed that lower numbers of fishes were recruited from the fishing zones and outside of the study area into each anemone in the MPA than into each anemone in the fishing zones (n=1,525 anemones, p<.017). However, the number of self-recruit production per female did not differ between the MPA and fishing zones (n=384 females, p=.516). Because the ocean currents around the study site were unlikely to cause a lower settlement intensity of larvae in the MPA, the ocean circulation was not considered crucial to the observed abundance and recruitment patterns.

Most small-scale fisheries targets showed increases in density, biomass, or size within the replenishment zone and stable or increasing catch rates beyond replenishment zone boundaries. Lower trophic level, high recruiting species of more limited movement such as parrotfish, conch, and lobster appeared to respond most clearly to protection, while higher trophic level, late maturing, and more widely dispersing snappers and groupers generally displayed more limited recovery. Patterns of mid-trophic level hogfish and queen triggerfish appeared to be linked to the availability of appropriate prey, i.e. conch and urchins respectively, with increasing angelfish catch per unit effort appearing to replace large parrotfish since the ban on harvesting herbivorous fish in 2009. Patterns of triggerfish and angelfish may also be linked to benthic cover, given their preferences for urchins and sponges, respectively.

However, uncertainty about the strength of population connectivity between individual reefs and NTMRs through larval dispersal remains a major obstacle to effective network design. In this study, larval dispersal among NTMRs and fishing grounds in the Philippines was inferred by conducting genetic parentage analysis on a coral-reef fish (Chaetodon vagabundus). Adult and juvenile fish were sampled intensively in an area encompassing approximately 90 km of coastline. Thirty-seven true parent-offspring pairs were accepted after screening 1978 juveniles against 1387 adults. The data showed all types of dispersal connections that may occur in NTMR networks, with assignments suggesting connectivity among NTMRs and fishing grounds (n = 35) far outnumbering those indicating self-recruitment (n = 2). Critically, half (51%) of the inferred occurrences of larval dispersal linked reefs managed by separate, independent municipalities and constituent villages, emphasising the need for nested collaborative management arrangements across management units to sustain NTMR networks. Larval dispersal appeared to be influenced by wind-driven seasonal reversals in the direction of surface currents. The best-fit larval dispersal kernel estimated from the parentage data predicted that 50% of larvae originating from a population would attempt to settle within 33 km, and 95% within 83 km. Mean larval dispersal distance was estimated to be 36.5 km. These results suggest that creating a network of closely spaced (less than a few tens of km apart) NTMRs can enhance recruitment for protected and fished populations throughout the NTMR network.

As these currents often influence dispersal and connectivity among populations of many marine organisms, changes to boundary currents may have dramatic implications for population persistence. Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) often aim to maintain connectivity, but anticipation of the scale and extent of climatic impacts on connectivity are required to achieve this critical conservation goal in a future of climate change. For two key marine species (kelp and sea urchins), we use oceanographic modelling to predict how continental boundary currents are likely to change connectivity among a network of MPAs spanning over 1000 km of coastline off the coast of eastern Australia. Overall change in predicted connectivity among pairs of MPAs within the network did not change significantly over and above temporal variation within climatic scenarios, highlighting the need for future studies to incorporate temporal variation in dispersal to robustly anticipate likely change. However, the intricacies of connectivity between different pairs of MPAs were noteworthy. For kelp, poleward connectivity among pairs of MPAs tended to increase in the future, whereas equatorward connectivity tended to decrease. In contrast, for sea urchins, connectivity among pairs of MPAs generally decreased in both directions. Self-seeding within higher-latitude MPAs tended to increase, and the role of low-latitude MPAs as a sink for urchins changed significantly in contrasting ways. These projected changes have the potential to alter important genetic parameters with implications for adaptation and ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. Considering such changes, in the context of managing and designing MPA networks, may ensure that conservation goals are achieved into the future.",36,2017,10.1111/gcb.13634,WOS:000406812100011,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about impact of climate change on connectivity in MPA networks

To evaluate whether the CCAs affected rockfish productivity we evaluated the dynamics of 8 species that were, and 7 that were not, historically targeted by fishing. Abundances of 6/8 targeted and 4/7 non-targeted species increased regionally from 1998 to 2013.

While recommendations exist for integrating connectivity data into MPA planning, little advice exists on how to assess the connectivity of existing networks. This study makes use of recently observed larval characteristics and freely available models to demonstrate how such an assessment could be undertaken. The cold water coral (CWC) Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) is used as a model species, as much of the NE Atlantic MPA network has been designated for CWC reef protection, but the ecological coherence of the network has yet to be assessed. Simulations are run for different behavioural null models allowing a comparison of 'passive' (current driven) and 'active' (currents + vertical migration) dispersal, while an average prediction is used for MPA assessment. This model suggests that the network may support widespread larval exchange and has good local retention rates but still has room for improvement.

We found that MPAs exchange migrants likely via intermediate unprotected habitats through stepping stone dispersal. At scales > 50 km such connectivity is decreased, particularly across the Mona Passage. The MPA network studied would be unable to maintain connectivity of these small benthic fishes if habitat in between them is extirpated. Our study highlights the power of SNPs to derive effective dispersal distance and the ability of SNPs to make inferences from single individuals.

For most year classes, there was no relationship between the density of YOY and the density of 1 yr olds or the density of adults, and instead habitat variables such as topological complexity and the amount of rocky substrate predicted adult black rockfish abundance. For 1 year class of moderate abundance at the YOY stage but high abundance at the 1 yr old stage, a significant relationship between 1 yr olds and subsequent adults was observed. We surmise that over-winter survival of YOY fish may be an important determinant for year-class strength in black rockfish. Although a companion study found low recruitment of YOY inside the RCA, our data indicate that the density of many species of rockfish was higher inside the RCA.

Further, the remaining conch populations were associated with tidal channels, and these model results agreed with independent observations in 40 km of expanded survey area. Measurements of shell lip thickness, an estimator of relative age, showed an increase relative to 1994 with the greatest effect in 2016, indicating senescence. The ECLSP population appears to be slowly dying of old age, and an early life history process has been altered. Upstream populations have been heavily fished while habitats within the park remain productive, suggesting that low local retention and a lack of exogenous larval sources are driving the decline.

We show that although the estuarine reserves in Moreton Bay contain a significantly different fish community, they fail to enhance the abundance of harvested fish species. We posit that performance is limited because reserves protect unique spatial features, or conserve narrow estuaries with weak connections to mangrove habitats and the open sea. Consequently, reserves as currently positioned protect only a subset of potential environmental conditions present for fish within the region, and potentially support residual estuarine habitats (i.e. expansive intertidal flats or shallow creeks) which are not particularly significant to either fish or fishers.

This species was not recorded inside the Lough until 1980, but by 2001 was the dominant intertidal barnacle within the reserve. It has been suggested that increases in the abundance of this species at other locations in Europe may be linked to increasing sea surface temperatures, and that A. modestus is an ecological sleeper. Despite an overall trend for increasing sea surface temperatures, this long term warming is punctuated by extreme events such as severely cold winters. A. modestus is warm water adapted, and has been recorded to decrease in abundance following cold winters. The winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 were amongst the coldest recorded in Ireland in past decades. In the present study, higher levels of mortality were recorded for A. modestus than native barnacle species in Lough Hyne following these cold winters. Additionally, this species was recorded at lower abundances at the majority of sites surveyed in Lough Hyne in 2011 compared with 2009. Despite this, A. modestus remains the dominant barnacle species in the Lough and monitoring the recruitment of intertidal barnacles within Lough Hyne during 2014-2015 revealed that A. modestus was the most abundant recruit at study sites, both in removal plots and in the pre-existing community. The year-round breeding of A. modestus in addition to the closed nature of the Lough promotes A. modestus within the reserve. Despite this, native barnacle species continue to persist in Lough Hyne, though generally at low abundances, with the exception of exposed locations such as the Rapids and Bullock Island where natives outnumber A. modestus. The future intertidal barnacle community within the Lough is likely to be dominated by A. modestus with Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus being abundant at sites which are not suitable for A. modestus. While the consequences of this are unknown, it is possible that the presence of A. modestus may alter trophic interactions and energy flow within the reserve. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the growing number of conservation measures, long-term studies on the recovery of deep-water coral communities from fisheries impacts remain scarce. In the Gulf of Maine, the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area (NECCCA)' was established in 2002 to protect dense aggregations of the two numerically dominant octocoral species in the region, Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea. To evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation measures, we monitored shifts in abundance and size of these two coral species in the shallow section (400-700 m) of the NECCCA for 12 years after the fisheries closure. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the location of the deep boundaries of the NECCCA that were placed based on a precautionary approach with limited information on coral distribution at depths > 500 m. Video transects were conducted with ROV ROPOS in 2001, 2006,2010 and 2014. We found potential signs of recovery from fisheries impact at some of the shallow locations in 2014: higher coral abundance and the presence of some very large colonies as well as recruits compared to 2001 and 2006. However, spatial heterogeneity was pronounced and small colonies ( <20 cm) indicative of successful recruitment were not found at all sites, underscoring the need for long-term protection measures to allow full recovery of impacted coral communities. At 700-1500 m different coral taxa were dominant than at the shallow locations and coral abundance peaked between 700 and1200.m. High abundance and diversity of corals at this depth range, 8-10 km southwest of the NECCCA, suggest that an extension of the southwest boundary should be considered. Comparably low coral abundance was found at depths of 1200-1500 m inside the NECCCA indicating an appropriate initial placement of the southeast boundary.

Pacific cod from 1.3 to 2.8yr old were concentrated in the area off Fukushima Prefecture. These results suggest that Pacific cod increased post-2011 not because of the occurrence of strong year classes followed by good recruitments but because of the lower mortality after recruitment owing to reduced fishing mortality.

We estimated the abundance of Japanese flounder using catch per unit effort from coastal gill net and offshore bottom trawl fishing from January 2000 to February 2011 and predicted the abundance under two different fishing effort scenarios (the same effort level as 2010 or decreased effort after the FNPP accident). Estimated abundance reflected the seasonal coastal-offshore migrations well, and it was estimated that abundance increased during and after 2007 because of high recruitments. In contrast, it was concluded that the predicted abundance on and after 2012 increased owing to the decreased fishing effort because the same estimated recruits were used in both scenarios. This indicates that the waters off Fukushima have effectively been serving as a marine protected area for Japanese flounder since the FNPP accident.

Generally, well-managed and enforced MPAs can increase or maintain the diversity and function of the enclosed coral reef, with some of the benefits extending to adjacent nonprotected reefs. A fundamental question in coral reef conservation is whether these benefits arise within small MPAs (< 1 km(2)), because larval input of reef organisms is largely decoupled from local adult reproduction. We examined the structure of fish assemblages, composition of fish feeding groups, benthic cover, and key ecosystem processes (grazing, macroalgal browsing, and coral replenishment) in three small (0.5-0.8 km(2)) no-take MPAs and adjacent areas where fisheries are allowed (non-MPAs) on coral reefs in Fiji. The MPAs exhibited greater species richness, density, and biomass of fishes than non-MPAs. Furthermore, MPAs contained a greater abundance and biomass of grazing herbivores and piscivores as well as a greater abundance of cleaners than fished areas. We also found differences in fish associations when foraging, with feeding groups being generally more diverse and having greater biomass within MPAs than adjacent non-MPAs. Grazing by parrotfishes was 3-6 times greater, and macroalgal browsing was 3-5 times greater in MPAs than in non-MPAs. On average, MPAs had 260-280% as much coral cover and only 5-25% as much macroalgal cover as their paired non-MPA sites. Finally, two of the three MPAs had three-fold more coral recruits than adjacent non-MPAs. The results of this study indicate that small MPAs benefit not only populations of reef fishes, but also enhance ecosystem processes that are critical to reef resilience within the MPAs.",37,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0170638,WOS:000396167300033,field?,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,too indirect measures of connectivity

Here, we offer a pathway that can unite fishers, scientists, resource managers and conservationists towards a single vision for some areas of the ocean where small investments in management can offer disproportionately large benefits to fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Specifically, we provide a series of evidenced-based arguments that support an urgent need to recognize fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) as a focal point for fisheries management and conservation on a global scale, with a particular emphasis placed on the protection of multispecies FSA sites. We illustrate that these sites serve as productivity hotspots - small areas of the ocean that are dictated by the interactions between physical forces and geomorphology, attract multiple species to reproduce in large numbers and support food web dynamics, ecosystem health and robust fisheries. FSAs are comparable in vulnerability, importance and magnificence to breeding aggregations of seabirds, sea turtles and whales yet they receive insufficient attention and are declining worldwide. Numerous case-studies confirm that protected aggregations do recover to benefit fisheries through increases in fish biomass, catch rates and larval recruitment at fished sites. The small size and spatio-temporal predictability of FSAs allow monitoring, assessment and enforcement to be scaled down while benefits of protection scale up to entire populations. Fishers intuitively understand the linkages between protecting FSAs and healthy fisheries and thus tend to support their protection.",79,2017,10.1111/faf.12132,WOS:000396407200009,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

Potting surveys conducted over 4 years revealed significantly higher catch per unit effort (cpue 109% greater), weight per unit effort (wpue 189% greater), and carapace length (10-15mm greater) in lobsters within the reserve compared with control sites. However, likely due to low levels of recruitment and increased fishing effort outside the reserve, lobster catches decreased in all areas during the final 2 years. Nevertheless, catch rates remained higher within the reserve across all years, suggesting the reserve buffered these wider declines. Additionally, lobster cpue and wpue declined with increasing distance from the boundaries of the marine reserve, a trend which tag-recapture data suggested were due to spillover. Catches of berried lobster were also twice as high within the reserve than outside, and the mean potential reproductive output per female was 22.1% greater. It was originally thought that higher densities of lobster within the reserve might lead to greater levels of aggression and physical damage. However, damage levels were solely related to body size, as large lobsters >110mm had sustained over 218% more damage than smaller individuals. Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others.",7,2017,10.1093/icesjms/fsw166,WOS:000397136400025,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

D.",Patterns of larval-stage connectivity of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within the Gulf of Maine in relation to current structure and a proposed fisheries closure,.,.,"The decline of the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, stock in the Gulf of Maine to a historically low biomass has been coupled with a severe contraction in spatial range. The stock is now largely concentrated in the western Gulf of Maine. This erosion of spatial stock structure may be a factor-inhibiting recovery of Gulf of Maine cod. However, recent efforts to rebuild anadromous forage fish in the coastal Maine region coupled with the proposed creation of a new Eastern Maine Closed Area (EMCA), sited where localized depletion of the cod stock has been especially severe, might enable reestablishment of lost spatial structure of Gulf of Maine cod. We carried out larval transport modeling to examine the potential benefit of recovered cod spawning in the EMCA through supplying larvae to suitable juvenile settlement areas in the Gulf of Maine coastal zone and in the Cashes Ledge Closed Area (CLCA) in the central Gulf of Maine. The results indicate that an appreciable fraction of the larvae spawned in the EMCA are retained, to an age of settlement capability, in the coastal Maine region. Spawning in the EMCA may thus be a contributor of juveniles to a local, eastern Gulf of Maine, cod sub-stock. The results further indicate that spawning in the EMCA may supply a substantial subsidy of larvae to suitable juvenile habitat in the western Gulf of Maine and the CLCA. Protection of spawning stock in the EMCA may thus provide demographic benefits for the wider Gulf of Maine cod stock. Patterns of larval-stage connectivity between various potential spawning regions (including the EMCA) and areas of suitable juvenile habitat exhibit considerable interannual variability, which is predominantly linked to variability in the large-scale Gulf of Maine circulation. This result underscores the value of spatially explicit management as a means of fostering the recovery of the Gulf of Maine cod stock.",1,2017,10.1093/icesjms/fsw139,WOS:000397136400003,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,assesses connectivity in the region through larval connectivity model in order to estimate the relevance of a proposed MPA

To counter this problem, about 200 governments worldwide have committed to protecting 10%-20% of national coastal marine areas. However, associated impacts on fisheries productivity are unclear and could weaken the food security of hundreds of millions of people who depend on diverse and largely unregulated fishing activities. Here, we present a systematic theoretic analysis of the ability of reserves to rebuild fisheries under such complex conditions, and we identify maximum reserve coverages for biodiversity conservation that do not impair long-term fisheries productivity. Our analysis assumes that fishers have no viable alternative to fishing, such that total fishing effort remains constant (at best). We find that realistic reserve networks, which protect 10%-30% of fished habitats in 1-20 km wide reserves, should benefit the long-term productivity of almost any complex fishery. We discover a rule of thumb to safeguard against the long-term catch depletion of particular species: individual reserves should export 30% or more of locally produced larvae to adjacent fishing grounds. Specifically on coral reefs, where fishers tend to overexploit species whose dispersal distances as larvae exceed the home ranges of adults, decisions on the size of reserves needed to meet the 30% larval export rule are unlikely to compromise the protection of resident adults. Even achieving the modest Aichi Target 11 of 10% effective protection can then help rebuild depleted catch. However, strictly protecting 20%-30% of fished habitats is unlikely to diminish catch even if overfishing is not yet a problem while providing greater potential for biodiversity conservation and fishery rebuilding if overfishing is substantial. These findings are important because they suggest that doubling or tripling the only globally enforced marine reserve target will benefit biodiversity conservation and higher fisheries productivity where both are most urgently needed.",27,2017,10.1371/journal.pbio.2000537,WOS:000393787500006,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about MPA design

Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish boxes (buffer zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls. (3) They maintain the natural size and age structure of the populations, hence maximizing potential fecundity, allowing biomass export to occur from core to regulated areas, dampening the fluctuations derived from deviations from the theoretical optimal effort in the fishing zone.",11,2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.0245,WOS:000457690600243,review,NA,2016,MPA,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,,NA,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,.,.,.,connectivity,.,reproductive potential,spawning stock biomass,p3,positive,no,NA,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,OutMA because not quantitative

The benefits of spillover, however, may not be realized if the populations or habitats outside of reserves are too degraded. We quantified oyster population density and demographics such as recruitment, growth, mortality, and potential larval output as a function of two types of oyster management strategies in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA: (1) natural reefs + harvested and (2) restored reefs + harvested. We compared these data to demographic data collected as a function of a third type of management strategy, (3) restored reefs + protected from harvest. Mean oyster recruitment was similar to 12 times higher in restored + harvested reefs than in natural + harvested reefs. Mean total oyster density was similar to 8- to 72-times higher in restored + protected reefs than in restored + harvested or natural + harvested reefs, respectively. Moreover, harvested reefs exhibited truncated size structure, and few or no individuals greater than legal size (75 mm), whereas protected reefs typically had a polymodal size structure, including many large individuals. We estimate that restored + protected reefs have similar to 4 to 700 times greater potential larval output m(-2) than restored + harvested or natural + harvested reefs, respectively. After accounting for total sound-wide areal coverage of each reef type, total potential larval output from restored + protected reefs was similar to 6 times greater than that from natural + harvested and restored + harvested reefs. Marine reserves can potentially subsidize harvested populations via larval spillover, however, in the case of oyster reefs in Pamlico Sound, the relatively degraded conditions of natural reefs (e.g., low vertical relief, low shell volume per square meter) may not provide much in the way of suitable settlement substrate to realize the benefits of larval spillover from reserves. Restoration of oyster reefs, even with a thin veneer of substrate, may improve settlement substrate to increase the benefits of larval spillover from reserves.",15,2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.00326,WOS:000457690600324,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,"study of 3 different management systems such as restored-harvested, natural-harvested, restored-protected"

Connectivity is also essential for maintaining and restoring natural ecological processes with genetic diversity contributing to the adaptation and persistence of any species in the face of global disturbances. Estimates of connectivity are crucial to inform the design of both marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks. Among several approaches, genetic structure is frequently used as a proxy for patterns of connectivity. Using 8 microsatellite loci, we investigated genetic structure of the two-banded sea bream Diplodus vulgaris, a coastal fish that is both commercially and ecologically important. Adults were sampled in 7 locations (stretches of coastline approximately 8 km long) and juveniles in 14 sites (similar to 100 to 200 m of coastline) along 200 km of the Apulian Adriatic coast (SW Adriatic Sea), within and outside an MPA (Torre Guaceto MPA, Italy). Our study found similar genetic diversity indices for both the MPA and the surrounding fished areas. An overall lack of genetic structure among samples suggests high gene flow (i.e. connectivity) across a scale of at least 200 km. However, some local genetic divergences found in two locations demonstrate some heterogeneity in processes renewing the population along the Apulian Adriatic coast. Furthermore, two sites appeared genetically divergent, reinforcing our observations within the genetic makeup of adults and confirming heterogeneity in early stage genetics that can come from either different supply populations or from chaotic genetic patchiness occurring under temporal variation in recruitment and in the reproductive success.

Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60-220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6% and 9% of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short-distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long-distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to similar to 250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best-fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of similar to 110 km for P. maculatus and similar to 190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

The negative impact of Pyura gathering on mid-intertidal abundances of this species has recently been reported at the south-eastern end of this bay. In the present study we have increased sampling sites to cover the entire bay toward the north-western end and the northern section, where a coastal marine reserve for the scallop fishery partially restricts shellfish gathering. Therefore, the sampling sites were chosen to represent different levels of shellfish gathering access along the northern shore of the bay. Long-term monitoring (1999-2014) of changes in tunicate cover and the abundances of larvae and recruits at seven sites are reported. The opening of a remodelled artificial and recreational beach in 2012, on the central-eastern shore of the bay, has increased accessibility to rocky intertidal platforms that started to be massively visited by Pyura gatherers from the summer of 2013. This allowed for the implementation of an intensive short-term monitoring program of changes in tunicate cover and the abundances of their larvae and recruits. When gathering access was present the reduction in intertidal cover was generalized to the entire bay and followed by reductions in larvae and recruits. However, these reductions were not found in sites with more restricted gathering access. We conclude that continuous extraction by Pyura gatherers followed by reductions of conspecific larvae and recruits are the main drivers behind the reduced abundance of P. praeputialis in the entire bay of Antofagasta. Thus, if gathering is not stopped important ecosystem services provided by this tunicate in the bay may be threatened.

Epinephelus marginatus is a long-lived, sedentary, reef-associated protogynous hermaphrodite with high commercial and recreational value that is at risk of extinction throughout its global distribution. Based on global trends, population substructuring and gaps in local knowledge this has led to an increased interest in evaluation of local stock. Assessment of Maltese demography was based on historical and contemporary catch landings data whilst genetic population structure and regional connectivity patterns were evaluated by examining 175 individuals collected within the central Mediterranean region between 2002 and 2009 using 14 nuclear microsatellite loci. Demographic stock assessment of Maltese E. marginatus' revealed a 99% decline in catch landings between 1947 and 2009 within the Fisheries Management Zone. A contemporary modest mean size was observed, 3 +/- 3 kg, where approximately 17% of the population was juvenile, 68% female/sex-changing and 15% were male with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1:5. Genetic analysis describes the overall population of E. marginatus' within the Fisheries Management Zone as decreasing in size (theta(H) = 2.2), which has gone through a significant size reduction in the past (M = 0.41) and consequently shows signs of moderate inbreeding (F-IS = 0.10, p < 0.001) with an estimated effective population size of 130 individuals.

Reserve design depends on estimates of connectivity and scales of dispersal for the taxa of interest. Deep-sea taxa are hypothesized to disperse greater distances than shallow-water taxa, which implies that reserves would need to be larger in size and networks could be more widely spaced; however, this paradigm has not been tested. We compiled population genetic studies of deep-sea fauna and estimated dispersal distances for 51 studies using a method based on isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates of dispersal distance ranged from 0.24 km to 2028 km with a geometric mean of 33.2 km and differed in relation to taxonomic and life-history factors as well as several study parameters. Dispersal distances were generally greater for fishes than invertebrates with the Mollusca being the least dispersive sampled phylum. Species that are pelagic as adults were more dispersive than those with sessile or sedentary lifestyles. Benthic species from soft-substrate habitats were generally less dispersive than species from hard substrate, demersal or pelagic habitats. As expected, species with pelagic and/or feeding (planktotrophic) larvae were more dispersive than other larval types. Many of these comparisons were confounded by taxonomic or other life-history differences (e.g. fishes being more dispersive than invertebrates) making any simple interpretation difficult. Our results provide the first rough estimate of the range of dispersal distances in the deep sea and allow comparisons to shallow-water assemblages. Overall, dispersal distances were greater for deeper taxa, although the differences were not large (0.3-0.6 orders of magnitude between means), and imbalanced sampling of shallow and deep taxa complicates any simple interpretation. Our analyses suggest the scales of dispersal and connectivity for reserve design in the deep sea might be comparable to or slightly larger than those in shallow water. Deep-sea reserve design will need to consider the enormous variety of taxa, life histories, hydrodynamics, spatial configuration of habitats and patterns of species distributions. The many caveats of our analyses provide a strong impetus for substantial future efforts to assess connectivity of deep-sea species from a variety of habitats, taxonomic groups and depth zones.",51,2016,10.1111/mec.13689,WOS:000379614400004,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no MPA

However, although plenty of studies have provided evidence of the benefits produced within MPA boundaries, overall benefits to local fisheries, especially via spillover, seem to be still unclear. Because of the lost fishing grounds following an MPA establishment, local fishermen usually oppose MPAs. There is, therefore, the urgent need for a better understanding of the mechanism(s) through which MPAs can export fishable fish biomass towards adjacent fished areas, a process that could counterbalance the loss of fishing grounds. Here we review the literature on spillover for refining the terminology, detailing the underlying mechanisms and identifying both the existing and needed methodological approaches to measure spillover. Operationally, two types of spillover should be considered: ecological spillover (i.e. the net export of juvenile, subadult and adult biomass from MPAs outwards driven by density-dependent processes) and the fishery spillover (i.e. the proportion of this biomass that can be fished, taking into account regulations and accessibility). Underwater visual census and tagging/tracking may allow getting evidence of ecological spillover, while experimental catch data are essential to assess and monitor fishery spillover, which is the main component of MPAs that can provide direct benefit to local fisheries.

For fishery species, reserves are often implemented alongside more conventional harvest strategies, including catch and size limits [2, 5]. However, catch and fish abundances observed post-intervention are often attributed to reserves, without explicitly estimating the potential contribution of concurrent management interventions [2, 3, 6-9]. Here we test a metapopulation model against observed fishery [10] and population [11] data for an important coral reef fishery (coral trout; Plectropomus spp.) in Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) to evaluate how the combined increase in reserve area [12] and reduction in fishing effort [13, 14] in 2004 influenced changes in fish stocks and the commercial fishery. We found that declines in catch, increases in catch rates, and increases in biomass since 2004 were substantially attributable to the integration of direct effort controls with the rezoning, rather than the rezoning alone. The combined management approach was estimated to have been more productive for fish and fisheries than if the rezoning had occurred alone and comparable to what would have been obtained with effort controls alone. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the direct effort controls prevented initial decreases in catch per unit effort that would have otherwise occurred with the rezoning. Our findings demonstrate that by concurrently restructuring the fishery, the conservation benefits of reserves were enhanced and the fishery cost of rezoning the reserve network was socialized, mitigating negative impacts on individual fishers.",16,2016,10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.022,WOS:000378661800017,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Effective application of these concepts to marine reserves is limited by data on demographic rates within reserves and larval connectivity among reserves. Using a network of reserves established to restore eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA as our model system, we integrated empirically based demographic rates and regional hydrodynamic-based connectivity estimates within a metapopulation model to (1) evaluate the potential for the reserve network to function as a self-persistent oyster metapopulation, (2) determine the relative importance of demographics vs. connectivity on reserve source-sink dynamics, (3) assess the efficacy of stock enhancement in promoting metapopulation persistence, and (4) evaluate whether application of a Few Large or Several Small reserves-a modification of the Single Large or Several Small concept-promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae within the reserve network (i.e., local larval retention within reserves + larval connectivity among reserves). The reserve network failed to function as a self-persistent metapopulation, despite exceptional demographic rates within reserves. When considering only larval supply from reserves, local retention and connectivity were insufficient to provide annual replacement (>=similar to 0.25 recruits per adult). Accordingly, reserves contributed to the metapopulation primarily via production, not dispersal, of larvae and reserve source-sink dynamics were influenced more by demographics within reserves, particularly adult growth and survival, than larval connectivity among reserves. Addressing recruitment limitation via stock enhancement was not effective at augmenting projected metapopulation declines. Several small reserves initially promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae than a few large reserves, however, as the number or area of reserves increased, metapopulation retention was equivalent among designs, suggesting that Few Large and Several Small reserves may be the best network design. Marine reserves can be an effective restoration tool for improving demographic rates within reserve boundaries, but designation of multiple reserves does not guarantee a functional reserve network metapopulation.

Although the knowledge about population connectivity is considered fundamental for the optimal design of MPAs and networks, the amount of information available for the Mediterranean Sea is currently scarce. We investigated the genetic structure of the saddled sea bream (Oblada melanura) and the level of genetic connectivity between protected and unprotected locations, using a set of 11 microsatellite loci. Spatial patterns of population differentiation were assessed locally (50-100 km) and regionally (500-1000 km), considering three MPAs of the Western Mediterranean Sea. All values of genetic differentiation between locations (Fst and Jost's D) were non-significant after Bon-ferroni correction, indicating that, at a relatively small spatial scale, protected locations were in general well connected with non-protected ones. On the other hand, at the regional scale, discriminant analysis of principal components revealed the presence of a subtle pattern of genetic heterogeneity that reflects the geography and the main oceanographic features (currents and barriers) of the study area. This genetic pattern could be a consequence of different processes acting at different spatial and temporal scales among which the presence of admixed populations, large population sizes and species dispersal capacity, could play a major role. These outcomes can have important implications for the conservation biology and fishery management of the saddled sea bream and provide useful information for genetic population studies of other coastal fishes in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

We examined the transient consequences of reserve establishment for fished metapopulations, considering both a well-mixed larval pool and a spatially explicit model based on a coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation. When fishing pressure was reallocated relative to the area protected, yields decreased initially, then recovered, and ultimately exceeded pre-reserve levels. However, recovery time was on the order of several years to decades. If fishing pressure intensified to maintain pre-reserve yields, reserves were sometimes unable to support the increased mortality and the metapopulation collapsed.

Ensuring stock sustainability requires the provision of crucial information, such as species spatial distribution or unbiased abundance and precision estimates, so that management strategies can be defined (e.g. fishing quotas, temporal closure areas or marine protected areas MPA). Furthermore, the estimation of the precision of global abundance at different sampling intensities can be used for survey design optimisation. Geostatistics provide a priori unbiased estimations of the spatial structure, global abundance and precision for autocorrelated data. However, their application to non-Gaussian data introduces difficulties in the analysis in conjunction with low robustness or unbiasedness. The present study applied intrinsic geostatistics in two dimensions in order to (i) analyse the spatial distribution of anchovy in Spanish Western Mediterranean waters during the species recruitment season, (ii) produce distribution maps, (iii) estimate global abundance and its precision, (iv) analyse the effect of changing the sampling intensity on the precision of global abundance estimates and, (v) evaluate the effects of several methodological options on the robustness of all the analysed parameters.

The movements of P. novaezealandiae were examined within adult scallop habitat in a customary fisheries reserve, Te Whaka Te Wera (Paterson Inlet) Mataitai, Raldura (Stewart Island), New Zealand, by tracking the dispersal of tagged scallops from a central release point over two months. The average distance moved, calculated from recovered scallops, was 1.82 m per month, and these movement rates did not differ between the five sites or the two size classes examined. No significant directional movement was observed. The distribution of adult scallops is unlikely to be significantly affected by the scale of random movement observed. Once P. novaezealandiae are settled in appropriate habitat they are likely to only move in response to potential predators. Any spatial refuge created through management intervention, is likely to have positive effects through enhanced larval recruitment due to protection of breeding aggregations, not through movement of adults.

Further, the establishment of an MPA generates a higher relative population source within the MPA for species with low dispersal abilities than for species with high dispersal abilities.

D.",Effects of marine reserves on the reproductive biology and recruitment rates of commonly and rarely exploited limpets,.,.,"We tested the effects of marine reserve status on the reproductive biology and recruitment rates of two commonly exploited (Helcion concolor, Scutellastra longicosta) and two rarely exploited (Cellana capensis, Scutellastra granularis) limpet species using two reserve and two non-reserve sites on the south coast of South Africa. Because densities of commonly exploited species are lower outside reserves, we hypothesised that limpets outside reserves will: (i) mature earlier; and (ii) show higher individual reproductive output. Rarely exploited species should show no such effects. For recruitment, we hypothesised that if recruits are attracted to adults or survive better where there are more adults, then commonly exploited (but not rarely exploited) species should show higher recruitment inside reserves. Analyses of gonadosomatic indices produced significant Month x Reserve interactions for all species (ANCOVA, p < 0.05), indicating inconsistent reserve effects even for exploited species, although months with significant differences occurred more often in the commonly exploited species, giving weak support to the hypothesis regarding reproductive output. Reserve status had no significant effect on sex ratios or size at sexual maturity for either sex of any species. Accordingly, reserves had only a minor influence on reproduction in these species, which might reflect an indirect effect of poor policing. The timing of major recruitment events differed among species, with two broad patterns: recruitment was sporadic for C. capensis and S. longicosta and protracted for H. concolor and S. granularis. Recruit densities showed strong site effects. Highest recruitment occurred at the exploited site, Xhora, with no reserve effects, except in a single month for C. capensis, indicating that recruitment is independent of whether the site is protected or not. Therefore, reserves do not enhance recruitment directly, but because these populations appear to be open on scales of tens of kilometres, generally higher densities of limpets within reserves could enhance overall recruitment, because of greater gamete output by the population. Accordingly, reserves might have an indirect 'spillover' effect on recruitment, if not a direct one.",0,2016,10.2989/1814232X.2016.1255255,WOS:000391853200009,field,CI,2002-2004,MPA,Dwesa-Cwebe,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,South Africa,temperate,Africa,Indian Ocean,NA,invertebrate,mix,mix,no,.,.,.,connectivity,.,recruitment,recruitment,figure 5,neutral,yes,number of individuals per m^2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,VARIANCE NOT PROVIDED

A.",Reef shark movements relative to a coastal marine protected area,.,.,"Marine protected areas (MPA) are one management tool that can potentially reduce declining shark populations. Protected-area design should be based on detailed movements of target animals; however, such data are lacking for most species. To address this, 25 sharks from three species were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored with a network of 103 receivers to determine the use of a protected area at Mangrove Bay, Western Australia. Movements of a subset of 12 individuals (Carcharhinus melanopterus [n = 7]), C. amblyrhynchos [n = 2], and Negaprion acutidens [n = 3]) were analysed over two years. Residency for all species ranged between 12 and 96%. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos had <1% of position estimates within the MPA, compared to C. melanopterus adults that ranged between 0 and 99%. Juvenile sharks had high percentages of position estimates in the MPA (84-99%). Kernel density activity centres for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos were largely outside the MPA and mean activity space estimates for adults were 12.8 km(2) (+/- 3.12 SE) and 19.6 km(2) (+/- 2.26), respectively. Juveniles had smaller activity spaces: C. melanopterus, 7.2 +/- 1.33 km(2); N. acutidens, 0.6 km(2) (+/- 0.04). Both C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos had peaks in detections during daylight hours (1200 and 0900 h, respectively), whereas N. acutidens had a peak in detections at 0200 h. Long-distance movements were observed for adult C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos, the longest being approximately 275 km. These migrations of C. melanopterus might be related to reproductive behaviours, because they were all observed in adult females during the summer months and provide links between known in-shore aggregation and possible nursery areas. The MPA at Mangrove Bay provided some protection for juvenile and adult reef sharks, although protection is likely greater for juveniles due to their more restricted movements.

From 2012 to 2015, we performed a census and an ecological study for this gastropod mollusc in the Zembra Archipelago National Park in Tunisia, where a large population still remains. In 1986, a total of 20,000 individuals were estimated, with 0.7 ind/m(2), 4.4 cm adult mean size and low recruitment rate. In 2009, the estimated population reached 38,559 individuals with 2.65 ind/m(2), 5.42 cm adult mean size and high recruitment rate. During the present work, 43,790 individuals were estimated in 2012, 27,359 in 2013, 33,170 in 2014 and 40,404 in 2015, with an average density ranging from 0.1 to 8.5 individuals per square metre, but reaching as many as 25 ind/m(2) on some shores. This makes the archipelago one of the most important Mediterranean 'hot spots' for P. ferruginea, as it has a large and well-conserved population of this species. Variability of the population size is influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors, but is principally impacted by poaching of the species. The poachers target individuals larger than 6 cm in length, and the sex ratio study has shown that over 70% of individuals become females at that size. In addition, high recruitment rates were recorded in 2012 and 2013, but these decreased in 2014 and 2015, although population numbers show the opposite pattern. Moreover, growth rate is low and P. ferruginea may need many years to reach a large adult size. The loss of reproductive potential due to poaching inevitably causes a significant imbalance in the limpet population.

Despite major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable yield (MSY) under conventional quota management if reserves provide protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net fishery benefit of MRs is lost when gains in fecundity of old, large individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic overfishing.",18,2015,10.1098/rstb.2014.0276,WOS:000362720200008,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Here, we derived a size-based, spatially explicit, stochastic demographic model to explore how different spatial configurations of MR networks can affect abundance and commercial yield of the green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), taking as a reference case the abalone fishery of Isla Natividad in Baja California Sur (Mexico). Our analysis suggests that a network of MRs can have a positive effect on abalone population abundance and a slightly negative effect on fishery output with respect to traditional maximum sustainable yield (MSY; i.e., with no reserves). Simulations show that maximum catches achievable with MRs are, under the best configuration, similar to 2%-14% lower than traditional MSY depending on the total fraction of the fishing grounds protected. In the case of overexploitation, long-term yields can increase following the implementation of MRs. In addition, in the presence of MRs, abundances and yields are much less sensitive to systematic errors in the enforcement of the optimal harvesting rate compared with situations in which MRs are not present. Given the limited dispersal ability of the species, the best outcomes in terms of fishery output would be achieved with very small reserves-around 100 m wide-so to maximize larval export in the fishable areas. Our results indicate appropriately designed MR networks are an effective strategy for meeting both conservation and economic goals under uncertainty. While the size of the existing reserves in Isla Natividad seems adequate to protect the abalone stock, smaller reserves could maximize fishery benefits, although this poses challenges for enforcement.",17,2015,10.1139/cjfas-2013-0623,WOS:000361828400007,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

More interesting, biomass of targeted fish species also increased outside MPAs, although only 27% as rapidly as in the protected areas, indicating that redistribution of fishing effort has not severely affected unprotected populations. Whether the increase outside of MPAs is due to changes in fishing pressure, fisheries management actions, adult spillover, favorable environmental conditions, or a combination of all four remains unknown.

Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-naive individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish naivete or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (Serranus scriba), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (Chromis chromis). While all of the individuals of S. scriba observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-naive and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (Coris julis and Diplodus annularis) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced naivete effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the effective contribution may be smaller than predicted for certain highly catchable species such as S. scriba.",20,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0135348,WOS:000359493600061,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Given that trophic interactions underpin community responses following protection and that complex ecological interactions make responses difficult to identify, quantifying changes in species traits may provide detail missed by traditional diversity measures, including information relevant to ecosystem functioning. We determine whether this is the case by comparing community metrics based on functional traits to taxonomic diversity measures associated with no take' marine reserves and partially protected, fished areas along eight degrees of latitude.LocationEighteen no take' marine reserves and 14 partially protected, fished areas along the east coast of Australia.MethodWe use two independent datasets from shallow and deep coastal rocky reefs to analyse trait-based metrics and taxonomic diversity from sites inside reserves to sites in partially protected, fished areas.ResultsTaxonomic diversity (species diversity and richness) and trait-based multimetrics (functional richness and dispersion) showed no difference with level of protection. Total fish abundance responded positively to protection, but only on shallow reefs. Comparing values of individual functional traits implied a return of larger bodied species of fish in protected areas and an increase in trophic level. The latter was significant on deeper reefs and was strongly correlated with age of protected area. Thus, recovery responses were largely associated with community mean functional trait values, highlighting the value of trait-based approaches for detecting change, when no differences in traditional taxonomic diversity measures were apparent.Main conclusionsWe empirically demonstrate that functional traits can elucidate early conservation outcomes, when traditional multimetric diversity indices do not distinguish protected and fished communities.

Advice to the Australian and Queensland governments that supported this initiative predicted these additional closures would generate minimal (10%) initial reductions in both catch and landed value within the GBR area, with recovery of catches becoming apparent after three years. To test these predictions, commercial fisheries data from the GBR area and from the two adjacent (non-GBR) areas of Queensland were compared for the periods immediately before and after the closures were implemented. The observed means for total annual catch and value within the GBR declined from pre-closure (2000-2003) levels of 12780 Mg and Australian $160 million, to initial post-closure (2005-2008) levels of 8143 Mg and $102 million; decreases of 35% and 36% respectively. Because the reference areas in the non-GBR had minimal changes in catch and value, the beyond-BACI (before, after, control, impact) analyses estimated initial net reductions within the GBR of 35% for both total catch and value. There was no evidence of recovery in total catch levels or any comparative improvement in catch rates within the GBR nine years after implementation. These results are not consistent with the advice to governments that the closures would have minimal initial impacts and rapidly generate benefits to fisheries in the GBR through increased juvenile recruitment and adult spillovers. Instead, the absence of evidence of recovery in catches to date currently supports an alternative hypothesis that where there is already effective fisheries management, the closing of areas to all fishing will generate reductions in overall catches similar to the percentage of the fished area that is closed.",23,2015,10.1890/14-1427.1,WOS:000356898400003,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about recovery of fish catch in fisheries after closures

Over the past 15 yr, studies of larval dispersal in coral reef fishes have generated accumulating evidence of consistently high levels of self-recruitment and local retention at various spatial scales. These findings have, to a certain degree, created a paradigm shift toward the perception that large fractions of locally produced recruitment may be the rule rather than the exception. Here we examined the degree of localized settlement in an anemonefish, Amphiprion bicinctus, at a solitary coral reef in the central Red Sea by integrating estimates of self-recruitment obtained from genetic parentage analysis with predictions of local retention derived from a biophysical dispersal model parameterized with real-time physical forcing. Self-recruitment at the reef scale (c. 0.7 km(2)) was virtually absent during two consecutive January spawning events (1.4 % in 2012 and 0 % in 2013). Predicted levels of local retention at the reef scale varied temporally, but were comparatively low for both simulations (7 % in 2012 and 0 % in 2013). At the same time, the spatial scale of simulated dispersal was restricted to approximately 20 km from the source.

The effectiveness of MPAs depends on population connectivity patterns between protected and non-protected areas. Remote islands are endemism hotspots for coral reef fishes and provide rare examples of coral reefs with limited fishing pressure. This study explored population genetic connectivity across a network of protected and non-protected areas for the endemic wrasse, Coris bulbifrons, which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to its small, decreasing geographic range and declining abundance. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite DNA (msatDNA) markers were used to estimate historic and contemporary gene flow to determine the level of population self-replenishment and to measure genetic and genotypic diversity among all four locations in the species range (south-west Pacific Ocean)-Middleton Reef (MR), Elizabeth Reef (ER), Lord Howe Island (LHI) and Norfolk Island (NI). MPAs exist at MR and LHI and are limited or non-existent at ER and NI, respectively. There was no obvious differentiation in mtDNA among locations, however, msatDNA revealed differentiation between the most peripheral (NI) and all remaining locations (MR, ER and LHI). Despite high mtDNA connectivity (M = 259-1,144), msatDNA connectivity was limited (M = 3-9) with high self-replenishment (68-93 %) at all locations. NI is the least connected and heavily reliant on self-replenishment, and the absence of MPAs at NI needs to be rectified to ensure the persistence of endemic species at this location. Other endemic fishes exhibit similar patterns of high self-replenishment across the four locations, indicating that a single spatial management approach consisting of a MPA network protecting part of each location could provide reasonable protection for these species. Thus, the existing network of MPAs at this endemic hotspot appears adequate at some locations, but not at all.",6,2015,10.1007/s00338-014-1242-2,WOS:000354189600003,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,assesses genetic structuring between sites

Three fishing gear types are used by fishermen to catch groupers, with speargun fisheries being the most effective. In 2011, the speargun effort was decreased, based on self-regulation by fishermen; this resulted in a change in the groupers' target size and impacted recruitment success, with an increase in the stock size and biomass of groupers in 2012. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the establishment of marine protected areas alone, as exemplified by the establishment of three core zones in Karimunjawa National Park, is not sufficient on its own to protect natural populations of groupers, and that fishing-gear regulation and community support are also required.",4,2015,10.1007/s12562-015-0863-x,WOS:000354194100002,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not about effect of MPA on connectivity but on abundance and biomass

Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Spillover can contribute to poverty alleviation, although its effect is modulated by the number of fishermen and fishing intensity. In this study, we quantify the effects of a community-managed marine reserve in a high poverty area of Northern Mozambique. For this purpose, underwater visual censuses of reef fish were undertaken at three different times: 3 years before (2003), at the time of establishment (2006) and 6 years after the marine reserve establishment (2012). The survey locations were chosen inside, outside and on the border of the marine reserve. Benthic cover composition was quantified at the same sites in 2006 and 2012. After the reserve establishment, fish sizes were also estimated. Regression tree models show that the distance from the border and the time after reserve establishment were the variables with the strongest effect on fish abundance. The extent and direction of the spillover depends on trophic group and fish size. Poisson Generalized Linear Models show that, prior to the reserve establishment, the survey sites did not differ but, after 6 years, the abundance of all fish inside the reserve has increased and caused spillover of herbivorous fish. Spillover was detected 1 km beyond the limit of the reserve for small herbivorous fishes.

To test estuarine connectivity potential, we translocated 5 species of juvenile predatory fishes between 2 discrete estuaries approximately 10 km apart, and using passive acoustic telemetry, measured their ability to home back to their estuary of capture. Individuals from all species except Paralabrax maculatofasciatus (spotted sand bass) moved between the sites after translocation. Feeding guild and associated foraging behavior were found to greatly influence a species' connectivity potential, with estuarine resident ambush predators moving between sites less frequently compared to roving forager marine migrant predators. Time spent moving between sites was not significantly different among species, and 67% of homing fish completed the transit in < 3 d. Fish showed no preference for one site over the other and returned to each site equally. Stable isotope analysis revealed that the availability of food (as indicated by diets) in each restored estuary could have affected Mustelus californicus (gray smoothhound) habitat use.

Without dispersal, the Gordon-Schaefer harvesting model predicts that as the protected area increases, population abundance increases too but the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) decreases. This article shows that dispersal can change this prediction. For density independent balanced and fast dispersal, neither the MSY, nor population abundance depends on the protected area. For fast and unbalanced dispersal both the MSY and equilibrium population abundance are unimodal functions of the protected area size. For density dependent dispersal which is in direction of increasing fitness predictions depend on whether individuals react to mortality risk in harvested patch. When animals disregard harvesting risk, the results are similar to the case of density independent and balanced dispersal. When animals do consider harvesting risk, the results are similar to the case without dispersal. The models considered also show that dispersal reduces beneficial effect of protected areas, because population abundance is smaller when compared with no dispersal case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Migratory fish are important ecosystem components, and yet there are many gaps in our knowledge of migratory fish life history and their relationship with hydrological processes. Consequently, few mechanisms are available to promote their conservation. An emergent tool is the Freshwater Protected Area (FPA), a zone of restricted use and access within freshwater systems analogous to terrestrial or marine protected areas that aim to conserve constituent resources. These protected areas are often criticized for their inability to control pollution inputs and their tendency to be implemented only as components of terrestrial parks, meaning that they traditionally do not reflect the importance of aquatic systems or promote connectivity. This paper reassesses FPAs in the context of migratory fish conservation and addresses a variety of obstacles inhibiting FPAs from being suitable for protecting migratory fishes.

We reviewed life history-based predictions about the vulnerability of different groups of coral reef fish and examined the empirical evidence for different rates of population recovery inside no-take marine reserves to (1) determine if the empirical data agree with predictions about vulnerability and (2) show plausible scenarios of recovery within fully protected reserves and periodically-harvested fishery closures. In general, larger-bodied carnivorous reef fishes are predicted to be more vulnerable to fishing while smaller-bodied species lower in the food web (e.g., some herbivores) are predicted to be less vulnerable. However, this prediction does not always hold true because of the considerable diversity of life history strategies in reef fishes. Long-term trends in reef fish population recovery inside no-take reserves are consistent with broad predictions about vulnerability, suggesting that moderately to highly vulnerable species will require a significantly longer time (decades) to attain local carrying capacity than less vulnerable species. We recommend: (1) expanding age-based demographic studies of economically and ecologically important reef fishes to improve estimates of vulnerability; (2) long term (20-40 years), if not permanent, protection of no-take reserves to allow full population recovery and maximum biomass export; (3) strict compliance to no-take reserves to avoid considerable delays in recovery; (4) carefully controlling the timing and intensity of harvesting periodic closures to ensure long-term fishery benefits; (5) the use of periodically-harvested closures together with, rather than instead of, permanent no-take reserves.",53,2014,10.1007/s11160-014-9362-x,WOS:000344783400004,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,about MPA effect on recovery inside MPAs

Consequently, reserves have been implemented in an attempt to reduce the threat to freshwater biodiversity. However, few studies have evaluated how effective these protected areas (PA) are for the conservation of freshwater organisms. In the present study, we compared species richness, community composition and density of small-bodied fishes between lagoons within an eight-year-old reserve (i.e. protected lagoons) with those outside the reserve (i.e. unprotected lagoons) in a river-floodplain system that is exposed to seasonal flooding.

Our results showed no differences between the lagoons inside the reserve with those outside in any of the community properties measured. However, we registered an overall tendency of abundance reduction among the species used as baits in unprotected lagoons. Considering the high degree of oversight in the PA and the low fishing pressure among unprotected lagoons, it is possible that the positive effects promoted by the reserve on fish assemblages are being exported towards unprotected lagoons and thus offsetting a portion of the anthropogenic impacts.

A case studies analysis of potential spillover effect from marine protected areas, using food web models",.,.,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are implemented worldwide as an efficient tool to preserve biodiversity and protect ecosystems. We used food web models (Ecopath and EcoTroph) to assess the ability of MPAs to reduce fishing impacts on targeted resources and to provide biomass exports for adjacent fisheries. Three coastal MPAs: Bonifacio and Port-Cros (Mediterranean Sea), and Bamboung (Senegalese coast), were used as case studies. Pre-existing related Ecopath models were homogenized and ecosystem characteristics were compared based on network indices and trophic spectra analyses. Using the EcoTroph model, we simulated different fishing mortality scenarios and assessed fishing impacts on the three ecosystems. Lastly, the potential biomass that could be exported from each MPA was estimated. Despite structural and functional trophic differences, the three MPAs showed similar patterns of resistance to simulated fishing mortalities, with the Bonifacio case study exhibiting the highest potential catches and a slightly inferior resistance to fishing. We also show that the potential exports from our small size MPAs are limited and thus may only benefit local fishing activities. Based on simulations, their potential exports were estimated to be at the same order of magnitude as the amount of catch that could have been obtained inside the reserve. In Port Cros, the ban of fishing inside MPA could actually allow for improved catch yields outside the MPA due to biomass exports. This was not the case for the Bonifacio site, as its potential exports were too low to offset catch losses. This insight suggests the need for MPA networks and/or sufficiently large MPAs to effectively protect juveniles and adults and provide important exports. Finally, we discuss the effects of MPAs on fisheries that were not considered in food web models, and conclude by suggesting possible improvements in the analysis of MPA efficiency.

Sensitivity analysis examined the influence of larval dispersal, and simulations included combinations of MPA location (which population was protected) and three fishing mortality rates for non-MPA populations: low (4%), medium (8%) and high (30%); no fishing was allowed in the MPAs.Results showed (i) salinity-driven changes in larval dispersal led to relatively small, population-specific connectivity changes, (ii) MPAs can enhance the frequency of genotypes originating within protected populations in unprotected populations when fishing rates are high (30%), and (iii) demographic shifts can impose temporal variability on the influence of MPAs on connectivity.These results suggest that genetic consequences of siting MPAs must be considered in terms of present population and environmental conditions, as well as allowing for changes in population and genetic connectivity that may shift fundamentally over time.Simulation results indicate that siting protected areas for oyster restoration in low salinity (<12ppt) regions may interact with development of disease resistance in the metapopulation by altering genotype transfer from protected to unprotected downestuary populations.

Here we consider how mismanaged a fishery must be before spillover from a reserve is able to provide a net benefit for a fishery. For our model fishery, density of the species being harvested becomes higher in the reserve than in the fished area but the reduction in the density and yield of the fished area was such that the net effect of the closure was negative, except when the fishery was mismanaged. The extent to which effort had to exceed traditional management targets before reserves led to a spillover benefit varied with rates of growth and movement of the model species. In general, for well-managed fisheries, the loss of yield from the use of reserves was less for species with greater movement and slower growth. The spillover benefit became more pronounced with increasing mis-management of the stocks remaining available to the fishery. This model-based result is consistent with the literature of field-based research where a spillover benefit from reserves has only been detected when the fishery is highly depleted, often where traditional fisheries management controls are absent. We conclude that reserves in jurisdictions with well-managed fisheries are unlikely to provide a net spillover benefit.",46,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0107032,WOS:000341271500110,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,spillover benefits on fisheries

We examine the stability and sensitivity of the equilibria of the modelled system with regards to key system parameters and find that for a reasonable set of parameters, populations can be protected from a collapse if a small percentage of the total area is set aside in reserves. Furthermore, the overall abundance of the population is predicted to achieve a maximum at a certain ratio of reserve area to fished area, which depends heavily on the other system parameters such as the net export rate of fish from the marine reserves to the fished areas. This finding runs contrary to the contested equivalence at best result when comparing fishery management through traditional catch or effort control and management through marine reserves. Lastly, we analyse the problem from a bioeconomics perspective by computing the optimal harvesting policy using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, which suggests that the value for which maximizes the optimal equilibrium fishery yield also maximizes population abundance when the cost per unit harvest is constant, but can increase substantially when the cost per unit harvest increases with the area being harvested.",3,2014,10.1007/s11538-014-0003-2,WOS:000341734600002,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

We followed a multidisciplinary approach that merged detailed descriptions of fishing zones and spawning time at 17 sites distributed in the Midriff Island region of the Gulf of California with a biophysical oceanographic model that simulated larval transport at Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) 14, 21 and 28 days for the most common and targeted predatory reef fish, (leopard grouper Mycteroperca rosacea). We tested the hypothesis that source-sink larval metapopulation dynamics describing the direction and frequency of larval dispersal according to an oceanographic model can help to explain empirical genetic data. We described modeled metapopulation dynamics using graph theory and employed empirical sequence data from a subset of 11 sites at two mitochondrial genes to verify the model predictions based on patterns of genetic diversity within sites and genetic structure between sites. We employed a population graph describing a network of genetic relationships among sites and contrasted it against modeled networks. While our results failed to explain genetic diversity within sites, they confirmed that ocean models summarized via graph and adjacency distances over modeled networks can explain seemingly chaotic patterns of genetic structure between sites. Empirical and modeled networks showed significant similarities in the clustering coefficients of each site and adjacency matrices between sites. Most of the connectivity patterns observed towards downstream sites (Sonora coast) were strictly asymmetric, while those between upstream sites (Baja and the Midriffs) were symmetric. The best-supported gene flow model and analyses of modularity of the modeled networks confirmed a pulse of larvae from the Baja Peninsula, across the Midriff Island region and towards the Sonoran coastline that acts like a larval sink, in agreement with the cyclonic gyre (anti-clockwise) present at the peak of spawning (May-June). Our approach provided a mechanistic explanation of the location of fishing zones: most of the largest areas where fishing takes place seem to be sustained simultaneously by high levels of local retention, contribution of larvae from upstream sites and oceanographic patterns that concentrate larval density from all over the region. The general asymmetry in marine connectivity observed highlights that benefits from reserves are biased towards particular directions, that no-take areas need to be located upstream of targeted fishing zones, and that some fishing localities might not directly benefit from avoiding fishing within reserves located adjacent to their communities.

On biweekly time scales we observed directional variability in alongshore current data and larval dispersal trajectories; if viewed in isolation these data suggest the system behaves as a source-sink metapopulation.

We used a biophysical model to simulate dispersal of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, larvae and connectivity among a network of 10 no-take reserves in a shallow, wind-driven estuary to assess the relative importance of spawning location, spawning date, larval behavior, larval mortality, and adult reproductive output to predicted dispersal and connectivity patterns. The location (i.e., natal reserve) and date of spawning relative to physical processes, particularly frequency of wind reversals, were the dominant drivers of dispersal and connectivity patterns. To a lesser extent, larval behavior (i.e., 3D vertical advection and ontogenetic depth regulation) and mortality modified dispersal and connectivity, whereas spatiotemporal variability in adult reproductive output was of minimal importance. Over a 21-day larval duration, mean dispersal distance of passive surface particles ranged from 5 to 40km. Reserves were too small (1km2) relative to mean dispersal distances to promote extensive local retention (median 2%) and spaced too far apart (typically similar to 50km) to promote extensive inter-reserve connectivity (median 2%). Limited connectivity and local retention may preclude the network from being self-sustainable, thereby limiting its long-term conservation and management benefits.

Although traditional population-genetic tools can be applied to infer movement of larvae on an evolutionary timescale, large effective population sizes and high rates of gene flow present serious challenges to documenting dispersal patterns over shorter, ecologically relevant, timescales. Here, we address these challenges by combining direct parentage analysis and indirect genetic analyses over a 4-year period to document spatial and temporal patterns of larval dispersal in a common coral-reef fish: the bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus). At four island locations surrounding Exuma Sound, Bahamas, including a long-established marine reserve, we collected 3278 individuals and genotyped them at 10 microsatellite loci. Using Bayesian parentage analysis, we identified eight parent-offspring pairs, thereby directly documenting dispersal distances ranging from 0 km (i.e., self-recruitment) to 129 km (i.e., larval connectivity). Despite documenting substantial dispersal and gene flow between islands, we observed more self-recruitment events than expected if the larvae were drawn from a common, well-mixed pool (i.e., a completely open population). Additionally, we detected both spatial and temporal variation in signatures of sweepstakes and Wahlund effects. The high variance in reproductive success (i.e., 'sweepstakes') we observed may be influenced by seasonal mesoscale gyres present in the Exuma Sound, which play a prominent role in shaping local oceanographic patterns.

All the studied MPAs, except one where no grouper was observed, were able to maintain high abundance, biomass and mean weight of groupers. Size classes were more evenly distributed inside than outside MPAs. In two reserves, biomass gradients could be detected through the boundaries of the reserve as an indication of spillover. In some cases, habitat structure appeared to exert a great influence on grouper abundance, biomass and mean individual weight, influencing the gradient shape.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape.

Scalloped hammerhead sharks are known to school in great numbers at small islands and seamounts in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and are very susceptible to fisheries while moving into the open sea. It is, therefore, essential to understand hammerhead inter-island movements and environmental effects to provide baseline information for their conservation and management within and beyond an insular marine protected area. Movements of scalloped hammerheads were analyzed in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) and ETP, and environmental factors were linked to their movements. Hammerheads were tagged (N = 134) with V16 coded pingers (July 2006 to July 2010) in the northern Galapagos and detected at listening stations around four islands in the GMR and two isolated islands in the ETP, 700 and 1,200 km away. Hammerheads formed daytime schools at specific locations, but dispersed at night. Overall, more daytime than nighttime detections were recorded at all receivers in the northern Galapagos Islands, and more detections in the up-current sides of these islands. Hammerheads remained more days at the northern islands during part of the warm season (December-February) compared to the cool; however, fewer individuals were present in March-June. Movement modes were diel island excursions (24-h cycles) in the northern Galapagos and inter-island in the GMR and ETP at different scales: (1) short back-and-forth (< 50 km, SBF), < 5 days cycles, (2) medium distance (50-300 km, MDT), 5-20 days, and (3) long distance (> 300 km, LDT), 15-52 days. The high degree of inter-island connectivity of hammerheads within the northern GMR is striking compared to the almost nil movement to the central GMR. A seasonal migratory pattern to locations offshore is indicated by (1) fewer hammerheads observed in the northern GMR during part of the warm season (March-June) and (2) evidence of LDT movements from the northern GMR to other islands in the ETP. LDT movements of mature female hammerheads are possibly associated with pupping areas. Our results indicate that currents, season, and individual behavior mainly drive inter-island movements of hammerheads at small (SBF) and medium (MDT) scales.

Understanding the role of spatial patterns of compounded disturbances in determining invader establishment and spread can enhance the effectiveness of control strategies. Using the framework of 1/f noise models and by means of a field experiment, we evaluated how the simultaneous exposure of Posidonia oceanica meadows to disturbances (namely overgrazing and rhizome uprooting from vessel anchoring) differing in spatial extent and degree of autocorrelation influenced the establishment and spread of the invasive seaweed, Caulerpa racemosa. Effects on invader establishment and spread were evaluated by means of mixed-effect models relating spatial patterns of disturbance and presence or abundance of C.racemosa, quantified through spectral coefficients. The spatial distribution of C.racemosa mimicked that of overgrazing, both variables showing positive autocorrelation. Yet, C.racemosa was unable to disperse from disturbed patches into adjacent intact areas. The uprooting of rhizomes did not promote the establishment of C.racemosa, but magnified (similar or equal to 18 times) the proliferation of the exotic seaweed when coupled with overgrazing.Synthesis and applications. Fish overgrazing of Posidoniaoceanica lessens the resistance of seagrass beds to invasion by Caulerparacemosa. Thus, conservation strategies (e.g. marine protected areas) aiming to restore over-exploited fish populations may indirectly enhance the susceptibility of P.oceanica meadows to invasion by C.racemosa. Uprooting of P.oceanica rhizomes, such as that caused by boat anchoring, exacerbates the effects of overgrazing. The anchoring of recreational vessels should be, therefore, strictly regulated in areas characterized by intense grazing of P.oceanica leaves.

However, these benefits are often small and vary among the different scenarios and as a function of sexual ontogeny. In all scenarios, increases in yield-per-recruit do not occur or are negligible. The long-term yield increases due to spawning aggregation reserves may still occur, but only if spawning-stock biomass recovery results in a recruitment subsidy.

The paired genetic differentiation index between regions (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.008) was lower than the global index (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.027), suggesting that the stronger restrictions to gene flow may be located inside the regions rather than between them. The AMOVA results supported this explanation, as the differences were only non-significant between regions. In the VRS, Santiaguillo reef was associated with low genetic connectivity levels, whilst within the MC region the group formed by Chinchorro Bank and Cozumel exhibited a restriction to gene flow with Puerto Morelos, their northernmost reef. Despite their spatial separation, reefs from different regions (Puerto Morelos and Anegada de Adentro) showed the lowest, albeit significant, genetic difference, meaning that a subtle genetic connectivity exists at the regional scale.

Our focus was to study the effects of local hydrodynamics, contrasting larval vertical behaviours and changing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles (via their effect on wind forcing) on the potential larval supply to adjacent non-protected areas. The model suggests the CROP marine reserve provides significant larval subsidies within a relatively small scale (<= 40 km), the details of which depend on larval behaviour and ENSO patterns. Changing ENSO patterns mostly affected the dispersal direction of larvae, while larval behaviour was a strong driver only under La Nina conditions. Modelling suggests that under El Nino conditions, snapper larvae are more likely to settle successfully and hence make a strong contribution to surrounding fished stocks. Understanding the contribution of MPAs to fisheries management will require multiple approaches. Modelling will help identify the strength of contributing physical and biological factors, and in due course enable site-and time-specific examples of larval subsidy to be generalised.",9,2014,10.3354/meps10973,WOS:000345703500016,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,effect of physical parameters on connectivity

We used a particle-tracking scheme based on the outputs of a three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic model to assess the spatial domain to which the island exports larvae as well as larvae retention. We modeled the release of passive particles from locations around the island during the four release dates (May 15 and 31, and June 14 and 30), matching the lunar phases and the peak of the reproductive season for several commercial invertebrates and fish, at the time when currents in the Gulf typically reverse. For each simulation we analyzed the data at 15,20 and 30 days after the release to represent different planktonic propagule durations. Particle dispersion was highly dynamic and spread over similar to 600 km along the coast over the study period. Overall, we observed potential ecological connectivity with a few key distant fishing sites that changed trough time, and potential genetic connectivity towards many near and distant sites, including all neighboring Marine Protected Areas, although not simultaneously. The percentages of particles remaining within the boundaries of the island tended to decline from May to June, and decreased with delayed planktonic propagule duration. The design of effective Marine Protected Areas should acknowledge the dynamic nature of connectivity patterns, for instance, by establishing adaptive network reserves to respond to changing ocean features that match reproductive patterns of target species and fisheries behavior.

Both genetic and simulation studies were temporarily replicated during two consecutive years.ResultsThe overall genetic homogeneity observed indicates that the TGMPA is not isolated and that there is genetic connectivity among locations across a scale of at least similar to 200km. A high degree of connectivity between the TGMPA and neighbouring areas is in agreement with Lagrangian simulations, which indicate that white sea bream larvae can be transported over large distances up to about 300km.

Motivations for quantifying dispersal range from biodiversity conservation to the design of marine reserves and the mitigation of species invasions. Here we compare estimates of real particle dispersion in a coastal marine environment with similar estimates provided by hydrodynamic modelling. We do so by using a system of magnetically attractive particles (MAPs) and a magnetic-collector array that provides measures of Lagrangian dispersion based on the time-integration of MAPs dispersing through the array. MAPs released as a point source in a coastal marine location dispersed through the collector array over a 5-7 d period. A virtual release and observed (real-time) environmental conditions were used in a high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to estimate the dispersal of virtual particles (VPs). The number of MAPs captured throughout the collector array and the number of VPs that passed through each corresponding model location were enumerated and compared. Although VP dispersal reflected several aspects of the observed MAP dispersal, the comparisons demonstrated model sensitivity to the small-scale (random-walk) particle diffusivity parameter (K-p). The one-dimensional dispersal kernel for the MAPs had an e-folding scale estimate in the range of 5.19-11.44 km, while those from the model simulations were comparable at 1.89-6.52 km, and also demonstrated sensitivity to K-p. Variations among comparisons are related to the value of K-p used in modelling and are postulated to be related to MAP losses from the water column and (or) shear dispersion acting on the MAPs; a process that is constrained in the model. Our demonstration indicates a promising new way of 1) quantitatively and empirically estimating the dispersal kernel in aquatic systems, and 2) quantitatively assessing and (or) improving regional hydrodynamic models.

A monitoring programme was set up to study the populations in the NTZ and in a reference area east of Gotland where the fishing pressure was high. The programme included fishing with multimesh survey nets, modelling of potential larval export and estimation of fish consumption by large marine predators. Overall, the results showed a clear positive effect of the NTZ on turbot Scophthalmus maximus, with higher densities in the closed area compared with the fished area and also higher densities after closure compared with before. The NTZ also had older individuals and a more even sex ratio. This, in combination with a high potential for larval export from the NTZ to Gotland, shows that the marine reserve may be important for maintaining a viable S. maximus stock at Gotland. Also, for flounder Platichthys flesus, the densities were higher in the NTZ compared to the reference area and there was a net larval export to the fished area. For both species, density-dependent growth was evident, with a lower length at age in the closed area. Potential predation by grey seal Halichoerus grypus and great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinesis on flatfishes, that could hamper the evaluation of the marine reserve, was also addressed. Taken together, the results show that there are clear benefits of the fishing ban for both flatfish species within the NTZ, while the net effects on fisheries are difficult to quantify.",18,2013,10.1111/jfb.12097,WOS:000325140100013,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,part on larval dispersal is a model

Within adequately protected reserves, the abundance, mean size and age of targeted fish and invertebrate species are often increased. However, the magnitude and rate of recovery within reserves varies among locations and species, and increases in abundance in reserves are not universal. One potential contributing factor to variability in reserve performance is spatial variability in the supply of recruits. Many reef fish species exhibit disproportionate levels of recruitment in relatively small areas (so-called recruitment hotspots). Here we tested the hypothesis that the presence of recruitment hotspots enhances the effectiveness of reserves for two important fishery species, coral trout (Plectropomus maculatus) and stripey snapper (Lutianus carponotatus), on coral reefs of the Keppel Island group, Great Barrier Reef. To do this we compared fish densities in areas that did or did not contain previously identified recruitment hotspots, both inside and outside reserves. For both species, the mean densities of adult fish above the minimum legal size were approximately three times as high in reserves with hotspots than in reserves without hotspots. Furthermore, the mean densities in reserves without hotspots were similar to those in nearby areas that were open to fishing. In contrast, the densities of sub-legal size individuals of both species were primarily explained by the presence of recruitment hotspots, irrespective of reserve protection. Our results suggest that identifying and incorporating recruitment hotspots into the selection of sites for reserves could enhance both conservation and fisheries objectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three of these species (Epinephelus marginatus, Diplodus cervinus and Dicentrachus labrax) have practically reached carrying capacity in the Medes Islands MPA, while others are still approaching population stabilization (Sciaena umbra) or are still increasing in biomass (Dentex dentex). The one exception to these trends is S. aurata, which tended to decrease inside the MPA, probably due to fishing just outside its borders. These results confirm that fish populations may require decadal time scales to recover from exploitation, both in terms of total abundance (21 to 29 y to exceed 95% K) as well as total biomass (25 to 35 y), and that rates of recovery differ between species (13 to 31 y).

Settlement was seasonal with greater species richness and abundance in summer.

For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20% of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf.

Here we use age-structured models of a generic fish population to analyze the short-term transient response. We show that it may take decades for a fished population to reach postreserve equilibrium. In the meantime, short-term transient dynamics dominate. During the transient phase, population abundance could either remain unchanged, decrease, or exhibit single-generation oscillations, regardless of the eventual long-term result. Such transient dynamics are longer and more oscillatory for populations with heavier fishing, older ages at maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower larval connectivity.

Here we investigate the genetic population structure of the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in French Polynesia. Five demes were sampled from five islands with different inter-island distances (50-1500 km). Whether dispersal occurs between islands frequently enough to prevent moderate genetic structure is unknown. We used 11 microsatellites loci from 165 individuals and a strong genetic structure was found among demes with both F-statistics and Bayesian approaches. This differentiation is correlated with the geographic distance between islands. It is likely that the genetic structure seen is the result of all or some combination of the following: low gene flow, time since divergence, small effective population sizes, and the standard issues with the extent to which mutation models actually fit reality. We suggest low levels of gene flow as at least a partial explanation of the level of genetic structure seen among the sampled blacktip demes. This explanation is consistent with the ecological traits of blacktip reef sharks, and that the suitable habitat for blacktips in French Polynesia is highly fragmented. Evidence for spatial genetic structure of the blacktip demes we studied highlights that similar species may have populations with as yet undetected or underestimated structure.

For example, by acting as source populations, MPAs may provide a spillover of adults/propagules, enhancing recruitment to surrounding, non-protected waters. However, such positive effect will depend on how a MPAs design matches population biology and dispersal abilities of the target species. High levels of intraspecific genetic diversity without pronounced structure have been found in many marine organisms over large spatial scales (from hundreds to thousands kilometres) but do not hold for other ecologically and economically important species such as coral reef fishes, seagrasses and kelps. In particular, the limited potential for dispersal of many macroalgae suggests the occurrence of self-sustaining, closed populations that contrast with the open populations of many fishes and invertebrates. Consequently, the high resilience of fish/invertebrate populations cannot be generalized to the whole marine realm. In the present work, we use genetic tools to explore the role of the MPA Parc naturel marin d'Iroise in the management of the emblematic kelp Laminaria digitata. While kelps have received much more scientific attention than any other seaweed group, there is still critical baseline knowledge which needs to be addressed for their effective management.

Estimating such relationship is critical for informing the management and conservation of exploited species because it determines a natural population's response to exploitation. In the current study, recruitment rates of abalone Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata were recorded by means of postlarval collectors inside and outside 2 marine reserves in 2 subsequent years. At the same time and locations, theoretical reproductive outputs were computed by combining estimates of abalone densities and size structure with literature data on size-dependent fecundity and size at sexual maturity. We found that observed settlement rates correlated positively and significantly with estimated reproductive output, suggesting that greater production of eggs by large and fecund individuals can result in predictably high recruitment rates.

Experimental tests for density dependence are lacking for large-bodied, harvested fish because of the difficulty of manipulating population density over large areas. We studied a harvested coral reef fish, Lutjanus apodus (schoolmaster snapper), using eight large, isolated natural reefs (0.4-1.6 ha) in the Bahamas as replicates. An initial observational test for density dependence was followed by a manipulation of population density. The manipulation weakened an association between density and shelter-providing habitat features and revealed a positive effect of population density on recruitment and survival (inverse density dependence), but no effect of density on somatic growth. The snappers on an individual reef were organized into a few shoals, and we hypothesize that large shoals on high-density reefs were less vulnerable to large piscivores (groupers and barracudas) than the small shoals on low-density reefs.

For arc-eye hawkfish, the numerically dominant species, recruitment (defined as the contribution of young-of-year to the benthic population within several months after settlement from the water column) varied 7-fold among years averaged over sites. Nonetheless, recruitment also differed spatially, with sites along the Kohala Peninsula comprising a high recruitment group. Spatial differences were persistent (some sites predictably low, others predictably high) and generally lacked demonstrable variation over time. Complementary em pirical data suggested that post-settlement processes (predation, interspecific competition) also affected recruitment. A dispersal model combined with currents from an oceanic circulation model (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, HYCOM) was used to simulate the spatial patterns of settlement by larvae released throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. These simulations generally agreed with observed spatial patterns of recruitment. Greater recruitment was also predicted near geomorphological features (headlands) on Hawaii Island most influenced by the flow of surface eddy currents generated by prevailing E-NE trade winds. Empirical data and simulations together suggest that the headlands of west Hawaii Island likely enhance recruitment by intercepting or concentrating larvae at greater rates, but that post-settlement processes dampen variations in settlement.

Overall, our results showed a clear partitioning of genetic variation within this area; all populations were separated from one another, except the 2 southernmost islands. This genetic subdivision could be due to a 'sweepstakes reproductive effect' (i.e. only a small proportion of the available gene pool successfully contributes to the replenishment of each population). Furthermore, the lack of a pattern of isolation by distance, coupled with a low percentage of individuals assigned to their own populations, indicates that retention of larvae near the parent population is unlikely to be the main cause of the recorded genetic structure. However, we also found evidence of past demographic events in all populations, which may have played a pivotal role in shaping the recorded pattern of intraspecific differentiation. Finally, we did not detect any difference in the level of genetic variation between populations that were protected (i.e. experiencing less human pressure) and those that were unprotected.

A total of 2,596 oysters were collected using scuba from six reserves in Pamlico Sound, NC, during 2006 to 2008 and processed in the laboratory for fecundity. Per-capita fecundity ranged from 0-340,500 eggs, and increased exponentially with oyster size, peaking in May of all years. In general, per-capita fecundity was highest at more inland mesohaline reserves, whereas reproductive potential per square meter and reserve reproductive potential were highest at more seaward polyhaline reserves as a result of a combination of relatively high density, and large oyster size and reserve areas. All 3 reproductive metrics increased in general over time. These results suggest that inland broodstock reserves should be prioritized for stock enhancement/seeding and more seaward reserves for reserve expansion and highlight the need to consider spatiotemporal variation and the scale at which a key demographic rate (fecundity and reproductive potential) is expressed when assessing the efficacy and conservation/restoration targets of marine reserves.",25,2012,10.2983/035.031.0420,WOS:000313389200020,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Networks of appropriately sized and spaced reserves can capture a high proportion of species diversity, with gene flow among reserves presumed to promote long term resilience of populations to spatially variable threats. However, numerically rare small range species distributed among isolated locations appear to be at particular risk of extinction and the likely benefits of MPA networks are uncertain. Here we use mitochondrial and microsatellite data to infer evolutionary and contemporary gene flow among isolated locations as well as levels of self-replenishment within locations of the endemic anemonefish Amphiprion mccullochi, restricted to three MPA offshore reefs in subtropical East Australia. We infer high levels of gene flow and genetic diversity among locations over evolutionary time, but limited contemporary gene flow amongst locations and high levels of self-replenishment (68 to 84%) within locations over contemporary time. While long distance dispersal explained the species' integrity in the past, high levels of self-replenishment suggest locations are predominantly maintained by local replenishment. Should local extinction occur, contemporary rescue effects through large scale connectivity are unlikely.

While a few showed rapid (within 1-2 years of protection) increases in abundance, others showed little response even after a decade of protection. Some reserves displayed little initial recovery, then a sudden increase following several years of protection, while others displayed significant declines in abundance following initial recovery. Marine reserves located in areas with initially high densities of juveniles tended to have rapid recovery, but aspects of reserve design had no significant influence on the recovery rate. Variability among recovery trajectories also suggests that supply-side dynamics may be a key driver of lobster recovery. Densities of legal-sized lobsters were positively correlated with reserve age, but the abundance of juvenile lobsters increased in all but one reserve, indicating enhanced recruitment, survival and/or movement of juvenile lobsters into reserves. It is important to consider the placement of reserves, with respect to potential levels of larval supply, when establishing marine reserves for either conservation or fisheries management purposes and for evaluating their effectiveness.",17,2012,10.1017/S037689291200015X,WOS:000308573400011,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves [5-8], the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown [4, 9-11]. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In a 1,000 km(2) study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83% (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55% (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28% of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30 km.

We replicated 3-dimensional wind-driven circulation patterns in Pamlico Sound (PS), North Carolina, USA using a numerical hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC, ADvanced CIRCulation) in conjunction with a particle-tracking model (PTM) to predict larval dispersal of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and estimate connectivity among a network of ten no-take oyster broodstock reserves in PS to inform restoration efforts. ADCIRC was forced with wind observations, which were predominately southwesterly during May-November 2007 when oyster larvae were dispersing in PS. Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers and surface drifters were used to validate ADCIRC-predicted current velocities and PTM-predicted larval dispersal, respectively. ADCIRC reliably predicted current velocities at different locations in PS, especially currents near-surface (R = 0.6, lags < 2 h). The PTM accurately predicted (R > 0.5) the total and net distance transported by drifters, which ranged from 1 to 63 km and 0.3-42 km, respectively over <= 7 days. Potential oyster larval connectivity was not uniform among broodstock reserves in PS. Of the 100 possible connections, 24 were present. Eight of the 10 reserves provided >= one inter-reserve connection, with 4 being the most. Self-recruitment occurred at all but one reserve. Spatial variation in the degree of potential oyster larval connectivity in PS, combined with evidence for spatiotemporal dynamics of oyster populations, provides strong evidence for an oyster metapopulation and possibly source-sink dynamics within the network of no-take reserves.

Moreover, their perceptions may be relevant for monitoring the effects of MPAs on extractive activities. This study analyzes artisanal fishers' perceptions of the performance of a north-western Mediterranean coastal MPA, which encompasses two no-take zones (NTZs). Three viewpoints have been considered: the effect on the personal activity of fishers, the effect on the local fishery and the effect on the ecosystem. In order to test the hypothesis that biomass export (spillover) - which had previously been evidenced from the two NTZs - may influence fishers' perceptions of NTZ effects, fishers' perceptions were compared with both declared and observed fishing activity over an one-year period.The results show that negative perceptions of NTZs are either nil or are negligible. Most fishers are aware of the beneficial effects of NTZs on ecosystems and fisheries. However, they remain to be convinced of the beneficial effects of the NTZs on their own activity. For instance, the proximity of a NTZ appears never to be involved in the choice of a fishing spot. This partial lack of correspondence between scientific expectation and fishers' perceptions is discussed in the light of fishing habits in the zone adjacent to NTZs, and takes into account fishing grounds, targeted species and seniority (defined as the number of years the fisher has been fishing within the MPA). All three factors appear to influence fishers' perceptions. For example, having a positive perception about a NTZ and spending more time fishing in the adjacent zone are habits that can be associated with fishers with less seniority. Fishers' perceptions obviously indicate the social acceptance of the MPA and are an essential monitoring tool for MPA managers. However, perceptions cannot be seen as a substitute for scientific monitoring, as both approaches are clearly complementary.

Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to demonstrate that patterns of self-recruitment of two reef fishes (Amphiprion percula and Chaetodon vagabundus) in an MPA in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were remarkably consistent over several years. However, dispersal from this reserve to two other nodes in an MPA network varied between species and through time.

A field survey showed that both invertebrates and fish differed in their larval depth distribution, ranging from surface waters to >100 m. A biophysical model of larval dispersal in the Baltic Sea showed that decreased depth distribution increased average dispersal distance 2.5-fold, decreased coastal retention and local recruitment, and substantially increased connectivity. Together with pelagic larval duration (PLD), depth distribution explained 80% of total variation in dispersal distance, whereas spawning season, and geographic and annual variations in circulation had only marginal effects. Median dispersal distances varied between 8 and 46 km, with 10% of simulated trajectories dispersing 30 to 160 km depending on drift depth and PLD. In the Baltic Sea, the majority of shallow Natura 2000 MPAs are <8 km in diameter. In the present study, only 1 of the 11 assessed larval taxa would have a recruitment >10% within MPAs of this size. Connectivity between MPAs was expected to be low for most larval trait combinations. Our simulations and the empirical data suggest that the MPA size within the Natura 2000 system is considerably below what is required for local recruitment of most sessile invertebrates and sedentary fish.

We assessed whether the Cowcod Conservation Area (CCA), the largest oceanic reserve in the Southern California Bight (SCB), established to conserve cowcod Sebastes levis, protects essential spawning habitat of another overfished rock-fish, bocaccio S. paucispinis. To this end we investigated relationships between age-specific (recently hatched, preflexion and postflexion) larval distribution and abundance, environmental indicators (temperature, chlorophyll a), and depth between 2002 and 2004. Larval presence was consistently higher in the CCA than in surrounding areas of the SCB. Abundances of bocaccio larvae from all size classes peaked in 2004, which had relatively low sea surface temperature and high chlorophyll a. Depth and sea surface temperature or chlorophyll a were significantly related to the presence of recently hatched larvae, which were most common in cooler western CCA waters where chlorophyll a tended to be highest. In contrast, later stage larvae were not significantly related to depth, indicating that they had been advected from natal locations. Examination of current patterns and the distribution of older larvae suggested that the direction of larval transport varied among years, with mostly northwestward transport in 2002, a cyclonic recirculation feature that may have retained larvae within the CCA in 2003, and southwestward transport in 2004. These results demonstrate that spatial and temporal oceanographic heterogeneity affect larval distribution and transport in this region.

We quantified the spatiotemporal variation in eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica recruitment, density, growth, and survival and assessed density dependence within a network of no-take reserves in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. From 2006 to 2008, average oyster recruitment and total density increased 15- and fivefold, respectively. The unprecedentedly high oyster densities in certain reserves (up to 6,500/m(2) at the end of the study) modified demographic rates such that further density increases were regulated by density-dependent survival. Oyster demographic rates varied significantly among reserves at relatively small spatial scales (20 km). Certain reserves were the strong recruiters, others the fast growers, and yet others the high survivors. Cohort dynamics altered the demographic rank order such that the demographically best reserves varied intra- and interannually. From a management perspective, the prevalence of density-dependent survival suggests that the oysters in this system are habitat rather than recruitment limited, which may minimize the utility of stock enhancement programs. Addition of habitat (i.e., artificial reefs) should focus on reserves characterized by high recruitment but density-dependent growth and survival. This study (1) supports the efficacy of marine reserves in rapidly increasing the density and age-size structure of protected species, (2) highlights the need for spatially explicit demographic data to support multifaceted management objectives, and (3) when combined with evidence of reserve larval connectivity, provides support for applying metapopulation concepts to this reserve system.",41,2012,10.1080/19425120.2012.713892,WOS:000312007400047,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

Sediment, temperature, and algae and plant biomass floating near the bottom were relevant in driving reproductive activity and recruitment in X. kroyeri. The high reproductive potential of the studied population and the occurrence of abundant juveniles throughout the sampling area, indicating the existence of a nursery ground within the region, suggest that this MPA might provide important benefits in the near future.

We assumed that fish larvae dispersal is mainly regulated by physical transport. Currents are mainly wind driven in this area; therefore, changes in wind forcing have a first-order impact on larval transport. The synoptic wind patterns were systematically analyzed based on self-organizing map analysis. The wind fields were clustered using a neural network pattern recognition approach into two modes, producing opposite along-shelf flow. The seasonal changes between spring and summer in the dominance of either mode modulate the along-shelf circulation, producing flow shifts under some circumstances. This variability in the wind regime was consistent throughout the 10 years analyzed (20002009). Using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) and a particle-tracking algorithm, we analyzed the effect of wind-forced currents in the connectivity among near-shore habitats. We show that, at the spatial scale considered, the coastal morphology and stochastic wind forcing favor local recruitment (mean of 30% self-recruitment). Maximum transport distances of 2030 km were typically associated with particles left to drift for 21 days. The implications for the performance of the four marine protected areas near SW Mallorca Island are discussed.

Knowledge of home range size and site fidelity is essential in determining whether species will benefit from the protection offered by a MPA, the size of the area needed to protect individuals, and the extent to which surrounding unprotected areas may be supplemented through post-recruitment movement or spillover. We utilized a traditional mark and recapture approach, along with GIS spatial analysis to investigate the site fidelity, home range, and homing behavior of the economically important fish species cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) on the south central coast of California. In collaboration with members of the commercial live-fish fishery, a total of 1240 sub-adult and adult cabezon were tagged during 10 days of fishing from September to December of 2004 along similar to 18 km of coastline. A public awareness and reward program resulted in 330 total recaptures from 290 different individuals (23% recapture rate) with recaptured individuals at liberty up to 1000 days after initial tagging. A majority of individuals displayed high site fidelity, with 81% of recapture events occurring within 100 m of their initial capture locations, and only 9 individuals (.03%) recaptured greater than 1 km. Most individuals (64%) displayed home ranges less than 1000 m(2). Ten individuals recaptured after experiencing translocation of up to 5.3 km displayed strong homing behavior, returning to within 14 m of their initial capture locations. Findings suggest that under circumstances where suitable habitat is available in nearby unprotected areas, that adult spillover will likely be limited to areas within 100 m from MPA boundaries. In addition, the size of the area needed to protect individual cabezon, should be at least 1000 m(2).

Close reserve habitats also contained fewer prey fish than nonreserve locations. In contrast, fish abundance in isolated reserve habitats did not differ from similar nonreserve locations.

Surveys for queen conch Strombus gigas were made in 2011 at 2 locations in the Exuma Cays, The Bahamas, for direct comparison with surveys conducted during the early 1990s at Warderick Wells (WW) near the center of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP) and at a fished site near Lee Stocking Island (LSI). There was no change in adult conch density and abundance in the shallow bank environment at LSI where numbers were already low in 1991, but numbers declined 91% in the deeper shelf waters. At WW, the adult population declined 69% on the bank and 6% on the island shelf. Unlike observations made in the 1990s, queen conch reproductive behavior near LSI is now rare. Average age of adult conch (indicated by shell thickness) at LSI decreased significantly during the 20 yr period between surveys, while average age increased at WW and juvenile abundance decreased. These results show that the LSI population is being overfished and the WW population is senescing because of low recruitment. In 2011, the ECLSP continued to be an important source of larvae for downstream populations because of abundant spawners in the shelf environment.

Fish were visually censused in shallow rocky habitat (4-7 m depth) at replicate sites within the different MPA zones and in adjacent unprotected areas. Higher values of sea breams size, density and biomass were usually observed inside MPA compared to unprotected areas, likely due to the enforcement of protection. We found evidence of negative gradients of sea bream density and biomass across the MPA boundaries, although shape and steepness of gradients changed depending on species, sampling time and boundary orientation. Fish density and biomass decreased abruptly just 100 m outside the MPA and remained close to zero off the western boundary. A partial recovery in fish density was recorded eastward, about 1 km apart from the MPA boundary. Overall, our results were consistent with the presence of a moderate fish spillover, considering that a high fishing effort close to the MPA boundaries could have prevented any potential increase in abundance just outside the MPA.

V.","Marine protected areas export larvae of infauna, but not of bioengineering mussels to adjacent areas",.,.,"Populations of organisms that create habitat can often be fragmented throughout landscapes by anthropogenic disturbances such as harvesting and loss or change to the identity of such bioengineers may lead to large changes in biodiversity. Using the fauna associated with a bioengineer, the intertidal mussel Perna perna, we tested hypotheses about the relative importance of larval export from protected populations in marine reserves. Harvesting led to the replacement of P. perna and the domination of shores outside reserves by turf-forming coralline algae, mostly Corallina spp. We determined whether the diverse fauna recruiting onto artificial units of habitat placed within mussel beds differed between reserves and non-reserve areas or whether shores outside reserves, and open to harvesting, received recruits through larval export from reserves. Furthermore, we determined whether this was affected by the distance away from reserves and whether colonisation was achieved by movement of adults from surrounding biogenic habitats or via the plankton. Overall, we found no effect of increasing distance away from a reserve on the cover of adult mussels or associated fauna. We found strong effects of the presence of marine reserves on abundances of molluscs and polychaetes but not crustaceans. There were greater densities of molluscs in sites with a reserve (i.e. inside reserves, and up to 5 km outside reserve boundaries), but more polychaetes in exploited sites. For molluscs, this pattern was driven by gastropods rather than bivalves. Furthermore, although reserves had greater cover of adult mussels than non-reserve areas, recruitment of mussels was not greater inside or near to reserves. Our study illustrates the effectiveness of these reserves in protecting stocks of adult mussels, and although there was no evidence that reserves provided export of the larvae of mussels (the target species), they did provide larval export of non-targeted associated species. By protecting a harvested bioengineer and through export of the larvae of its associated fauna, these reserves fulfil some, but not all the conservation aims of a marine protected area.

Connectivity varied greatly among species. Connectivity was high for the subtidal macroalgae Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa and neither species showed any clear patterns of genetic structuring with geographic distance within or among marine parks. In contrast, connectivity was low for the intertidal, Hormosira banksii, and there was a strong pattern of isolation by distance. Coastal topography and latitude influenced small scale patterns of genetic structure. These results suggest that some species are well served by the current system of marine reserves in place along this temperate coast but it may be warranted to revisit protection of intertidal habitats to ensure the long-term persistence of important habitat-forming macroalgae.

We have examined four scenarios for the design and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and for each we simulated fish biomass and fish catches: (1) No MPA. (2) A single MPA located at a feeding area. (3) A single MPA designed to maximise its overlap with the predominant route of fish dispersal. (4) The use of two MPAs. Each scenario was replicated with two scenarios regarding the time that fish remains within the MPA and two grid map scenarios to account for time-space effects and map/coastline characteristics. Results showed that overall closing an area increased fish biomass. However, an MPA located in the open sea for a limited time may have adverse effects on fish biomass. MPAs increased fish catches when a single large MPA or two small MPAs were located in the open sea for a limited time. The effects of time that fish remains protected in closed areas vary in combination with the spatial design: When examining time effects on the efficacy of MPAs within each scenario with an MPA located in the open sea, fish biomass was always higher in the case where fish was protected for more calendar days during each year. When comparing between different spatial designs, proximity to the coast was a more predominant factor in the efficacy of MPAs rather than time that fish was protected. The scenario that gave the highest total fish biomass was the one that covered the largest part of the migration route, despite increased edge effects. Our results suggest that it is not per se the perimeter to surface ratio that matters, but the trade-off between edge effects and maximised MPA surface in the predominant dispersal direction.

For these spatially discrete habitats, dispersal of larvae in the plankton, settlement to the seafloor, and recruitment are processes that connect populations of benthic fauna. Knowledge of these processes is vital to understanding the resilience of vent ecosystems to disturbance or removal of sources of propagules. In particular, hydrothermal vents may be impacted by human activities including scientific research, eco-tourism, bioprospecting, and polymetallic sulfide mining. In 2009 the first Marine Protected Area (MPA) for vents in the U. S. EEZ was established as part of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument (MTMNM). The vents in this region are located along the Mariana back-arc spreading center (BASC) and volcanic arc.In 2010 we conducted the first cruise dedicated to the study of vent-endemic fauna at the southern Mariana BASC. Cruise YK10-11 on R/V Yokosuka was one of several to this region as part of the Japanese multi-disciplinary program TAIGA (Trans-crustal Advection and In-situ biogeochemical processes of Global sub-sea floor Aquifer). Larval, juvenile, and adult specimens of benthic invertebrates were collected at vents on-axis (Snail, Yamanaka) and off-axis (Archaean, Urashima, Pika) at similar to 3000-m depth. Our objectives included characterization of benthic communities, assessments of larval abundance and diversity, estimates of local-scale larval dispersal (on the order of 10 km), shipboard visualization of larval swimming behavior, and genetic diversity of populations at each vent site and genetic deviation between sites. Operations during the cruise included nine dives with the submersible Shinkai 6500 and seven deployments of subsurface moorings.These vents on the southern Mariana BASC appear to have similar macrofaunal community composition to the better-studied BASC vents similar to 600-km to the north. Benthic collections included gastropods (e. g., Alviniconcha hessleri, Phymorhynchus aff. starmeri, Shinkailepas aff. kaikatensis), barnacles (Neoverruca brachylepadoformis), shrimp (Chorocaris aff. vandoverae), and polychaetes (e. g., Paralvinella hessleri); larvae were also collected near-bottom with a slurp sampler. To further assess larval abundance and diversity, we deployed large-volume plankton pumps near three of the vents, filtering five samples of similar to 40000 L each over a 63-mu m mesh. Larvae were sorted morphologically, and selected morphotypes were identified via genetic bar-coding to phylotype and, when possible, to species. The local-scale larval dispersal study included a current meter recording near-bottom flow on-axis during the cruise. For the larval behavioral study, individual polychaete, barnacle, and gastropod larvae of several species were visualized in horizontally-and vertically-oriented chambers to measure swimming speeds at 1 atm. Local-scale population connectivity is being determined via molecular genetic analyses of mainly the benthic specimens. The population genetic study may be extended to the regional scale when linked to other analyses for specimens collected at vents elsewhere in the MTMNM, including those relatively nearby along the Mariana arc and further north on the BASC.Results of our study of larval dispersal and population connectivity at these deep-sea vents will be considered in the context of ecosystem management and protection in the MTMNM.

These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts.",59,2011,.,WOS:000293419200003,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

The objectives were to: (1) clarify the larval dispersal processes, (2) quantify the dispersal distance of larvae and (3) estimate the population connectivity. To simulate larval dispersal, particles were released at the timings of spawning estimated from the shell lengths of newly settled abalone. The larval dispersal was simulated for 2 periods. The modeled hydrodynamics in the first period simulated stormy conditions because of the passage of a low-pressure system whereas that in the second period simulated relatively calm conditions. In the first period, the spawning appeared to be triggered by the low-pressure system, and the larval dispersal was estimated to be generally greater than that in the second period. The mean dispersal distances were less than 40 km in both periods. Model results indicate that abalone in the fishery grounds on the mid-and southern coast exhibit 2 distinct larval dispersal patterns. The number of connected sites was 3 to 7 and 2 to 4 in the stormy and relatively calm conditions, respectively. The calmer hydrodynamic conditions were favorable for self-replenishment. Self-recruitment was usually greater than the connectivity with the other fishery grounds; however, poor self-recruitment occurred in some fishery grounds. This implies that the restocking and protection of local resources do not always lead to an increase in local recruitment, and it is necessary to investigate the larval dispersal processes from each larval source for successful management.",12,2011,10.3354/meps09348,WOS:000296391900012,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,model and no MPA

The purpose of this paper is to examine the possibility of MPAs as fisheries management tools through a wide range of literature analysis and to suggest necessity of fisheries purpose of MPAs in Korea.Establishment of marine protected area can accompany various economic benefits such as restoration of marine environment, preservation of habitats, promotion of marine tourism and so on. Especially, a lot of case studies suggested that MPAs may bring out benefits to the fishing industry as a result of enhanced stocks.Fisheries benefits of MPAs on targeted species include increased abundance, increased mean individual size and age, increased reproductive output, enhanced recruitment inside and outside refuge, maintenance of genetic diversity of stocks, and enhanced fishery yields in adjacent fishing grounds, so called spill-over.MPAs for ecosystem conservation and protection of coastal wetland have been applied appropriately and effectively, however, the Korean MPAs system is still detective due to absence of fisheries purpose MPAs.Finally, suggestions for Korean MPAs can be summarized as following four recommendations; to establish number of small-scale MPAs rather than few large MPAs, to designate island and its surrounding areas as reserve, to consider MPA design with stock enhancement program, and to undertake co-management with Eochon-Gye, the traditional coastal community in Korea.",0,2011,.,KJD:ART001620893,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not available in english

Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management.

However, empirical evidence for larval export has been sparse. Here we use a simple idealized coastline model to estimate the expected magnitude and spatial scale of larval export from no-take marine reserves across a range of reserve sizes and larval dispersal scales. Results suggest that, given the magnitude of increased production typically found in marine reserves, benefits from larval export are nearly always large enough to offset increased mortality outside marine reserves due to displaced fishing effort. However, the proportional increase in recruitment at sites outside reserves is typically small, particularly for species with long-distance (on the order of hundreds of kilometers) larval dispersal distances, making it very difficult to detect in field studies. Enhanced recruitment due to export may be detected by sampling several sites at an appropriate range of distances from reserves or at sites downcurrent of reserves in systems with directional dispersal. A review of existing empirical evidence confirms the model's suggestion that detecting export may be difficult without an exceptionally large differential in production, short-distance larval dispersal relative to reserve size, directional dispersal, or a sampling scheme that encompasses a broad range of distances from the reserves.",90,2010,10.1073/pnas.0907368107,WOS:000283677400012,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snapper from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.

Such issues are particularly important in species with low dispersal potential, many of which exist as genetically distinct regional stocks. The roman, Chrysoblephus laticeps, is an overexploited, commercially important sparid endemic to South Africa. Post-recruits display resident behavior and occupy small home ranges, making C. laticeps a suitable model species to study genetic structure in marine teleosts with potentially low dispersal ability. We used multilocus data from two types of highly variable genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region and seven microsatellite markers) to clarify patterns of genetic connectivity and population structure in C. laticeps using samples from two MPAs and several moderately or severely exploited regions. Despite using analytical tools that are sensitive to detect even subtle genetic structure, we found that this species exists as a single, well-mixed stock throughout its core distribution. The high levels of connectivity identified among sites support the findings of previous studies that have indicated that inshore MPAs are an adequate tool for managing overexploited temperate reef fishes. Even though dispersal of adult C. laticeps out of MPAs is limited, the fact that the large adults in these reserves produce exponentially more offspring than their smaller counterparts in exploited areas makes MPAs a rich source of recruits. We nonetheless caution against concluding that the lack of structure identified in C. laticeps and several other southern African teleosts can be considered to be representative of marine teleosts in this region in general.

The simulation results indicated that more larvae may be supplied from the wild adults inside the bay to the refugium than from the released adults. These results are consistent with the observed high abundance of wild juveniles in the refugium. Most larvae from the refugium were predicted to disperse out of the bay. We found that larval retention in the bay was at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the refugium. Thus, it may be more effective in terms of self-replenishment and reproduction if the refugium were to be expanded to the bay scale.

After manipulation, fish density in the unprotected side of experimental site declined dramatically and a strong gradient was established through the boundary. One month later, this forced gradient disappeared, returning to the situation at the beginning of the study.

Because the recruitment effect is difficult to detect, spillover is presently the only tangible potential fishery benefit of MPAs. Despite abundant evidence of spillover in the literature, this is the first study to quantify the number and biomass of individuals annually spilling over from an MPA and their contribution to the local fishery catches. Using a decade (1997-2007) of tag-recapture data for the lobster Palinurus elephas from the Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (CIMR), we estimated annual emigration probabilities of 3.7% (female) and 6.7% (male), and quantified the resulting spillover to adjacent fished areas. We showed that during an 8 to 17 yr protection period, harvested spillover offset the loss of yield resulting from the reduction of fishing grounds set aside in the CIMR, producing a mean annual net benefit of 10% of the catch in weight. Although the number of lobsters spilling over annually did not quite make up for the loss of fishing grounds in the CIMR, it did in weight because the mean size of the lobsters emigrating from the reserve was larger than that of those outside.

We argue that the net larval flow (from or to the marine reserve) depends on between-area differences in the population-level biomass production rate, whereas the direction of adult flow depends on differences in the biomass standing stock. Hence, an important question is whether population-level biomass production increases (overcompensation) or decreases (undercompensation) with increased per capita mortality. We show that in a consumer-resource context, the source-sink status of an MPA may depend on the details of the individual-level bioenergetics, as well as on the dispersal rates of larvae and adults. We compare two classic bioenergetic models (net-production vs. gross-production allocation). The net-production model predicts that population-level reproduction may increase with mortality (overcompensation), whereas gross-production allocation always results in undercompensation. We show that models often implicitly assume gross-production allocation, thus potentially overestimating the capacity of MPAs to source unprotected areas.

P.",Connectivity and resilience of coral reef metapopulations in marine protected areas: matching empirical efforts to predictive needs,.,.,"Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.",216,2009,10.1007/s00338-009-0466-z,WOS:000265832100003,review,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Sampling was by annual lobster trammel net fishing, an experimental technique used inside the CIMR, and on-board commercial operations in adjacent fishing grounds. We examined trends in combined fish abundance and biomass (catch per unit effort), species richness and diversity, size structure, trophic level and species composition of the community. Our results showed the CIMR fish community continued to change throughout the study period as (1) abundance and biomass increased, (2) mean body size and trophic level increased and (3) species composition changed according to a linear model. Relative to nearby fished areas the CIMR fish community had (1) higher abundance and biomass, (2) lower species diversity and higher taxonomic distinctness, (3) larger relative body size and (4) no difference in mean trophic level. We found clear evidence of spillover of fish from the CIMR to the adjacent fishery as commercial fish yields at the MPA border (<0.5 km from the boundary) increased continuously during the study period, despite being locally depleted due to fishing effort concentration (fishing the line). Furthermore, fish size and diversity at the border were intermediate between the CIMR and other fished zones, suggesting that this is a transitional zone influenced by this MPA. Our results show that changes in community abundance, biomass, size structure and species composition provide a clear and interpretable view of MPA recovery. Diversity indices are also useful; however, their interpretation is more difficult. We conclude that the creation of the CIMR has had a positive effect on the exploitable fish community and that there is evidence of exportation of biomass to the surrounding fishery.

But for MPA networks to be successful in protecting marine populations, individual MPAs must be self-sustaining or adequately connected to other MPAs via dispersal. For marine species with a dispersive larval stage, populations within MPAs require either the return of settlement-stage larvae to their natal reserve or connectivity among reserves at the spatial scales at which MPA networks are implemented. To date, larvae have not been tracked when dispersing from one MPA to another, and the relative magnitude of local retention and connectivity among MPAs remains unknown. Here we use DNA parentage analysis to provide the first direct estimates of connectivity of a marine fish, the orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula), in a proposed network of marine reserves in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40% of A. percula larvae settling into anemones in an island MPA at 2 different times were derived from parents resident in the reserve. We also located juveniles spawned by Kimbe Island residents that had dispersed as far as 35 km to other proposed MPAs, the longest distance that marine larvae have been directly tracked. These dispersers accounted for up to 10% of the recruitment in the adjacent MPAs. Our findings suggest that MPA networks can function to sustain resident populations both by local replenishment and through larval dispersal from other reserves.

The types and quality of habitats, both inside and outside the MPAs, may determine the likelihood of migration by fish to surrounding unprotected areas where spillover to fisheries occurs. We assessed whether MPAs enhanced catches of artisanal fisheries, using an experimental fishing study with the same fishing gear as that used by local fishers. This approach allowed us to test the hypothesis of increased catches along the borders of MPAs in comparison with those in other fishing grounds located at. medium and far distances from 3 Mediterranean MPAs: Tabarca Marine Reserve, Carry-le-Rouet Marine Reserve and Cerbere-Banyuls Marine Reserve. Surveys were clone over 2 homogeneous habitats (Posidonia oceanica meadow and sand), in 3 different seasons. Catches were significantly higher for some species near the borders of the MPAs when fishing on P. oceanica meadows, but not when fishing on sandy bottoms. The spillover effect appears to be limited by a lack of continuous Suitable habitat through the boundaries of the MPA. Some of the species that showed a significant response to protection and concurrent higher catches near the MPA borders, such as Dentex dentex, Mullus surmuletus, Phycis phycis, Sciaena Umbra and Scorpaena porcus, are target species of artisanal fisheries. Although we found that the spatial scale of the spillover-induced density gradient was localized, it was sufficient to provide local benefits to artisanal fisheries.

The sanctuaries have been in existence from 3 to 30 yr; 10 sanctuaries protect constructed ('restored') oyster reefs and 1 sanctuary protects natural reefs. Measurements of vertical relief, live oyster density, recruitment, abundance of market-sized oysters, and biomass as well as disease prevalence and severity indicated that 7 of the 11 sanctuaries met criteria for minimal success by having vertical relief >20 cm in height, living oysters (>10 oysters m(-2)), and evidence of recent recruitment in 1. of 2 yr of the survey. Most reefs within the 7 sanctuaries far surpassed these relatively low benchmarks. For reefs that failed, burial by sedimentation appeared to be the primary cause in 2 sanctuaries, poor water quality (low dissolved oxygen) in 1, and poor oyster recruitment in another. All intertidal reefs were successful and had significantly higher densities of all size categories of live oysters (spat, adult, marketable size) than subtidal oyster reefs. Disease prevalence and severity were low in sanctuary reefs despite high oyster densities and increased longevity of oysters on these reefs.

We explored biophysical correlates of population substructure to determine how well pelagic larval duration (PLD) correlates with population genetic estimates of connectivity in a sample of 300 published studies drawn pseudo-randomly from about 1600 hits on electronic searches. In direct contrast to the general expectation of a strong correlation, we find that average PLD is poorly correlated (r(2) < 0.1) with genetic structure (F-ST). Furthermore, even this weak correlation is anchored by non-pelagic dispersal, because removal of the zero PLD class (direct developers) from the analysis resulted in a non-significant relationship between FST and PLD. For species in which minimum, maximum, and mean PLDs were available, it is noteworthy that both minimum and maximum PLDs are better correlated with FST than the mean larval duration, which has been used in all such previous studies. A 3-way ANCOVA reveals that genetic marker class (allozymes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA sequences), as opposed to habitat or swimming ability, explain most of the variation in F-ST (F = 7.113, df = 2, p = 0.001), with higher values Of FST obtained from mtDNA than with either microsatellites or allozymes (which were not significantly different).

Concentration of effort in the. shed zone and increased recruitment there led to reduced average size, and therefore value, of animals in the catch, as well as increased destruction of biomass by discarding undersized lobsters.

There are many examples of island MPAs across the world because of their advantages compared to mainland sites, and although evidence suggests they effectively protect biodiversity and may have localized fisheries benefits, their contribution to larval export and connectivity to mainland areas remains largely unknown; these are important aspects of MPA sustainability and functioning. Here I examined the genetic differentiation between four island MPAs in northern Europe and their respective mainlands, relative to differentiation of populations along the coast at similar spatial scales for two marine invertebrates (Semibalanus balanoides, planktonic larvae; Nucella lapillus, direct development). These data were used to infer past patterns of larval exchange between populations. Gene flow was restricted at all four locations between the islands and the mainland, compared to gene flow along the coast (for both species) and more distant islands had greater differentiation than those closer to the mainland for S. balanoides, but not for N. lapillus. My results of genetic analysis suggest that island MPAs may not provide as much larval export or receive as much buffering against local extinctions, compared with mainland populations (for a similar sized protected area). My findings are especially relevant to the creation of MPA networks and in understanding the importance of connectivity in achieving the greatest fisheries benefits and in ensuring inter-MPA linkages. Low levels of larval exchange may limit the success of any protected area and may prevent multiple conservation objectives from being achieved. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In these fisheries, catch is taken from outside NTMRs, potentially resulting in reduced abundance outside NTMRs and an overall reduction in catch. We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50% or less of the CPUE at MSY.

On Australia's east coast, a system of marine protected areas (MPA's) has been established with the aim of conserving HLRs in part by providing sources of colonizing larvae. To examine the effectiveness of existing MPAs as networks for dispersal, we compared genetic diversity within and among the HLRs in MPAs and between these HLRs and tropical reefs on the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The 2 coral species best represented on Australian HLRs (the brooding Pocillopora damicornis and the broadcast-spawning Goniastrea australensis) exhibited sharply contrasting patterns of diversity and connectedness. For P. damicornis, the 8-locus genetic and genotypic diversity declined dramatically with increasing latitude (N-a = 3.6-1.2, H-e = 0.3-0-03, N-g:N = 0.87-0.06), although population structure was consistent with recruitment derived largely from sexual reproduction (Go:G, = 1.28-0-55). Genetic differentiation was high among the HLRs (F-ST [SD] = 0.32 [0.08], p < 0.05) and between the GBR and the HLRs (F-ST = 0.24 [0.06], p < 0.05), which indicates these temperate populations are effectively closed. In contrast for G. australensis, 9-locus genetic diversity was more consistent across reefs (N-a = 4.2-3.9, H-e = 0.3-0.26, N-g:N = 1-0.61), and there was no differentiation among regions (F-ST = 0.00 [0,004], p > 0.05), which implies the HLRs and the southern GBR are strongly interconnected. Our results demonstrate that although the current MPAs appear to capture most of the genetic diversity present within the HLR systems for these 2 species, their sharply contrasting patterns of connectivity indicate some taxa, such as P. damicornis, will be more vulnerable than others, and this disparity will provide challenges for future management.",43,2008,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00985.x,WOS:000260252000020,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,.

Enhanced production inside reserves is predicted to lead to a net larval export and increased settlement and recruitment outside reserve boundaries. However, larval retention in bays is also well documented. Since bays are increasingly being used as reserve areas, planktonic larvae of benthic marine invertebrates were sampled from two semi-enclosed marine reserves during flood and ebb tides to determine whether these bays are acting as net exporters of larvae. Neither reserve was a net importer or exporter of species richness, larval abundance or diversity, although one reserve showed a small export of species richness during the hours of darkness. Both reserves balanced the net import of some species with a net export of others, which was generally related to adult or larval abundance, although exceptions were found in one reserve. Significant effects of light were found, with the net import or export of some species occurring exclusively during either the hours of daylight or darkness. An increased understanding of larval sink-source dynamics in bays is essential for ensuring their effective use as marine reserves to meet specific conservation needs.",13,2008,10.1007/s10750-008-9344-x,WOS:000254903400009,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Mussel beds are important intertidal communities in the Mediterranean Sea and have traditionally been exploited by humans.2. Marine protected areas are management tools for recovering over-fished populations, normally top predator populations, which may in turn undermine prey abundance. Therefore, mussel populations might not recover inside protected areas, as they are affected by increasing fish populations.3. To Study the effects of both human and fish predation on mussels, three locations were selected: the Reserve (R), where all types of exploitation were banned and fish were abundant; the Partial Reserve (PR), where only angling was permitted, and fish abundance was low; and the Non-Reserve (NR), where no protection existed and fish were rare,4. Data from mussel bed surveys indicate that recruitment is critical to sustain mussel populations, and similar size structures were found at all three locations. However, the overall biomass in the PR was nearly double that in both R and NR, suggesting disturbance of some sort at these latter two sites.5. A tethering experiment showed that fish predation greatly affected mussels in R, while the analysis of harvester collections from the NR showed that the most harvested size classes were those least abundant in the mussel bed.6. Both protected and non-protected areas are unable to increase mussel populations due to trophic cascade effects, while partial reserves, where fish populations are exploited and mussels protected, are areas where the Mediterranean mussel populations can recover.

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-anatysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

A box model has been applied for the estimation of residence time of the lake, forced by tides only at the open end of the lake system. The residence time of Little Lake was estimated to be 54 days. In our approach we assumed that P. nobilis larvae may be found in the surface waters only during the night, thus restricting their outgoing from the lake to about 7-8 hours per day in the June-August period, as the larvae need some time to reach surface waters. Therefore, the equivalent residence time of the larvae in Little Lake is estimated to be about 160-185 days. Knowing that the bivalve larva phase lasts between 3 and 5 weeks, one may estimate that only 11 to 22% of the larvae, respectively, leave Little Lake. From a conservation standpoint these low values imply a special level of protection within Mljet National Park. In addition, future climatic changes will affect the recruitment of P. nobilis, not only due to sea level rise but also with temperature and other changes which may influence its reproduction phase and larvae transport.",8,2008,.,WOS:000257944700005,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

Improvements in fishery yields should take place via the spill-over of individuals from the reserve. In general, it has been demonstrated that MPAs affect the density and biomass of the organisms within them, however, little evidence has been found in order to assess the exportation of individuals across their boundaries. In this study, a simple model. involving population growth, harvest, and the diffusion coefficient for individuals was used to explore the effects of protection on populations inside the reserve and the spill-over of individuals to the fished area. The model showed that biological responses inside marine reserves appear to develop quickly, reaching mean levels within a short (1-5 year) time period. Mean population abundance is always higher inside the reserve and highlights the effectiveness of protection, particularly when there is strong fishing pressure outside the reserve. However, reserves smaller than 2000m radius show significantly tower levels of abundance inside than larger sites. Large MPAs (i.e. about 2000 m in radius) offer nearly the maximum capacity for recovery (close to 100% of the system carrying capacity) and nearly the maximum flux of individuals per unit boundary length. Very large MPAs (i.e. larger than 6000m in radius) could be a guaranteed means of providing resilience in order to prevent population crises, with the added advantage that the flux of individuals is slightly higher at larger distances from the boundary. However, in practice they provide no further advantage towards increasing the density of individuals or the exportation of biomass, and a network of smaller MPAs could be more beneficial, both from the point of view of conservation and of benefits to fisheries.

The selected MPAs were Cerbere-Banyuls and Carry-le-Rouet in France, and Medes, Cabrera, Tabarca, and Cabo de Palos in Spain. These MPAs had been functional for more than 8 yr and incorporate areas of fisheries closure and restricted use where fishing is limited. We based our study on the hypotheses that, in the presence of biomass export, (1) fishing effort would concentrate close to MPA boundaries, and (2) fishery production, expressed as catch per unit area (CPUA), would be highest near MPA boundaries and decrease with distance. We selected data from 14 'fishing tactics' using gill nets, trammel nets and bottom long-lines targeting sparids, mullids, serranids, scorpaenids and palinurids. We analyzed the spatial distribution of effort, fishery production and revenues per unit area, using generalized additive models (GAMs), and we tested regression slopes of effort density and CPUA with distance to closure boundaries, using generalized linear models (GLMs). GAMs allowed us to recognize habitat discontinuities or 'hot spots' of high production in the vicinity of the MPAs, and to identify the extent of potential spillover effects in order to implement GLMs. We found evidence of effort concentration and high fishery production near fisheries closures for all fishing tactics analyzed and significant negative slopes for most. Revenues generally followed trends similar to CPUA. Significant negative slopes from GLM of effort density and CPUA with distance from fisheries closures were indicative of biomass export where habitats across closure boundaries had some degree of continuity. The spatial extent of spillover was consistent with species mobility and fisheries efficiency and extended 700 to 2500 m from fishery closure boundaries.

A review of multispecies-fisheries and marine-reserve models indicates that incorporating species interactions leads to decreased theoretical predictions for sustainable yield and harvest rates and to increased theoretical predictions for the reserve size necessary to protect populations; ontogenetic shifts in interactions also have a significant effect on multispecies model predictions. While previous models have explored negative species interactions (i.e., predation and competition), this paper presents an example marine reserve model with a positive interaction: a spiny lobster-sea urchin-red algae trophic chain where red algae facilitate lobster recruitment.

We theoretically explore this possibility through two cases: (1) marine systems in which reduced predation and/or increased feeding drive the evolution of planktonic larval duration and (2) more generally, where stochasticity in reproductive yield drives the evolution of the proportion of offspring dispersing. Model results indicate that habitat fragmentation generally shifts selection pressure toward reduced dispersal, particularly when areas outside reserves are uninhabitable. However, shifts to increased dispersal may occur when temporal heterogeneity is the primary selective force and constant quota harvest occurs outside reserves. In addition, model results suggest the potential for changes in the genetic variability in dispersal after habitat fragmentation. The predicted evolutionary changes in dispersal will depend on factors such as the relative genetic and environmental contributions to dispersal- related traits and the extent of anthropogenic impacts outside reserves.

Functional relationships for recruitment and predation mortality were developed by multiple regression analyses. The resultant model output compares well with observed data from the fishery. The model was then applied to simulate stock development over a 50 year time period using different management policies and a variety of environmental conditions. The investigated management policies reduce fishing mortality and range from a moratorium on the Eastern Baltic cod fishery via the establishment of a permanent or a seasonal marine reserve in ICES subdivision 25 to a fishing as usual scenario. The environmental conditions incorporated were based on the size of the reproductive volume (RV) and comprise a best case and a worst case of reproductive conditions, and two more realistic scenarios, where we assumed that a historic series of RV-sizes reoccurs over the simulation period. Our results show a strong dependence of stock dynamics on the environmental conditions. Under prevailing low RV, our model projects stock extinction by the year 2020, if fishing continues as usual. Under the restrictive scenarios, where fishing mortality is reduced either directly or by implementation of a marine reserve, the stock benefits from an increase in stock size and an improved age structure. A seasonal closure of subdivision (SD) 25 as opposed to a closure of the entire Baltic Sea appears to be sufficient to prevent the Eastern Baltic cod stock from failing below safe biological limits.

Increased fish grazing, primarily driven by reduced fishing, was strongly negatively correlated with macroalgal cover and resulted in a 2-fold increase in the density of coral recruits within a Bahamian reef system. Our conclusions are robust because four alternative hypotheses that may generate a spurious correlation between grazing and coral recruitment were tested and rejected. Grazing appears to influence the density and community structure of coral recruits, but no detectable influence was found on the overall size-frequency distribution, community structure, or cover of corals. We interpret this absence of pattern in the adult coral community as symptomatic of the impact of a recent disturbance event that masks the recovery trajectories of individual reefs.

We characterized patterns of passive dispersal in the eastern basin of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington, and interpreted the results in the context of marine reserve network connectivity. We used a surface current model to describe the dispersal of passive particles released from 16 sites over periods of 4 and 30 d in the spring of three consecutive years. We then used this approximation to infer the extent to which existing marine reserves and protected areas established on an ad hoe basis are likely to function as a network connected via larval exchange. Dispersal patterns varied substantially between release sites. Release site location accounted for the greatest amount of variation in dispersal distance, exceeding variation due to year, month, or tidal phase. After 30 d, dispersal distance and variance combined to describe three groups of release sites: those characterized by short distance, low variance dispersal; those characterized by long distance, low variance dispersal; and those characterized by intermediate to long distance, high variance dispersal. We suggest that sites within this third group are likely to make the strongest contributions to network connectivity in this system. Our findings underscore the importance of using both dispersal distance and variance estimates to model connectivity between sites and suggest that the performance of ad hoe collections of protected sites can be enhanced through the establishment of additional protected sites chosen to fill critical gaps in existing networks.",18,2007,10.1007/BF02700164,WOS:000247075600001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

Here we suggest that dispersal and gene flow in marine fish populations (a primary biological consideration for marine reserve design) increases with latitude. For example, north temperate fish species at latitudes between 40 degrees and 45 degrees had about three times greater dispersal potential (planktonic larval duration (PLD), n = 96 species) and genetic homogeneity (F-ST, n = 100 species) than fish species near equatorial regions. Using the PLD and FST relationships, dispersal increases at a rate of similar to 8% per degree of latitude north or south of the equator. Therefore tropical MPAs should not serve as direct scalar templates in other regions, but rather should be used as a basis against which higher-latitude MPAs should be scaled. However, a review of 429 existing MPAs indicates that no such changes in reserve size have been implemented with respect to latitude. Fisheries managers must be prepared and willing to implement MPAs at large scales in high latitudes, either as single reserves or in a network, or else we lose the legitimacy of a new and promising management tool for conserving marine biodiversity in cold ocean regions.",42,2006,10.1139/F06-151,WOS:000243945200001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

CPUE showed a significant non-linear decline with distance from the centre of the reserve, with a depression at the boundary followed by a plateau. This depression was caused by local depletion associated with concentration of fishing effort at the reserve boundary, while the plateau suggests that lobster export from the reserve is sufficient to maintain stable catch rates Lip to 1500 in from the boundary. Commercial catch and effort data were combined to estimate CPUA, which declined linearly with distance from the reserve.

Although evidence for spillover has increased recently, mechanisms inducing movement of adult fish from reserve to fished areas are poorly understood. While density-dependent export is a reasonable expectation, given that density of fish targeted by fisheries should increase over time inside well-protected no-take reserves, no study to date has demonstrated development of the process. This study provides evidence consistent with density-dependent export of a planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from a small no-take reserve (protected for 20 years) at Apo Island, Philippines. Mean density of N. vlamingii increased threefold inside the reserve between 1983 and 2003. Density approached an asymptote inside the reserve after 15-20 years of protection. Modal size in the reserve increased from 35 to 45 cm total length (TL) over 20 years of protection. In addition, both density and modal size increased outside the reserve close to (200-300 m), but not farther from (300-500 m), the reserve boundary over the 20years of reserve protection. Movement of adult N. vlamingii across the boundaries of the reserve was rare. Aggressive interactions among adult N. vlamingii were significantly higher (by 3.7 times) inside than outside the reserve. This suggests that density-dependent interactions were more intense inside the reserve. When interacting adults differed in size, the larger individual usually chased away the smaller one. Furthermore, the mean size of adult fish captured by experimental fishing decreased from 35-cm TL 50100 in outside the boundary, to 32-cm TL 250-300 in outside the boundary.

However, the relative value of reserves to particular species is strongly dependent on its life history and behavior. We present a general conceptual framework for considering dispersal in simple demographic models. This framework includes transition matrices that consist of two age-structured models connected by transition probabilities for general migration, ontogenetic shifts, and recruitment in both a reserve and an unprotected area. We show that life history characteristics and perturbation analysis can be used to predict changes in growth rate due to a decrease in adult mortality resulting from a marine reserve for different levels and types of dispersal. Reserves enhanced growth rate for all species irrespective of net dispersal between the reserve and surrounding matrix habitat, but the efficacy of reserves relative to catch reduction depended significantly on the magnitude and sign of net dispersal across the reserve boundary. Patterns of reserve efficacy across different dispersal types were strongly species specific.

Here we have investigated for 2.5 y three populations of the branching coral Stylophora pistillata (3605 colonies) in a locality within the enclosed area (site NR) and in two areas open to the public, by tossing random quadrats at the shallow lagoonar zone (0.5-1.5 m depth). In the two open sites we found significantly higher levels of colony breakage (14-34% vs. 4-9% in the enclosed site), lower partial mortality levels of colonies (in the first 1.5 y; 7-9% vs. 23-30% at NR), higher recruitment (up to 3.0 vs. up to 0.9 colonies/m 2), 50% reduction in coral life span (10 vs. 20 y) and an estimated extinction period of 9-10 y for new cohorts as compared to >20 y in the enclosed site. Average colony size and maximal colony size were about half in the open sites. Live coverage fluctuated widely in all sites but was 3 times higher in the enclosed area (1.0-3.0% vs. 0.3-1.1%). Log-transformed size frequency distributions revealed, at the open sites, a shift from small towards medium-size classes and at the enclosed site, a shift from larger to medium size classes.

This study details the dynamics of a population of great scallops Pecten maximus (L.), within a closed area and an adjacent fished area off the Isle of Man, over a 14 yr period (1989 to 2003). Scallop densities were very low in both areas when the closed area was set up, but increased at an accelerated rate over time within the closed area. Scallop densities also increased on the adjacent fishing ground, but not to the same extent. Consequently, the density of scallops above the minimum legal landing size (110 mm SL) was more than 7 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003. There was also a shift towards much older and larger scallops in the closed area and, correspondingly, lower estimates of total mortality. Experimental dredging of 2 plots within the closed area confirmed that fishing drove these differences in population dynamics and structure. These patterns of scallop density, age and size structure resulted in the exploitable biomass (adductor muscle and gonad) of scallops being nearly 11 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003, and the reproductive biomass was 12.5 times higher. This is significant for fisheries management because the build up of high densities of large P. maximus individuals enhanced local reproductive potential and therefore the likelihood of export of larvae to the surrounding fishing grounds. Along with these direct benefits of closed area protection, juvenile scallops had higher survival and individual growth rates in the closed area, apparently in response to reduced fishing disturbance. Although juvenile scallops are not subject to direct removal by fishing, protection during this critical phase therefore appeared to assist the recovery of the closed area population. In summary, this study joins a growing number indicating that the use of closed areas offers a range of benefits over more traditional methods of managing fisheries. Fisheries for relatively sedentary and long-lived species such as P. maximus appear to be particularly suitable for this type of management.",66,2005,10.3354/meps298189,WOS:000231905600017,field,CI,2001-2003,PPA,Bradda Inshore closed area,14,,1989, gear restriction area,2,NA,,NA,mix,temperate,Europe,Irish sea,other,invertebrate,pecten maximus,fished,no,.,.,.,connectivity,.,reproductive potential,mean reproductive biomass,table 4,positive,yes,g per scallop,NA,174.945,2,NA,48.93886033,20.2,2,NA,4.907321061,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,VARIANCE NOT AVAILABLE MAIL SENT TO AUTHORS

Though few marine species are regarded as being extinct due to Man, many species are critically endangered (e.g. the monk seal Monachus monachus), endangered (e.g. the Mediterranean giant limpet Patella ferruginea) or vulnerable, i.e. dwindling rapidly, although not threatened with extinction in the immediate future (e.g. the large mollusk Pinna nobilis). There are also threats to ecosystems (ecodiversity), such as, in the Mediterranean, the Lithophyllum byssoides rim and the seagrass Posidonia oceanica meadow. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were initially established to protect biodiversity via the removal of human exploitation and occupation. However, since the 1970s, the notion of MPA has moved on to a more general concept of nature conservation, then to a more dynamic one of nature management, within the framework of sustainable development. Today, the aims of MPAs are therefore sixfold: nature conservation, public education, reference areas for scientific research, tourism, export of fish eggs, larvae and adults to adjacent areas and finally management of the various uses of the sea (e.g. commercial fishing, recreational fishing, pleasure boating and tourism) in such a way that they do not conflict with each other or with conservation aims. Mediterranean MPAs, especially the Port-Cros National Park, illustrate the fact that they are rather characterized by the management of human activities than by a set of prohibitions and that there is no negative interaction between biodiversity conservation and artisanal fishing (i.e. small-scale commercial fishing), at least in the way it is done (i.e. with additional constraints to general regulations: mesh size, prohibition of trawling and long-lining, etc.). Consequently, MPAs are generally of benefit to the economy (e.g. commercial fishing and tourism industry), not only within MPAs but also in adjacent areas. They therefore constitute a powerful tool for integrated coastal management.",24,2005,.,WOS:000233133900002,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

We have developed a spatially-structured simulation model of the population dynamics and harvest by line fishing of common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardis) on the Great Barrier Reef, in order to evaluate potential management strategies, including marine reserves.The simulation model incorporates harvest by multiple sectors (commercial, charter and recreational) and a spatially structured sub-model of the full life-history of common coral trout, including larval dispersal and hence the possibility of a larval subsidy effect. In this paper, we use this tool, the Effects of Line Fishing Simulator (ELFSim), to evaluate the conditions, extent and potential effects on the fishery that a larval subsidy effect might impart. Simulations were performed for different levels of larval settlement on the same reef to which they were spawned, for a range of spatial closures.Results showed that under a constant effort scenario, as the amount of area closed to fishing increased, catch tended to decrease as the effort concentrated on a smaller proportion of the population. The spawning biomass increased however, as a larger proportion of the population was protected. The catch supported per unit of biomass was higher when there were area closures and when larvae were advected to reefs after being spawned. This occurred because the areas closed to fishing had biomass at near pre-exploitation levels, and thus subsidised the areas open to fishing with larval input.When larvae were advected among reefs, closing small portions of habitat to fishing also enhanced catches over what would have been obtained had no areas been closed to fishing.",0,2005,.,WOS:000290114102088,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Model results indicated that for lingcod stocks with low abundance, marine reserves could improve egg production while having a small effect on fishery yield. For more abundant stocks, if a portion of the stock is protected in reserves, fishing rates could be increased outside reserves without reducing egg production relative to egg production levels in the absence of reserves.",40,2004,10.1139/F04-054,WOS:000224451000004,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

The tagged fish were from seven species: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus); black drum (Pogonias cromis); sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus); common snook (Centropomus undecimalis); spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus); bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas); and crevalle jack (Caranx hippos). A total of 403 tagged fish were recaptured during the study period, including 65 individuals that emigrated from the NTZ and 16 individuals that immigrated into the NTZ from surrounding waters of the lagoon. Migration distances between the original tagging location and the sites where emigrating fish were recaptured were from 0 to 150 km, and these migration distances appeared to be influenced by the proximity of the NTZ to spawning areas or other habitats that are important to specific life-history stages of individual species. Fish that immigrated into the NTZ moved distances ranging from approximately 10 to 75 km. Recapture rates for sportfish species that migrated across the NTZ boundary suggested that more individuals may move into the protected habitats than move out. These data demonstrated that although this estuarine no-take reserve can protect species from fishing, it may also serve to extract exploitable individuals from surrounding fisheries; therefore, if the no-take reserve does function to replenish surrounding fisheries, then increased egg production and larval export may be more important mechanisms of replenishment than the spillover of excess adults from the reserve into fishable areas.",29,2004,.,WOS:000223030100012,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

Local fishery benefits from spillover will likely generate support from fishing communities for marine reserves. We used underwater visual census to show that biomass of Acanthuridae (surgeonfish) and Carangidae (jacks), two families of reef fish that account for 40-75% of the fishery yield from Apo Island, Philippines, tripled in a well-protected no-take reserve over 18 years (1983-2001). Biomass of these families did not change significantly over the same period at a site open to fishing. The reserve protected 10% of the total reef fishing area at the island. Outside the reserve, biomass of these families increased significantly closer to (200-250 m) than farther away from (250-500 m) the reserve boundary over time.

Evidence from northern Australia,.,.,"Monitoring the effectiveness of marine protected areas requires sensitivity to both resource conservation and public awareness. Nondestructive sampling methods are preferred, but potential insights into fishery management benefits may be limited. The toolbox of fisheries science contains established length-based methods that can potentially be used to extend assessment analyses. In northeastern Australia, state regulations allow commercial gill nets to be set within most regional estuaries, primarily targeting barramundi Lates calcarifer (Centropomidae; also known as barramundi perch). The state closed several riverine estuaries throughout this region to commercial fishing in the early 1980s. To monitor the effect of these closures on barramundi (and other) populations, our research teams deployed gill nets (mesh sizes 19-152 mm) bimonthly over 2 years within three pairs of systems (one closed and one neighboring estuary open to commercial net fishing per pair). On an hourly basis during each net set (1500-2100 hours), all fish were removed and measured. Of 1,657 barramundi netted, 96% were returned to the water alive. Catch averaged 2.8 times greater, and biomass 3.5 times greater, in closed systems compared to open (P<0.02). Barramundi catch in closed systems exceeded that in open systems for each 30-mm length-class, including all classes below the legal limit of 580 mm. Barramundi are well-studied, protandrous hermaphrodites occurring in spatially discrete stocks in tropical mangrove estuaries. Applying published parameter values in a length-based analysis revealed that estimated egg-production was 21 times greater in the closed systems (P<0.03). In fact, egg,production in commercially fished estuaries was estimated to be near zero. The single most important factor in sustaining the commercial barramundi fishery in this region may be the function of interspersed estuarine reserves in providing sources of spillover and recruitment to neighboring open systems. Given current regulations, a network of protected estuaries may be especially beneficial, if not essential, for maintaining a sustainable fishery along this coast.",5,2004,.,WOS:000223814600020,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,"pdf requested; PDF NOT FOUND EITHER IN RESEARCH GATE, WOS, SCHOLAR AND SCIHUB NOT ACCESSIBLE"

Predicted benefits include increased fish biomass, increased species diversity, and enhanced recruitment to the MPA itself, as well as to proximal areas. Whereas MPAs have in fact been shown to increase biomass and species diversity, evidence of enhanced recruitment has yet to be seen. If MPAs are significantly enhancing recruitment, one would expect to see the recruitment dominated by groups of siblings arising from highly productive females predicted to eventually reside in MPAs due to the protection afforded them. If occurring, such sibling-dominated recruitment could be identified by significantly fewer mtDNA haplotypes and significantly fewer singleton haplotypes in population samples of recruiting juveniles compared to adult populations. We investigated a new approach for potentially determining whether MPAs might be significantly enhancing recruitment to proximal areas of Santa Cruz and the Santa Catalina islands in the California Channel Islands, by seeking evidence of sibling-dominated juvenile recruitment in mitochondrial DNA haplotype data of the kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus.

Export of reproductive products can increase recruitment in open areas, while movement of harvestable-sized animals provides benefits in the form of spillover from the refuge, resulting in elevated catch rates near closed area boundaries. Here, we evaluate potential spillover effects from four large marine protected areas in temperate New England waters, closed beginning in 1994. True spillover, as differentiated from seasonal, ontogenetic, or environmentally driven movements, requires differential densities within and adjacent to the closed areas. Density-related spillover, thus, is typified by a biomass or abundance gradient beginning at the boundary and declining as a function of increasing distance. Moderate rates of dispersion are required to establish the density gradient, which may be enhanced by differential distribution of fishing intensity. We tested for density gradients as a function of distance from the closed areas using otter trawl tow-by-tow data collected by scientific observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. Data were adjusted for tow duration (e.g., kg/h towed). A total of 51 species-area combinations were evaluated for the presence of density gradients consistent with implied spillover effects. Of this total, five species-area combinations exhibited statistically significant declines in catch rates with distance. These significant combinations were generally consistent with research vessel surveying information showing year-round catches higher inside the closed area as compared to adjacent open areas after they were closed (e.g., reserve effects). Combined groundfish species catches did not show significant declining trends as functions of distances from the four closed areas, nor did the numbers of species caught per haul. Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus associated with Closed Area I demonstrated the most pronounced apparent spillover, but the pattern of relative fish density at the reserve boundary exhibited a seasonal cycle associated with spawning. We conclude that spillover effects are not a universal consequence of siting marine protected areas in temperate waters but are related to the specifics of the degree of random and directional movements, the fishing intensity field in the adjoining open areas, seasonal migration patterns, and optimal habitat preferences of individual species in relation to the placement of reserve boundaries, all of which may confound the interpretation of spillover.",23,2004,.,WOS:000223814600016,field,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,spillover

Two settlement peaks were observed each year, a main peak in spring-early summer and a second peak in autumn-early winter. Interannual variability in settlement was very high (ca. 1 order of magnitude). Settlement was generally higher on the rock wall than in the seagrass meadow. No appreciable successful recruitment was observed in the meadow during the 4 yr studied despite the arrival of settlers.

However, no differential settlement on the rhizome stratum was observed. In contrast to the seagrass meadow, recruitment occurred every year on the rock wall.

Many benthic marine organisms release propagules that spend time in the water column before settlement. During this period, ocean currents transport or disperse the propagules. When considering the size of a marine reserve and the spacing between reserves, one must consider the distance which propagules disperse. We could find estimates of dispersal distance,for 32 taxa; for 25 of these, we were also able to find data on the time the propagules spent dispersing. Dispersal distance ranged from meters to thousands of kilometers, and time in the plankton ranged from minutes to months. A significant positive correlation was found between the log-transformed duration in the plankton and the log-transformed dispersal distance (r =. 0.7776, r(2) = 0.60, df = 1, 25, P = 0.000); the more time propagules spend in the water column the further they tend to be dispersed. The frequency distribution of the log-transformed dispersal distance is bimodal (kurtosis = -1.29, t = -4.062, P < 0.001) with a gap between 1 and 20 km. Propagules that dispersed <1 km spent less time in the plankton (<100 h), or if they remained in the plankton for a longer period, they tended to remain in the waters near the bottom. Propagules that dispersed >20 km spent more than 300 h in the plankton. The bimodal. nature of the distribution suggests that evolutionary constraints may reduce the likelihood of evolving mid-range dispersal strategies (i.e., dispersal between 1 and 20 km) resulting in two evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies: dispersal <1 km or >similar to20 km. We suggest that reserves be designed large enough to contain the short-distance dispersing propagules and be spaced far enough apart that long-distance dispersing propagules released from one reserve can settle in adjacent reserves. A reserve 4-6 km in diameter should be large enough to contain the larvae of short-distance dispersers, and reserves spaced 1020 km apart should be close enough to capture. propagules released from adjacent reserves.",623,2003,.,WOS:000181742700013,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

In this study, the present status of the Posidonia oceanica meadows in the Cabrera National Park (Mediterranean), the only marine national park in Spain, was assessed, and the effectiveness of the conservation measures adopted was tested. This was done by reconstruction of past and present growth, quantification of the demographic status of the established meadows, and quantification of patch formation and growth rates in areas where recolonization is occurring. The meadows extended from 1-43 in deep at Santa Maria bay and from 1-33 m at Es Port. Leaf production rate of the stands examined ranged between 6.5 and 7.8 leaves shoot(-1) yr(-1), with higher rates in Santa Maria than in Es Port.

A logistic rate model was used to predict equilibrium Population sizes in a marine harvest refuge, based oil species-specific dispersal dynamics and the spatial configuration of the refuge. The model parameters were derived for Caribbean spiny lobsters and queen conch in all isolated marine reserve at Glover's Reef, Belize, and were compared to observed population change over a 5-yr period. Spiny lobsters and queen conch, the two most heavily exploited species in the Caribbean, differ in larval recruitment rates (immigration) and mobility of adults (emigration). The expected increase in the population size of spiny lobsters in this refuge was 250%, and queen conch was 420%, over that of the initial fished population. The observed densities of lobsters and conch in the refuge approached the predicted estimates within three years. To further explore the impact of alternative spatial configurations on refuge populations, the model was run on the same populations in two hypothetical refuges. In a refuge of the same area but 50% less absorbing boundary (adjacent to intensively fished areas), the spiny lobster population was expected to be 30%, larger than the equilibrium population size in the original refuge. whereas the queen conch population was not expected to change from that in the original refuge. In a refuge that was 50% larger and with 50% less absorbing boundary. the spiny lobster population was expected to increase 110% and the queen conch population was expected to increase 50% over the equilibrium population size in the original refuge. Relatively minor changes in refuge area and boundary conditions may thus result in major population-level responses by exploited species, depending oil dispersal dynamics and habitat availability.

All fish were immersed in oxytetracycline (OTC) prior to release to produce an identifiable, chemical mark on the otoliths. The release area was typical of primary nursery habitat in this region. For four years post-stocking, fish were collected throughout the sound using hook and line, spear, and trammel net. Otoliths were examined for OTC marks to determine which fish were of hatchery origin. It was found that while dispersal was substantial, many stocked fish stayed in the general area of release (1.8 x 3.2 km) until reaching the age of maturity (similar toage 3) when they left the estuary, and at all ages they were mixed with wild fish. This suggests that relatively small areas containing the appropriate suite of habitat types could be designated as marine reserves (no-take zones) in order to increase escapement of red drum, thus enhancing recruitment to the spawning stock. Establishing a system of these very small reserves in a number of estuaries would minimize interference with anglers while assisting recovery of red drum stocks, and perhaps enhancing stocks of other estuarine species as well.",15,2002,10.1577/1548-8446(2002)027<0020:SMRMIE>2.0.CO;2,WOS:000175023500010,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

A model was developed to investigate the effect of the New Zealand commercial eel fishery on escapement of migrating longfin (Anguilla dieffenbachii) and shortfin (A. australis) eels. Exploitation rates of 5% and 10% per year reduced the spawning per recruit of A. dieffenbachii females by 83% and 96.5%, respectively, below unexploited levels.

An alternative hypothesis is that wide dispersal may be an incidental byproduct of an ontogenetic migration from and then back to the parental habitat. Under this hypothesis, the water column is a better habitat than the bottom for early development. Because the parental area is often an especially favorable habitat for juveniles and adults, selection may even favor larval retention or larval return rather than dispersal. Where larval capabilities and currents permit, a high percentage of recruits may then be produced from local adults. Expected consequences of a high proportion of local recruitment are stronger links between stock and recruitment, greater vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and local modifications of habitat, greater local benefits from fishery reserves, and possibly more localized adaptation within populations. Export of some larvae is consistent with a high proportion of retained or returning larvae, could stabilize populations linked by larval exchange, and provide connectivity between marine reserves. Even a small amount of larval export could account for the greater gene flow, large ranges, and long evolutionary durations seen in species with long pelagic larval stages.",190,2002,.,WOS:000176377500007,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

Most (58.7%) tagged lobsters were recaptured in the immediate vicinity of their original capture location. Among lobsters that moved, 77.1% traveled less than 1000 m. Lobster movement resulted in some exchange between no-take reserves and nearby harvested areas (8.7% of lobsters recaptured were in an area different from their location of tagging). Overall, little evidence was found for a relationship between lobster movement and sex, size, or time at large. Annual harvesting mortality accounted for up to 71.9% for lobsters eligible for harvest. However, many more lobsters tagged outside of no-take reserves were harvested (11.5-71.9%) than those tagged in no-take reserves (0.0-18.5%), a result of low frequency of movement between these areas. No difference was found between female and male mortality as a result of the fishery.

Fishing mortality was estimated to be 47-98% lower at the reserve. Using a circulation model, we theoretically assessed effectiveness of ECLSP and nominal reserves at the exploited sites in augmenting recruitment through redistribution of larvae to all sites. Larvae discharged from ECLSP and EI recruited throughout Exuma Sound, whereas those from LSI and CI recruited only to CI and LSI. Hence, only reserves at EI and ECLSP would be suitable for metapopulation recruitment.

We measured catches before and after the park's establishment and during the management changes and compared these catches with the unmanaged side of the park. Additionally, we placed baited traps on both sides of the park over a full tidal cycle which allowed us to measure the spillover from the park compared to the deeper, rougher, and less fished reef edge. The total wet mass of catches per trap, the mean size of the trapped fish, and the number of fish species caught per trap declined as a function of the distance away from the park edge on both the southern and northern sides. However, this relationship was truncated on the unmanaged side which also had smaller catches, smaller fish, and fewer species than the managed side. Trap fishers on the managed side adapted to the spillover by increasing the traps per fisher, which had the effect of reducing the catch per trap. Tides and reef morphology also appeared to interact and influenced catches, but we found no relationships between catches and benthic substratum cover, which was usually dominated by seagrass and sand. Spillover from the deeper reef edge was evident for the managed but not the unmanaged side of the park, but may be due to differences in reef morphology interacting with tidal patterns rather than management. On the managed side, the park significantly increased the catch per fisher and catch per area by >50%, but even after the park's size was reduced, the total catch was reduced by similar to 30%. The reduced park was still similar to 50% of the total area. Consequently, the catch per area increase was insufficient to compensate for the lost area over this early period of the park's establishment. Spillover was greatest for the dominant fisheries species. These were moderately vagile species in the rabbitfish (Siganidae; herbivores), emperors (Lethrinidae; carnivores), and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae; herbivores) families, which had instantaneous emigration rates from the park to the reserve fishing ground of similar to0.5. Our field survey, combined with previous modeling studies, based on adult emigration rates from marine reserves, suggests that tropical fisheries dominated by rabbitfish, emperors, and surgeonfish should be enhanced by closed areas of similar to 10-15% of the total area.

Spillover of organisms from marine reserves may augment adjacent areas, and is often cited as an important reason for the establishment of marine protected areas. Spillover is dependent on residence or limited dispersal of organisms resulting in an increase in their abundance and size within a marine reserve.2. To investigate movement (i.e. spillover versus residence) we tagged and released 90 blue cod Parapercis colias (Pinguipedidae) at each of four sites, two in and two adjacent to Long Island-Kokomohua Marine Reserve, Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. The study was done 4-5 years after establishment of the no-rake reserve.3. Abundances of blue cod were similar in and out of the marine reserve, but mean estimated size was 4 cm larger in the reserve than at fished sites.4. Fewer tag resights were made in the reserve than at fished sites, and lagged blue cod were resighted at greater depths in the reserve than at fished sites.5. Most resights (75% for fished sites, 73% for reserve sites) were made within 100 m of the tagging sites, and the number of resights declined through time, though tagged individuals were resighted up to 31 months after tagging.6. The lower number of tag resights at reserve sites, despite the lack of extraction, is consistent with some blue cod at reserve sites moving longer distances than those at fished sites.7. The greater size of individuals in the reserve and limited dispersal of a proportion of the population show that survivorship of blue cod is increased within marine reserves.8. Computer simulations based on measured dispersals indicate that even marine reserves of a few hundred metres long-shore extent have the potential to supplement fished populations nearby.9. These data provide direct evidence of limited dispersal of the most common edible reef fish in the Marlborough Sounds. Blue cod will grow to larger sizes in marine reserves and via spillover will become available to fishers in adjacent areas of contiguous coast.

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-anatysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The present work reviews concepts and field evidence for enhancement of recruitment of species in MPAs, focusing geographically on the Mediterranean littoral because of its long history of intensive fishery exploitation, but drawing on evidence from studies on recruitment processes in general on MPAs both in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. We considered recruitment as the process of a fish being added to the local population. The general questions of interest are whether the increase in biomass of species protected in MPAs has an effect on recruitment in the MPAs or in neighbouring areas, and, on competition and predation effects on new recruits. A flow diagram of the effects of MPA status on recruitment is developed and employed to identify the relevant processes. The diagram incorporates three levels of factors: (1) characteristics of MPAs (location, size, habitat type, oceanography and level of protection); (2) life stages of species protected in MPAs relevant to recruitment (eggs, larvae, settlers and juveniles); and (3) fundamental processes of dispersal/movement, predation and competition. From this conceptual diagram, the following main components of the recruitment process were identified and used to structure the review: (1) relationship between the ecology of pelagic stages and the design, location and oceanographic regime of MPAs; (2) effects of protection in MPAs from fishery exploitation of nursery habitats on settlement success; and (3) effects of protection on survival of settlers and juveniles from competition and predation. We found an exceptionally low number of studies specifically addressing recruitment processes in MPAs. This was particularly the case in in hat concerns the relationship between larval ecology and the characteristics and oceanographic regime of MPAs. The effectiveness of MPAs in promoting recruitment mainly depends on the locations and on sizes of the MPAs in relation to the reproductive biology and larval ecology of the species concerned. The locations and sizes of MPAs in turn depend on MPA objectives, whether the purpose is to protect entire life cycles, the juveniles, or to increase egg production and larval export. The assessment of the relationship between the protection of nursery habitats and settlement success indicates that the magnitude of the effects of protection depends on whether the recruitment of the species involved is restricted to a narrowly-defined set of environmental conditions or, on the contrary, can occur in diverse environments, including areas beyond the influence of the MPAs. Thus, the locations of MPAs determine the habitats which are protected and, consequently, the species, the settlement of which will be favoured. For Mediterranean shallow-water species, the nearshore zone encompasses most of the essential nursery habitats for protection. Recruitment studies conducted in MPAs in the north-western Mediterranean have showed no differences in survival of newly-settled littoral fish between MPAs and the areas outside of them. Conversely, for older recruits, mortality was found to be higher inside MPAs, probably due to the increased abundance and size of large predators. This study highlights the almost total absence of studies addressing even the most elementary. questions of recruitment in the specific context of MPAs.",73,2000,10.1017/S0376892900000175,WOS:000089515000006,review,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,mix,.,.,.,connectivity,.,recruitment,recruitment,NA,ambiguous,no,NA,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,"very good review, to use for redaction; info on why recruitment may not be enhanced in MPAs (increased predation)"
385,in,out,out,WoS,yes,J,"Jennings, S","Jennings, S",Patterns and prediction of population recovery in marine reserves,.,.,"Marine reserves (no-take zones) are widely recommended as conservation and fishery management tools. One potential benefit of marine reserves is that they can reduce fishing mortality. This can lead to increases in the abundance of spawners, providing insurance against recruitment failure and maintaining or enhancing yields in fished areas. This paper considers the factors that influence recovery following marine reserve protection, describes patterns of recovery in numbers and biomass, and suggests how recovery rates can be predicted. Population recovery is determined by initial population size, the intrinsic rate of population increase r, and the degree of compensation (increases in recruits per spawner as spawner abundance falls) or depensation (lower than expected recruitment at low abundance, Allee effect) in the spawner-recruit relationship. Within a reserve, theoretical recovery rates are further modified by metapopulation structure and the success of individual recruitment events. Recovery also depends on the extent of reductions in fishing mortality (F) as determined by the relationship between patterns of movement, migration, and density-dependent habitat use (buffer effect) in relation to the size, shape and location of the reserve. The effects of reductions in F on population abundance have been calculated using a variety of models that incorporate transfer rates between the reserve and fished areas, fishing mortality outside the reserve and life history parameters of the population. These models give useful indications of increases in production and biomass (as yield per recruit and spawners per recruit respectively) due to protection, but do not address recruitment. Many reserves are very small in relation to the geographical range of fish or invertebrate populations. In these reserves it may be impossible to distinguish recovery due to population growth from that due to redistribution. Mean rates of recovery can be predicted from r, but the methods are data intensive. This is ironic when marine reserves are often favoured for management or conservation in data-poor situations where conventional stock assessment is impossible. In these data-poor situations, it may be possible to predict recovery rates from very low population sizes by using maximum body size or age at maturity as simple correlates of the intrinsic rate of natural increase.",163,2000,10.1023/A:1016619102955,WOS:000168058800004,model,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,no control

These models predicted that a marine reserve would result in a decrease in fishery yield, an increase in spawning biomass and that movements of fish across the reserve boundaries could reduce its benefits. We utilised an age-structured model based on an Atlantic cod population that included more realistic reproductive factors. We compared a Reserve regime that contained a reserve with a No-reserve regime in which the usual fishery management tools were used. As exploitation rate increased, the relative recruitment and spawners biomass decreased in the No-reserve regime. Larger reserves resulted in more robust recruitment and biomass of spawners. At low exploitation rates, marine reserves resulted in smaller yields. However, when the exploitation rate was larger than the rate which gives the maximum sustainable yield, the biomass of female spawners was maintained at a higher level in the Reserve regime and hence the yield did not collapse. Faster rate of movement of fish decreased these advantages, but the higher spawners biomass and level of recruitment still provided advantages for the Reserve regime. Moreover, even for highly mobile fish, our model suggests that a fish stock protected with a marine reserve would be more resilient to exploitation than when managed without. However, a model realistic spatially and temporally would be necessary to assess the usefulness of marine reserves to prevent overexploitation of migrating fish. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

With a heightened awareness of the economic, ecological and aesthetic importance of reefs highlighted by the International Year of the Reef campaign, progress is being made toward the development of sustainable coral reef ecosystems. The emphasis has been in research and monitoring to detect changes and identify factors contributing to the decline, increased public education and awareness, and the establishment of marine protected areas. Attempts to reverse the present trend of reef decline have focused almost exclusively on reducing the damage from boat anchors through the establishment of mooring buoys, and the restoration of reefs following ship groundings. Remedial action for ship groundings seeks to accelerate natural recovery of damaged areas, through righting and reattachment of broken corals, removal of reef rubble and stabilization of unconsolidated reef material, and reinforcement of the reef structure. Coral losses associated with hurricanes, disease outbreaks and chronic pollution and sedimentation are of greater significance and pose greater challenges for restoration. These impacts may encompass entire reef tracts, affecting large numbers of corals, including the largest corals, which may be several hundred years old and which provide a major source of new coral recruits. Degraded coral reefs exhibit natural recovery only once the source of insult is eliminated, however this process may require several decades. Natural recovery can be enhanced by eliminating disease from affected corals, by transplanting living coral fragments into degraded areas, and by offering artificial substrates as a framework for natural colonization. Transplantation of adult corals from distant reefs is labor and cost intensive, and may cause significant damage to the source reef; in addition, there is the potential to introduce new diseases to the rehabilitated area. Viable alternatives include the use of juvenile and cultured corals. Juvenile corals are especially promising, as they require no specialized rearing equipment, they can be removed in large numbers at a lower cost and with little impact to the source reef, and they retain a high genetic variability. Researchers are experimenting with potential artificial substrates which can be used to attach juvenile corals to stimulate natural colonization Coral larvae recognize specific chemical signals that induce settlement from the plankton and metamorphosis to the adult form. Flypaper containing these signal molecules has been developed and tested as a potential means of reseeding degraded reefs. Another alternative involves attaching juvenile corals to a limestone material precipitated in situ through electrolysis, utilizing the chemical signals released by the juveniles to promote additional colonization. Continuing research, building on a growing knowledge of coral biology and hypothesis-driven field experiments, holds the promise of developing practical applications in coral reef ecosystem management and rehabilitation that will help ensure the sustainability of these priceless resources.",0,1998,.,WOS:000084418300111,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,not relevant

However, very little empirical evidence exists on the rates and patterns of increase of density and biomass of target species following the closure of a coral reef or part of a reef, nor on how quickly any gains potentially useful to fisheries can be lost if reserves are subsequently opened to fishing. This paper presents empirical evidence derived from the visual monitoring of density and biomass of large predatory coral reef fish (Serranidae (Epinephelinae), Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae and Carangidae as a group) in two small marine reserves and at two control sites in the Philippines from 1983 to 1993. At one reserve (Sumilon) a complex history of management allowed seven measurements of density and biomass at durations of reserve protection ranging from -2 (i.e., fished for 2 yr) to 9 yr. At the second reserve (Apo), seven measurements were taken at durations of reserve protection ranging from 1 to 11 yr. Density of large predators provided an excellent indicator of the effects of marine reserve protection and fishing. Density decreased significantly twice when the Sumilon reserve was opened to fishing (1985, 1993), and increased significantly three times following durations of marine reserve protection of 5 yr (Sumilon reserve and nonreserve sites, 1987-1991) and >6 yr (Apo reserve beyond 1988). Density of large predators at the Apo nonreserve site (open to fishing) did not change significantly, remaining low throughout the study. Significant positive linear correlations of mean density of large predators with years of reserve protection were observed at both reserves.

The pattern of increase of mean biomass with years of reserve protection was more curvilinear than that of mean density, particularly at Sumilon, where a slow increase was observed in the first 3-5 yr (reflecting delayed recruitment and a natural delay to the period of maximum individual mass growth), followed by an increasing rate over the next 4 yr.

Evidence from Apo Island, central Philippines",.,.,"A frequent expectation of the use of marine reserves in management of coral reef fisheries is maintenance or enhancement of yields to areas adjacent to reserves by adult (post-settlement) movements from reserve to fished areas (the so-called 'spillover effect'). Demonstration of this effect has been rare. This paper reports on some circumstantial evidence derived from underwater visual census monitoring of densities of large predatory coral reef fish [Serranidae (Epinephelinae), Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae and Carangidae as a group] inside and adjacent to a small marine reserve at Apo Island in the central Philippines over a 10 yr period (1983 to 1993). The marine reserve (sanctuary) at Apo Island was established in 1982 and was protected from fishing for the duration of the study. The non-reserve area was open to fishing by up to 200 municipal fishers using traditional fishing gear (bamboo traps, hooks and lines, gill nets and spears). Significant positive correlations of both mean density and species richness of large predatory fish with duration of reserve protection (from 1 to 11 yr) were observed in both the reserve and non-reserve areas surveyed. The minimum distance from the boundary of the reserve to the non-reserve area surveyed was 200 m. During the first 8 yr of reserve protection combined, the density of large predatory fish at distances 200 to 300, 300 to 400 and 400 to 500 m from the reserve boundary did not differ significantly from an even distribution (chi-squared test, p > 0.05). During the period of 9 to 11 yr of protection combined, there was a significantly higher density of these fish in the area closest to the reserve (i.e. in the 200 to 300 m area, chi-squared test, p < 0.05). This visual census data is consistent with a proposed model of adult fish export from the reserve to the non-reserve areas. Along with interview data collected in 1986 and 1992 that showed that fishers were unanimous that their yields had increased since the reserve was implemented, this study provides evidence for export of adult fish from reserve to fished areas.",272,1996,10.3354/meps132001,WOS:A1996UD22300001,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,.,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,,too indirect measures of connectivity

Recruitment was spatially variable both within and between locations, and there was seasonal and inter-annual variability in recruitment success at 1 site. Recruitment of hard corals was dominated by planulating species, consistent with predictions made from coral recruitment patterns at Lord Howe Island, and in contrast with most previous studies of Pacific reefs. At the 2 most offshore islands, coral cover was dominated by Acropora sp., but the density of acroporid recruits was extremely low, suggesting that this taxon may be reliant on sporadic recruitment from northern sites. In contrast with tropical sites where coral recruitment in shallow water is most frequent on downward facing surfaces or crevices, corals settled abundantly on the upper-most surface of settlement plates at most sites. The difference in settlement orientation is possibly because of: (1) reduced light at high latitudes; (2) a reduction in herbivore abundance at high latitudes; (3) competition for settlement space on lower surfaces with abundant temperate species such as bryozoans and barnacles.",68,1995,10.3354/meps123155,WOS:A1995RQ34100016,.,.,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,not relevant

The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option.

We investigate a metapopulation model to see how marine reserves might help to conserve such populations and benefit fisheries. The model defines two kinds of patches: (i) those open to fishing and (ii) those maintained as reserves free from exploitation. Each patch may occur in one of two states according to whether or not it contains fishes recruited to the fishery. It is shown that reserves become highly beneficial as the local extinction rate caused by fishing becomes large because they provide a source of recruitment into fished-out patches. In such circumstances, the introduction of reserves meets the needs both of conservation and of sustainable exploitation of the fishery.The abundance of the exploitable population is maximized when half of all patches (reserves + exploited patches) are occupied by the stock. The sustainable yield is also maximized when half of all patches are occupied, assuming that yield is proportional to the local extinction rate. This result could provide a rule of thumb for fishery managers addressing the specific question of enhancing recruitment in heavily deleted stocks of certain reef fisheries.

Six models were developed to test the hypotheses that (1) galjoen are polymorphic with respect to dispersal behaviour, (2) nonreporting of tags masks a random dispersal process, and (3) the recovery distribution is the result of unequal movement rates in different areas. It is inferred from the likelihoods of the various models that the tagged population was polymorphic, with fish displaying either resident or nomadic behaviour.

The potential fecundity (the stock of vitellogenic oocytes in the pre-spawning ovary), egg size (diameter and dry weight of artificially fertilized 1-day-old eggs) and gonad dry weight were assessed for fish sampled in SD 25 and SD 28. Multiple regression analysis identified somatic weight, or total length in combination with Fulton's condition factor, as main predictors of fecundity and gonad dry weight with stage of maturity (oocyte packing density or leading cohort) as an additional predictor. For egg size, somatic weight was identified as main predictor while otolith weight (proxy for age) was an additional predictor. Univariate analysis using GLM revealed significantly higher fecundity and gonad dry weight for turbot from SD 28 (3378-3474 oocytes/g somatic weight) compared to those from SD 25 (2343 oocytes/g somatic weight), with no difference in egg size (1.05 +/- 0.03 mm diameter and 46.8 +/- 6.5 mu g dry weight; mean +/- sd). The difference in egg production matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. This supports the hypothesis of higher size-specific fecundity towards the limit of the distribution of a species as an adaptation to harsher environmental conditions and lower offspring survival probabilities. Within SD 28 comparisons were made between two major fishing areas targeting spawning aggregations and a marine protected area without fishing. The outcome was inconclusive and is discussed with respect to potential fishery induced effects, effects of the salinity gradient, effects of specific year-classes, and effects of maturation status of sampled fish.

Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection.",181,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0040832,WOS:000306548900054,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,same data team as Rossetto 2013 already included in the MA

We found significant differences in parasite fecundity among sites.

Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phe-notypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Cteno-chaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (L-inf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L-50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A(50)) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment. Shifts toward advantageous phenotypes were most common in the oldest and largest MPAs, but occurred in all of the MPAs examined. These results suggest that MPAs may provide protection against the impacts of size-selective harvest on life-history traits in coral-reef fishes.",6,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0193426,WOS:000425831000053,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,unrelevant indicators

In the Belize Barrier Reef, there are several zones with increasing human activity and harvesting of overexploited species. Marine protected areas are designed to protect endangered species and increase the population size of exploited species. The present study investigated the population and morphological characteristics of Lobatus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve (SCMR) at the southernmost tip of the Belize Barrier Reef to estimate the effectiveness of the marine protected area.Results: A total of 693 L. gigas conches were counted over the 7,200 m(2) from 36 transect lines. The densities of juveniles and adult conches in the conservation zone were substantially higher (20.13 and 2.88 individuals/100 m(2), respectively) than in the general use zone (5.29 juveniles and 0.58 adults individuals/100 m(2)). The shell length of adult individuals ranged from 14.4 to 18.5 cm in the conservation zone and from 14.6 to 18.1 cm in the general use zone. A comparison of shell length of juveniles and adults showed no significant differences between the conservation zone (11.39 +/- 1.46 cm) and general use zone (11.62 +/- 1.24 cm). There was a significant positive correlation for shell length with lip thickness in the conservation zone (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.729, p < 0.001) and general use zone (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.613, p = 0.02).Conclusions: The function and effectiveness of marine protected areas are discussed using the results of the present study that identifies the primary objective which is to ensure a continuous recruitment of valuable targeted species by the protection of spawning stock biomass that is important for the management of marine protected areas in an environmentally sensitive ecosystem.",3,2013,10.1186/1810-522X-52-46,WOS:000330219000007,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

As stresses intensify, so do debates about whether reefs will recover after significant damage. True headway in this debate requires documented temporal trajectories for coral assemblages subjected to various combinations of stresses; therefore, we report relevant changes in coral assemblages at Little Cayman Island. Between 1999 and 2012, spatiotemporal patterns in cover, densities of juveniles and size structure of assemblages were documented inside and outside marine protected areas using transects, quadrats and measurements of maximum diameters. Over five years, bleaching and disease caused live cover to decrease from 26% to 14%, with full recovery seven years later. Juvenile densities varied, reaching a maximum in 2010. Both patterns were consistent within and outside protected areas. In addition, dominant coral species persisted within and outside protected areas although their size frequency distributions varied temporally and spatially. The health of the coral assemblage and the similarity of responses across levels of protection suggested that negligible anthropogenic disturbance at the local scale was a key factor underlying the observed resilience.",11,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0075432,WOS:000325810900036,.,.,.,.,Little Cayman,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Cayman Islands,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,recruitment,juveniles density,.,neutral,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,unextractable data for juveniles (coral colonies with diameter <2cm)

Few studies, however, have explored the effects of MPAs on the demographic profiles of reef fish populations. We tested the assumption that areas closed to fishing for >7 yr accumulate older individuals of a heavily targeted species, Lethrinus harak. Our survey design included 2 protected sites and 2 comparative fished sites. Using an age-based length-conversion method, a novel approach in tropical fisheries, otolith-derived demographic information was supplemented with underwater visual census data. This approach provided valuable insights into the population dynamics of this species at small spatial scales (<2 km(2)). We found considerable site-specific differences in the age structure of L. harak, with protected sites having greater mean ages and lower total mortality. There was indication of density-dependent growth as greater size-at-age occurred in fished sites where biomass had been depleted. Although female L. harak reach 50% maturity at 208 mm fork length (FL) or age 3.8 yr, it is the largest and oldest females (>260 mm FL and >9 yr) who make a disproportionate contribution to overall reproductive output, as ovary weight increases exponentially with both length and age. Currently size (L-c) and age (t(c)) at first capture is similar to 100 mm and 2 yr below the size (L-50) and age (t(50)) at first maturity. Numerous management scenarios based on minimum size limits were evaluated to determine which scenario would increase spawning biomass without compromising yield estimates. Our results demonstrate that effective implementation of MPAs allows a larger and older population to accrue, thus yielding considerable reproductive benefits.",36,2010,10.3354/meps08672,WOS:000280768100019,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,connectivity,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,same data team as Taylor 2012 already included in the MA
